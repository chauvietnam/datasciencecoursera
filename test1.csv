Well theysay they want honest reviews, but if you actually are too honest then they accuse you of being wrong.
After years off I again tried them in 2017 and they are now refusing to honor their promise to give a discount code for an honest review.
So I know they both go back on their word and cause a customer ridiculous amountsof time getting open communication from them.
Liftmode does not currently offer the better, more expensive forms of choline, instead only the bitartrate form.
Better companies are BulkSupplements.com and nootropicsdepot.com."1,2272,2273,0,Used bait and switch. Sent me item different than promised. Would not issue a return label after being put off for a week and several phone calls. Lied to or led me on repeatedly. Did not respond to emails.

Â A week later when they said it would be in we went to pick it up a young women said the person we ordered from was not in and that she didn't know if he even didn't ordered it. She acted like she could careless and told us she couldn't do anything for us.

I go multiplayer and THE MOTION CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE! I'm driving and it turns me off a cliff. Maybe it turns me the wrong way, it lags so there's a delay.

But no, now I have to explain that we can't because this game is God awful."4,1918,1919,2,"This place was beyond disappointing. A friend recommended it for a quick weekend trip with my sister. The location is the only plus. Great restaurants and shops all around us and we felt safe being out late at night in this area. But thank god we spent barely any time at the hotel. A few of the staff were friendly and helpful, a few were not. My sister asked to have hot water from the kitchen last night because they had just closed it and the lady refused to unlock the door for her. The beds are not comfortable. AC did not work in our room. The sound of the traffic is super loud pretty much all the time, with very thin windows in the whole building. And I've stayed in Euro style hotels in Seattle before but this feels more like a hostel. Here you're sharing two tiny toilet closets and one shower with 10 other rooms on the floor. They don't clean the showers well through the day and it took 10 minutes for the water to heat up. I will pay more $ and stay somewhere else next time."5,3850,3851,0,"I should have consulted my tech friend before purchasing this tablet. Lenovo's own support page is littered with complaints about ""corrupted SD cards"". Per Lenovo's set up option, I elected to format the SD card for internal storage and ..... the card was corrupted upon the next reboot of the device. The card became invisible to any other device (I was trying to format it). I finally got hold of my tech buddy and he explained where using an SD card (even the fastest) for app storage is a no go (software limitation). Best not to buy a device that has modest memory / storage if you imagine that you might some day push the limit. Excuse me now - I need to pack up this misleading device for its return trip to Amazon."6,3447,3448,1,"Trying to learning the Tarot from this book is kind of like trying to lose weight by eating anything you want to eat. I have a few books on Tarot, and unfortunately, in my opinion, this is one was a waste of money. I found it pretty much useless. If you ONLY want to make up your own meanings for the cards, fine, you might like this book. If you really are interested in the traditionally-associated meanings for the cards as a jumping off point to your own intuitive readings, buy a couple of different books to get a couple different takes on each card."7,4738,4739,0,"I ordered the Seattle Darkgray one.

Between 29 min and 2 hour 30 min there will be an hourly charge. I was late for less than 2 hours and got a full day charge because the hourly rate is half of the daily price and nobody has informed me about this. Customer service said when you are late for over 1.5 hour. It will count as 2 hours. So basically it means if you are over 1.5 hours late, there will be a whole day charge.
The grace period showed online is just a joke. Customer service are all Indian accent and really hard to understand and doesnÂ’t seem want help and just tell me to ask local position. And the local phone cannot be reached so I drove all the way to the airport. The guy there was nice and tried to help us but National has a really bad system.

I am extremely fit and walk 14 kilometers a day and am mentally fit. Years of experience with no accident, but refused a car not on ability, but AGE. They will however rent to 18-year-old with no experience. We were shocked and stranded in Venice with no car.

I just accidentally found this site and noticed Imogene's name so went on to read it. I was looking for a Beautiful Healthy fawn Frenchie with a really nice head and came across Imogene's ad, in dog fancy magazine i believe is were I saw her ad. I gave her a call, how nice she was on the phone. She informed me she had a returned male under a year old. A crazed women in California that starved the puppy and said a few vets checked out this dog and said he had elongated pallet. She said she did not know what they were talking about she didn't have that in her lines so she took him back and had him vet checked and put under by her vet to have his elongated pallet examined. He passed with flying colors by her vet and was for sale as a show quality potential stud. She would stand behind him and guarantee him 100 %. So I trusted her and sent her the Money for him. As soon as he arrived i told her he spits up Flem all the time, she told me to keep him on Bill jack dog food that is refrigerated. I did and it did nothing to help him. In the mean time a couple months went by and I sent her a $400 deposit on a female puppy. She sold the puppy I sent the deposit for and would not return my deposit or my calls or emails. I had to send a friend that was passing thru her state to her door to ask for the refund she would not answer the door but shortly after i did receive a $400 refund in the mail. The Male i bought from her around April 2002 died suddenly with no warning Oct 2003. autopsy showed his lungs filled up with blood due to a small hole that leaked fluid over time to eventually kill him. My vet said it was congenital. I called Imogene, She was sorry but would not stand behind her dogs. I noticed a women named Lisa In California had a similar sounding problem with one of Imogene's dogs that she returned. I wonder if I bought the dog she returned with health issues? How come Imogene's vet passed this FrenchieÂ’s exam? And how come she wouldn't stand behind her dog when he died from abnormalities? Shouldn't a decent breeder stand behind there dogs with health issues! NOT all people are trying to get something for nothing. I just wanted a healthy Frenchie from a decent breeder.Â "17,72,73,0,"I visited this bar on Sat, Feb 4, with my 3 adult children. I turned 54 in Jan and they had given me an overnight trip to Savannah with just them for my gift. It was our first get away together, just the 4 of us, ever. We had walked along the river, stopped and had lunch, were walking in stores, and...Â my son and daughter ended up going to The Bar while my daughter and I finished looking around the city marketplace. When we met up with them, they were sitting at the far end of the bar, just the two of them, so we joined. The bartenderÂ’s demeanor completely changed. He asked my oldest daughter, who was wearing a purple hat, why she had a had on and told her she seemed bitter. He also said he could tell we were all from Florida because of the amount of make up wore. I think we all still felt in some way that he was teasing, and it was his way of making conversation. He then asked if any of my children were married (no) or had children. My middle daughter said she had a daughter and was pregnant again, hence why she was only drinking water and we all laughed. His comment was ""so you screwed up the first time and your trying again."" We pulled up a picture on our phone to show how beautiful my grand daughter is and he said she was cute. Still trying to take this as a person with just a different personality. My son announced we were celebrating my birthday and asked for birthday shots. The bartender was agreeable, but I totally refused to drink a shot. The part that bothered me worst is that after my son began talking to him (my son has a speech impairment) the bartender looked at me and said ""he didn't go to college or finish school did he?"" i couldn't believe he made that comment and I didn't know how to handle so I repeated ""did he go to school?"" he said ""did he finish school?"" My daughter went to comment and he ""shushed"" her. I was mortified. My daughter tested up and we tabbed out. The bartender knew he had visibly upset us and didn't have us pay for the two shots my son and daughter did. There's a lot to this but here's the think. My son is 27 and is so self-conscious with little to no self esteem. This completely crushed him, He was embarrassed and humiliated in front of all of us. As we walked back to our room he kept saying ""do you realize how bad that guy just disrespected me?"" He wanted to go back but we knew that wasn't a good idea as we all were very angry and upset. We were just a family trying to enjoy s quick out-of-town trip together and this happened. No one, no one, should ever speak to another individual like that much less an employee to customers...not one, he put down all of us. You can apologize but the hurtful words will forever stick with my son. I don't know what I want, other than someone to hear my complaint and hopefully get this employee away from people. I reached out to the restaurant twice but still have not received a call back. This was totally unacceptable, and mother, even though my kids are grown, it completely broke my heart. I cried at the hotel where my children couldn't see, I cried when I got home and told my husband, and I cried today telling my sister. I just know how much it insulted and hurt my son. Something you can't get past. We did nothing to this person. He was just rude, nasty, and shouldn't be allowed to serve people"18,512,513,1,"Ronald and Helen Greenberg promote their Microdermabrasion equipment which they say is ground breaking.

I just received this product yesterday and let it charge overnight. On a quick side note: it does not state clearly on here that it comes with a charger so I purchased the Â“recommended accessoryÂ” separately and low and behold, now I have two. Strike one. After letting the battery charge for a good 24 hours before using, I started the job of trimming my three dogs nails. Dog one and dog two went well, very slow, but well. The speeds on this thing are too slow for my taste, however grooming dogs is part of my every day career so I donÂ’t have the time nor the patience to use a Dremel this slow. Frankly neither do my dogs who were getting much more antsy than normal. Strike two. After finishing dog two I started on dog threes nails. Halfway through her nails the dremel slowed down significantly eventually to the point where I couldnÂ’t put any pressure on the nail to grind it without the dremel coming to a complete stop. I couldnÂ’t even completely finish her nails. Strike three. I used the dremel for less than 25 minutes and it couldnÂ’t handle that? I was on the fence about this dremel in the first place and now I know that I should have dished out for a regular dremel and not these pet specific waste of money kind. Not a happy dog mom right now. I will be returning this thing if it doesnÂ’t get tossed in the trash before I can make it to the mailbox.P.S. Storm aka dog three, gives this dremel two paws down!"22,4800,4801,2,"I went from the George Castanza wallet to this one and I loved the size and design of it.

I was in a hurry to get a new one as I was traveling so I simply reordered a new one hoping for better luck. What I don't appreciate is the co-founder of this company hounding me to review his product multiple times - well he gets his wish with a 1 star rating. Also frustrating is that this was listed as a Prime item and it arrived late so it missed the trip I needed it for. The 1 star rating is for the product itself but I would gave the same one for the company."23,3831,3832,1,"Revise my review. Not very happy with tablet <U+2639><U+FE0F>.

After confronting the service rep, he states that it was brought in with the scratch. He points to his paperwork showing the VERY large scuff on the corner of my bumper. First off, I did not sign the documentation when I dropped it off. So I ask, why didn't I get a copy once I dropped it off? ""Oh, we only give it if requested."" So, I ask where is the camera footage, so we can put this to rest. Oh, we don't have any cameras. How convenient for Dodge, no cameras or paperwork given to the customer unless it's requested. See the attached photo of how close the park attendants get to the pillars. You will see all the scuff marks on the white pillar, they cannot tell me the scuffs are done by shopping carts or any other fantasy excuse. The service guy was beyond rude to say the least. At one point there was a service attendant leaving his desk, he turned to the lady next to him (who was really nice by the way) and says ""Don't you have those days you want to punch someone in the face!"" Regardless of how bad your day, you don't threaten another person, period. Especially not in front of customers. At the end, they were willing to split the cost with me. It was $250 worth of damage, and I paid $125. For me, it's not the money. It's my time wasted, and having to deal with rude customer service. The service center should not work there at all, with the small interactions I had with coworkers of his, their response was ""I just don't go near that guy."" He is that guy in the work place, someone who no one likes working with but they have to deal with it. Do not take my word for it (management if you're reading this). Do a blind moral survey, and see how everyone feels about the office. As for me, I will not take my vehicle over there any more and will recommend everyone to stay away. You don't treat customers the way he does, nor fellow coworkers. While bragging of 30+ years of working at Dodge, it goes to show how far he has advanced... and for obvious reasons. If anyone still insists on going to Dodge Manhattan for ANY reason, make sure you request a copy of the damage report BEFORE leaving (they will not voluntarily give it to you.) Take a few pictures of your car and move about your day. I spent two days going back and forth with them, and a full day at the autobody shop (they were great!). In the world of online reviews, Dodge Manhattan should pay a little more attention on what is being said on the net. If anyone would like to contact me from Dodge, please do so.Â "25,980,981,1,"This is the most poorly written software i have ever come across.

Yet be aware this is totally subject to airline rules and they would not honor this policy in spite of their own mistakes. A few weeks ago I bought tickets from a cheap airline company in Asia because Expedia is the only website showing the fare was for businessÂ class and hence no need to pay for luggage -- cheap airlines have very strict rules and your carry-on luggage cannot exceed 12 kilos. So I was happy to make the purchase. However after I received the itinerary, my ticket was mysteriously changed to economy class. I called them up even if I was out the country, and they acknowledged that it was a technical error, yet they cannot cancel the ticket even if the ticket was booked less than 20 minutes ago. Worse still, when I complained that I would bring up the issue to BBB, the supervisor got very aggressive and eventually offered compensation (less than one-third of what I paid) on promise that I will let the issue rest. So instead of rectifying their mistake, they have no shame in covering up and ribbing off the customers."27,966,967,1,"A week before valentinesÂ’ day I thought I would order a present for my boyfriend at gifts.com.

It would be one thing if their website stated that the lenses were on backorder/out of stock, but it didn't and gave every impression they would be able to fulfill my order in a timely manner.

This stone does ok for tools like shovels or axes, but I just couldn't get the hang of it with knives. The diamond stones were too coarse and seemed to really grab the edge and prevent you from maintaining your angle. The absurdly fat handle also gets in the way when you're trying to sharpen, rending a good quarter of the stones useless for most tasks. I ended up picking up a set of credit card diamond stones and am much happier with my result.Adding a star because due to how handy this sharpener is for garden tools. I'm able to touch up the edge on items like mower blades without unmounting. Unlike a file, the diamond stones give you alot of control over the material you're removing so I'm not worried about thowing off the blade's balance. The handle that's annoying for sharpening knives works much better for tools where I'm more worried about comfort and protection over precision. If it were a few dollars cheaper I would add a star or two, unfortunately it's too much money for a tool on permanent lawn and garden duty."33,3683,3684,2,"I've worn court and running shoes the majority of my life (over dress and other styles). They are what I wear when I go out somewhere and what I wear to work, so the style and feel are very important to me. I've got several miles on these shoes now, so I'm comfortable writing a review.For style, these shoes look pretty nice. Stitching and glue and whatever else holds these together looks well done and no obvious defects in craftsmanship. Material is easy to wipe clear so far. The tongue is a little bit narrow and I've noticed that at times, I can see my sock if I don't center the tongue perfectly. That is a little bit annoying as I've never owned a pair of shoes where I was worried about the tongue.For comfort, I've ended up a bit disappointed. After long walks and sometimes even just driving, my feet ache and tingle. There's something about the arch and tightness across the bridge that makes my foot uncomfortable. I'm generally a 11 extra wide and found a size 11 XW. In the toe section, these shoes feel about like every other extra wide. Length seemed good and I had little movement in the heal. The part that didn't make sense to me was in the bridge over the top the middle of foot. It's tight. The tongue of the shoe is kind of narrow to begin with, so as I've loosened the shoe more and more to help my foot not feel like it was being strangled, the tongue now can allow my sock to show.

Â Useful"36,677,678,2,"I purchased a GT Aggressor Pro bike at DickÂ’s on July 4th 2017. Along with the bike I purchased the warranty maintenance plan suggested by the associate; a 2 year warranty plan that cost me $46.99+tax. I purchased this bike at Sycamore Commons 10530 Ne Parkway, Suite J - Matthews, NC 28105, not sure about store number.
Beginning July this year I took the bike back to the same store for tune up included with warranty plan and general check up. Left the bike at store on a Sunday, and on Tuesday called me letting me know the bike needed parts replaced that were included in warranty plan. He also told me that he was going on vacation for a week and that he would order the parts before leaving. I was able to pick up my bike so I could ride it while he went on vacation. A week later I took the bike back for repair (Sunday) and waited to hear from...
Two weeks went by, and I never heard from so I called to find out that the bike had not been touched, and it was just hanging from the ceiling. Meanwhile, I hadnÂ’t been able to ride my bike for over 2 weeks. When I asked why such a delay in repairing the bike I was informed that only works one night per week (Tuesday), and he has to fix the bikes but also assemble bikes for the store. I was extremely upset that when I bought the warranty/maintenance suggested plan no one mentioned that there is only one technician that works only one night per week. I find that inadmissible for a company as big as DickÂ’s.
I went to pick up my bike that day with nothing repaired, and spoke to and the store manager that told me I could have gone to another store where they have more technicians. I bought my bike at that store, I purchased the warranty/maintenance plan at that store, and I live in the neighborhood, I didnÂ’t think I had to go to another store for fast service (that was a first I heard of it). Also guaranteed me that he was waiting on the parts for the bike but until I called that day there was no communication. If there had been communication I could have picked up my bike and ride it until the parts came in.
So basically I purchased a maintenance plan that I did not use, I have now this bike for sale, and I will never enter a DickÂ’s store in my life again. Also, every time I went to that store I had to request for someone to come to the Bikes department, and it was always from Guns department that had to come. I believe investing in more labor would be helpful to customers."37,2573,2574,2,"Dangerously addictive. When I was in the clutches of the game, several aspects of my life suffered.

I couldn't even watch TV without multi-tasking with candy crush.I finally deleted it from my phone and had to re-learn a bit of self discipline to detox this game out of my mind.

Sure, there's gross stuff in the little patch, but I'm honestly a little dubious as to whether it's ""sucking"" anything out or just having a chemical reaction since the zits themselves don't really appear to be reduced much. Even after using them over multiple days, I don't think the patch is doing anything for me that the passage of time is not.

She lost me at books, and the idea that books are merely paper and printed words. NO! Books reflect an owner's lifetime of aspiration and curiosity and study and knowledge. They reflect how we see ourselves. The ones read before are cherished as part of one's history, the date(s) when read perhaps noted on the front page. They hold vivid memories of who we were when we first read or acquired them. The last ones I'd ever discard are the ones I've already read, unless of course I found them as inane as Ms. Kondo's book. I get the idea of ""sparking joy,"" and I understand that there are people so overwhelmed by junk that they can't figure out where to begin, but for others of us, happiness and memories are embedded in our possessions, and would be lost in the absence of them. Some of us are collectors. Some have saved for a lifetime as the historians of our lives. The goal of such lives is to surround ourselves with cherished possessions and enjoy them, not to sip herbal tea of an afternoon with nothing to look at but a bouquet of flowers -- the ideal state of being Ms. Kondo holds out. Ms. Kondo says she wants to enable readers to decide what to keep, but in fact her method of piling every book or stitch of clothing in one place is designed to shame people into discarding, and she really doesn't care where it goes. Mountains of waste for landfills are just fine as long as they leave the house. At least to this reader, advocating turning possessions into waste withing making a serious effort to sell or donate the best of them is irresponsible. We all should be free from guilt packing things away so that they may ""spark joy"" another day, or simply find new utility when our lifestyles change again.

They had my reservation on file and asked how many people I had and all. I explained what Josh and I had discussed. I was told that I was only allowed 10 people and the rest would have to pay cover despite the fact that I had emails between Josh and myself stating that I would not have to pay. The bouncer was giving me a hard time so I agreed to pay cover for the additional people. Then he continued saying that I would be better off with one more bottle since I would be paying cover for the additional people at $30 per person. So I agreed to buy an extra bottle instead of paying cover. The bouncer takes my ID and credit card then returns a few minutes later to tell me he has no table for me. I asked for an explanation and he tells me that he sold my table to a party that was paying more than me. It was literally a complete scam. Hudson Terrace did not honor any part of my agreement with the promoter that their club works with. They turned me away saying that there are plenty of other places in NYC."68,4026,4027,2,"I ordered these because the headline is ""Kleenex Ultra Soft & Strong Facial Tissues."" What I received was a case of Kleenex Ultra Soft. Is there a difference? YES! Ultra Soft are useless. For some reason my supermarket only sells Kleenex ""Trusted Care"" and ""Ultra Soft"" which are both Ultra Soft. Ultra Soft is thin, brittle, and when you pull a tissue, out comes a huge puff of fibers (that cause me to continue to sneeze). Think I'm kidding? Pull out one of these tissues through a ray of direct sunlight. I need to use more than 2 tissues when I sneeze and another two more to blow my nose. With ""Ultra Soft and Strong"" I only need one tissue. DO NOT BUY THESE!! If you get a box that only says ""Ultra Soft"" or ""Trusted Care"" return it, or throw them away. Don't believe me? You'll see. I returned these as soon as I only saw ""Ultra Soft."""69,3533,3534,0,"I will break down this review into subsections so you can refer to areas you are concerned about. I will preface this review by saying I am very skeptical of brands I do not know, have not heard of, or have not had others refer me to them, and in fact will stay away from them until one of the three criteria above is met. That being said, my normal headphone provider Skullcandy has had massive amounts of negative reviews on their wireless earbuds, and Amazon said these were the top rated and their suggestion. As such I took the risk and bought them. Now to the review itself.Noise Cancellation: It goes without saying that earbuds in general are noise cancelling as they block a large amount of sound from coming in and personally I do not notice a significant difference between these and my average headphones. They are far less noise cancelling than my gaming headset but I also spent far more on my headset and its designed specifically for that task. Personally, I would say they are noise cancelling, but not more than other earbuds.Sound Quality: I am rather surprised by the sound quality of these considering the price point. A large portion of cost goes into Bluetooth and batteries to keep them on. That being said I had figured the sound quality would be subpar. BOY HOW WRONG WAS I. These things are incredibly nice. If you jack the volume up too high it will get a bit bassy but thats not a big deal considering i listen to them anywhere between 10-50% volume. The microphone quality on these are horrible though. They will pick up and amplify everything. Don't expect to get much out of it.Battery life: My extent of testing the battery life was using them for about an hour, looking at the battery life remaining and seeing 100%. Obviously that is incorrect, but time will tell how long these will actually last.Waterproof or not: Have not tested, however I would assume by the design of these, that would hold true. I have washed older headphones in the wash and dryer multiple times and never had issues, so i would be surprised if newer headphones couldn't do the same. I will update this when i have acquired more data.For Extended Use (Work/Gym/Exercise): These earbuds are very comfy, you cant really tell you are wearing them other than the obvious earbud feeling in your ears. The only concern here is battery life over how often you will use them. I personally work up to 12 hour days, and will wind up having these in almost all of it. The battery will most likely die before I wind up finishing my work day but the good news is there is a fancy pause button on the right ear that will allow me to stop listening to whatever i am listening to at a moments notice and continue right back where i left off when i wish to. Again time will tell.Design Pros/Cons: The volume controls are inverted from what i would expect them to be. On the top of the right ear are two buttons (Easily Accessible). However, the front button is volume down and the back button is up. I personally would have volume up in the front and down in the back, as forward/up and backwards/down, but maybe that's just me being weird. Easy enough play button on the side of the right ear. The left ear has no controls whatsoever and makes the headset appear to be similar to older computer stereos, all controls on a main unit with just a connected speaker by a single wire. This comes with replacement buds, in case the ones currently installed are uncomfortable, and the connecting wire is small, and unnoticeable in my opinion.Recommend or not: For $20 I do not see you getting a better pair of earbuds that are bluetooth with the sound quality yet being very power efficient. That being said, These get a 5 star, despite the 3 star in noise cancellation and 4 in sound quality. Totally Worth it.Edit #1: Changed to a 2 star review After Approximately 3 months of all day use for roughly 80 days over those 3 months I can say the constant recharging has shot the battery. They worked every day fabulously but now i have noticed that the battery lasts roughly 4 hours now when originally it was over 12 hours."70,3264,3265,0,This book was VERY disappointing!

I can only wear these about 30-60 minutes at a time, then I need to take them off for a break. I've been forcefully stretching them (placing the ear pads on either end of an 11"" book) for many hours during the day, and throughout the night, but it hasn't been helping too much.

I've been using the one out of my toolbox for months and it was great. Today I went to use the one at home because my toolbox was left at my other studio, and the one at home doesn't work. It literally doesn't work. It's a piece of metal with a blade screwed to it, and when you insert a pencil (I've tried about 6 different ones) and turn it nothing happens.

However, if someone expects to come up with a really sharp blade you will be disappointed. I assume the issue is that the sanding belt will flex a lot and consequently the cutting edge is being rounded.Also, by using the guide one side of the blade will get an upstroke while the other side of the same blade will receive a down stroke. This matters little for some rough cutting tools but you will not achieve a honed edge on a quality knife."81,4077,4078,0,"Great price, great shipping.

At first I thought it was just a bad batch, but it's not, it's poor manufacturing. All packs I've ordered have fallen apart in a very short period of time.

It finally came out and I cut in and sure thing it's rare. blood was seeping out all over the plate and onto my mash potatoes so I sent it back.

My husband enjoyed his dinner but by the time my food came out he had finished. I decided I didn't want the steak after their third attempt of the manager bringing it out charred well done. I work at a steakhouse myself and we always do our best to ensure that the guest enjoys their meal and they get what they pay for. Bjs is not a cheap place so you'd thing that their priority is to get their food to a standard that the guest enjoys.

Wednesday, they delivered the used floor model trolley, not a new one in the box. It came covered in a black plastic trash bag. It has dents, scratches and dirty fingerprints everywhere. Wednesday, after my 5th call trying to reach Flamingo Beauty Supply, they promised that the driver will pick up the used trolley and deliver the new one on Thursday. After which, I explicitly requested them to deliver it by Thursday October 26, or issue me a refund if they cannot. It was getting ridiculously unprofessional. No one came on Thursday to deliver the proper trolley. No one called either. The new trolley did not arrive Thursday, and now they don't want to issue me a refund.

By 1 o'clock we received no phone call and resorted to calling the office ourselves and were informed that the job before ours was running late. To fast forward a little bit the movers arrived at 4:30!!!! I cannot even begin to explain how stressful the waiting period was. When they did finally arrive the movers were not uniformed and had the audacity to greet us with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth. After the move was complete we spoke to the manager of the Toronto office regarding a discount for the significant delays and the maximum he offered us a negligible amount and told us that he would speak to the GM to approve a higher discount.

Sound is weak compared to my previous table, but not by much. Screen is not great but okay. My problem came when I tried to install Kodi and I could not install. It said it was not compatible. That seemed odd as I had it on my other tablet. A little research showed me why. In the settings about version it lists Android 5.0. Tap it a few times and the animation comes up with a K for Kitkat. That is version 4.4.Not only does this possibly present security issues, though it looks like they are recent builds so maybe they are patched, it presents a problem running new software.

It has a 1.3 GHz processor compared to the listed 4 GB RAM and 2.5 GHz processor that the Yellyouch supposedly has. Under a magnifying glass pixelation was simlar but the Acer screen was day and night better. THe Acer also saw my 5G wifi which the Yellyouth did not. The Acer was smoother and faster but after opening just 4-5 apps the Yellyouth lagged and the Acer was smooth as butter and way faster. It would also load Kodi. The Acer actually has Adnroid 7 it easily reads my 128 GB micor SD which the Yellyouth would not even read in USB to go mode and I paid less for it!My final assessment is that most likely the Yellyouth tablet doesn't handle newer faster wifi for the same reason the screen is so horrible, it is so slow and lags so much. Why would a manufacturer put a 4 year old OS on new hardware? Duh? They woudn't. I believe this tablet is either several years old or maunfactured from old parts. I suspect it has unpatched security issues though I can't be sure but given the amount of fraud here I see no reason to trust them.

The Aesthetics Medical Educators Training program is hands down the absolute worst course I have ever attended in my entire life! My partner said I should check out a company called esiw but they had bad reviews also, I think anything would have been better. I paid almost $2,000 dollars for this course! I am so upset and trying to get my money back. For $2,000, if you can believe I had to print out my own materials and bring them to the course! NO handout, no manual!!! I should have known at that point that the course was a scam but the website looked good and I made the mistake. I expected quality hand outs, print materials, charts, whatever, not a short black and white copy of a power point presentation. After the course I went back read that if you want a manual you have to pay an extra $50, I have never heard of a company charging $50 for a book that is supposed to come with the class. And then, they state that they are just being friendly to the environment They must think their readers are stupid! I guess I am for registering for this class. I want to report this company to some agency I don't know who or how but I will find out. The instructor who taught the class should not have been teaching. I would have expected a plastic surgeon or at least some high level Aesthetics physician. The instructor knew very little about the course material and probably never performed these techniques in private practice either. (This however, I cannot stat for certain. Its just that the quality of training was so basic that there is no way the instructor could be doing this in practice). If I had stayed home and watched a YouTube video I probably would have learned more. I can write for another hour but I have to stop somewhere. The hand on was a complete kole. I practiced very little and IÂ’m not even sure what this company is doing is legal because they are charging their patients for procedures and there is not established physician patient relationship, the set up was unorganized, they violated every HIPPA law, osha, biohazard conditions, and quite frankly, I felt very uncomfortable being at this program as if it were run by NON MEDICAL PEOPLE who know nothing about practicing medicine, a little scary."101,1011,1012,1,"First of all, most of the items I got from this website don't look like the photos they show. A lot cheaper materials like made in China but I only bought all that they state as ""made in Korea"" and the price is like $100 for two pieces.

Secondly, it took them almost 2 weeks just to send out to ship your items. Yes almost 2 weeks!!!! so by the time you get your stuffs, that could be 3-4 weeks.
Thirdly, they charged my card with some foreign transaction, but they promoted themselves as in the US. Scam!
And finally, they shipped me a wrong color of the item and tried to accuse me in the wrong. I showed then the proof, but they still reject to give me refund on my credit card but they insist me to ship it back to them with my own money for postage and they will only give back stock credit.

They were having troubles with their online server at the time, and didn't have access to my new account information. The clothes were only on sale for a few more hours so my son paid for them with his PayPal. It wasn't their fault. I paid my first billing from Roaman's in full for my original order.

When I received the statement I realized they don't automatically take the second $10.00 off the bill like the first order. I called Roaman's and explained my situation. I waited 30 minutes and had to talk to a rep, a fit specialist and finally customer service. Customer Service told me they could not give me $10.00 off unless I ordered another order on my credit card because that's the way it is done.
I said that is fine, but I'm not interested in purchasing anything right now after already purchasing $200.00 worth of clothing.

I guess if it did, they will lose business. In terms of this, this site (as well as most dating sites) is a scam.1. Your message is not directly delivered. Your message is only visible to the receiver if they ""like"" you. I do notÂ understand why any person would write a proper introduction to someone or more than a few words because the chances of your message being read is nearly non-existent.
2. The matching process is superficial. You're basically matched by the pictures and a small introduction, assuming there's mutual ""liking"" of these two criteria. As mentioned above (no.1), there's no mutual selection happening based on a conversation. Looks do matter, but when there's profile after profile to choose from, the selection process becomes too superficial.
3. They do not show all available profiles in your area, so good luck if you live in a small town. Every time I refresh the browsing page, the same few people shows up. As I've found out, you must ""pass / unlike"" them in order to have a new person shown to you. Algorithms are against users in this case.

It's as if they are 11.5-gal bags, not designed to hold the contents of a 13-gal trash can so that the customer has to use up the box of bags faster. No, really?

The drinks were only $8.00 and she only credited me for $4.80 he asked why and she didn't have a reason, so Becca ran my credit card again for $8.65 (without my card) so now on my bank statement it shows $14.54. So I go back in again and asked for her to show me where my credit is because I'm showing she ran my card again without issuing me a credit. She refused to show me and she got all upset but all I was asking was to show me where you credit me back. I told her it seem like she was trying to be slick and not fully take my drink off like she said she would. Instead she only took off half price.

The agreed upon price was $40 plus tax. He looks at me and tells me the total price is $52. What? $52? So there's $12 tax on $40? I tell him no, I'm not paying that, his math is wrong. He looks at me funny. I have to tell this guy, who's in business, how to figure out tax. 40 x 1.13 = 45.20, NOT $52. Sad part is, he was not commiting a crime, he was not pulling a fast one.

I booked my room onÂ bookings.comÂ and it said $157 a night- and let me tell you, that was the deal I was looking for. Furthermore, after MANY fees the total said it would come out to around 615$ total for 3 nights. I was pretty shocked but at this point when I realized the price, i had already put down the $250 hold. But, whatever.. right? On the site it had said there was breakfast, and what looked to be a ""luxury"" room - the Cali King Deluxe. When I arrived, they said that there was going to be at least a $100 hold as well per night, that we would probably get back. The website did not mention this. My friend runs his card and it turns out that they released the $250 hold from my card and straight up charged him over $900. My friend was lucky that he had enough money to cover- but you would think someone would have mentioned this beforehand. Then, we get to the room. Windows don't open & no fan for the bathroom. It was also pretty small. We were just trying to light of the situation at this point. BUT THEN, the next day rolls around and we're thinking we're about to get some hotel- included breakfast. Well friends, it doesn't work that way here. We ask front desk about breakfast and he says he's unaware of where it's located. We walk around in the very nice looking lobby & find it in the restaurant area. We're thinking ""yessss at last"" after walking around for like 15 minutes not knowing where we're going, lol. We walk in, grab one plate each and load it. We sit down and a waiter comes up to us and asks if we would like anything to drink and says that it's free. We both get water and then my guy friend, leaves to go to the bathroom shortly after. The second he leaves a new waiter comes by and asks to see my room key. I say that my friend has it. He says ""well, it needs to a black room key"" WITHOUT EVEN SEEING IT and then plops a bill in front of me and says ""if you have a problem, talk to the front desk"" I open it & guess how much it is. $72!!! Turns out that the only people who get breakfast are what seem to be ""elites"". The Hyatt Regency website didn't say that either. What a shock. Â I get up frantically to find my friend to tell him (I didn't bring my phone downstairs w me) and since I didn't know where the bathroom was I was walking around and then when I got even remotely close to the elevator area (the layout is weird and there's a bunch of random business rooms near there so I assumed the bathroom would be there too) I got CHASED DOWN by 3 waiters AND the guy at the front desk. It was embarrassing because there was people everywhere Â I didn't even know how to react and one of the waiters has the bill in hand from our table and yells ""YOU NEED TO PAY FOR THIS!!"" -- honestly, it was kind of traumatic. Now looking back, I realize that everyone was really just watching us the whole time and waiting for us to get some food just so they could charge us for it. And the craziest thing to me is where did they think I was gonna go??? This is where I was staying for the next 2 days.

Â Nick's has been open for over 40 years, but now this once wonderful restaurant is being run by the grand kids of the original owner Nick their grandfather. Â Dominic Jr., the grandson is a poor example of a manager. Â He walks around half asleep, completely uninterested in anything that resembles a true Italian Host. Â Perhaps, he has a drug problem, because he surely looks lethargic at times, hiding in a tiny little office when he should be greeting guests, answering the phone, and acting like he cared a little. Â He calls in sick, comes in late, basically doesn't care at all. Â Nicky, the grand daughter, is the most horrible example of an unkept, lazy little girl (because thats how she acts totally immature) and will do or say any lie to get out of doing any real work. Â This Nicky, is a complete and total slob (hair and clothing looks dirty), makes excuses to get out of real work, and eats like a complete pig the entire time she is on her shift.

I have ordered all of my Nintendo Switch games from Amazon, all so far have been great. I have a solid collection of 13 physical games which arrived on the release date (and a day sooner on one instance with Xenoblade Chronicles 2). This is a first for me, I didn't receive any updates on shipping beyond the first couple locations it visited, and nothing for it being out for delivery or shipped. What ever, no biggy. I went to get the mail just to check if it was there and it was. I went back into my house excited to play the new Smash, hastily taking off the rapping which was loose, I was able to rip it right open with a single finger but I have had games like that so I didn't pay attention to that. I took my current game out of my Switch and put it away then I finally got around to opening the box and. no game. it was empty. nothing in it. Like I said, I have ordered a lot of my switch games from Amazon when I was preordering because of the good deal that it was. They no longer do that so I have no reason to go on ordering my games from Amazon especially saying how I paid $55 for a piece of plastic with a colorful pallet that is pleasing to the eyes. I am going to attempt getting a refund but I highly doubt that I can in a situation like this. I just want to play Smash. Thank you."138,2669,2670,0,The gel in the container should be blue not white and should smell much different. I bought this originally from Target and loved it.

Very strange because we've lived with dogs in the past & do now currently, so we couldn't exactly pin point what my finance was allergic to with that breed- all in all, the dog did not work out unfortunately. Anyways, keeping our side of the agreement, we did as we signed in the adoption papers & not find him a new home ourselves, but gave him back to find a new home. Became very cold to us soon after. We were told we would get the $200 out of the $400 we paid initially for the adoption when the billing quarter ended in June.

A credible test should take time and should have the same basic questions for everyone.Sorta like a true ESP examination.A person should be qualified to test and screen a psychic reader and the questions asked should apply to everyone.I do find this to be true with most sites.Many screen their psychics but there decisions can be based on how well they like a person or if they think they can make money off of a person..It should be done by a professional who has the ability to make a true ESP examination."144,87,88,0,"I leased my car from Diamante Leasing in Brooklyn, with the contract signed with Nissan of Manhattan on DecemberÂ ,2016.

When it arrived, the chemical smell was so strong I couldn't keep it in the house. The bag arrived about 10 days before my trip, and I let it air out the entire time.

The Downtown Crossing location of Boston Sports Club is among the worst locations I have visited. Most issues stem from management's laziness. The free weights are not cleaned regularly to the point where it is possible to smell them from ten feet away. The men's locker room is often in disarray over the weekends with locker doors hanging off of their hinges, dirty towels laying all over the room, and standing pools of water near the shower area. The shower stalls themselves are an absolute mess. There are swarms of living flies in the stalls and members smash them against the shower walls which are never cleaned. In addition to the dead bugs, it's easy to tell that the staff doesn't clean the stalls because there has been a wet paper towel on the floor of one of the stalls every day for the past two weeks. Since management doesn't employ a cleaning person during the weekend, the locker room just gets worse and worse despite multiple staff members being on duty who are otherwise unoccupied and could clean up instead of sitting around. The conditions are so bad that this past weekend, one of the three toilets was clearly out of order, but used by a member anyway. Instead of fixing this or at least blocking off the area, the problem just sat there and will likely remain that way until Monday. In addition to just being generally disgusting, these things are health hazards. The worst part about this gym is that there is a well documented and chronic condition of laziness on the part of management. Read these reviews or those on Yelp and Google. There's nothing worse than a gym whose management is clearly aware of these types of issues and too lazy to do anything about it. That says everything you need to know in terms of how they view their patrons."158,777,778,1,"I recently purchased a dirt bike online through Powersports Distro.

Even after cancelling my auto-renewal (I'm a sucker for that price), I signed up for a ""free"" giveaway they were doing on their website. Hey, free tools are free tools! After I filled out the entry form, it brought me to a page that said, in essence, ""Would you like to subscribe? Give us your details and we'll bill you later!"" Naturally, I opted to not fill the form out and just closed out of the tab. But Family Handyman is like a garbage disposal hellbent on money. It wants your money. It NEEDS your money. It's sole purpose in life is to get your money and dispose of it on paper leaflets filled with ads. And Family Handyman was not happy it didn't get its money. So, about a week later, I got a renewal notification in my email inbox. I replied to them, saying that I did NOT want the subscription and that I was already subscribed. A few days later, they sent me a bill for $10. Now, I'm a disabled man. I am not made of money. I was born far, far away from the garden where the money tree grows. My income is limited, to say the least. So, while $10 may not seem like a lot...to someone who gets $34 a month that DOESN'T go to rent...that's almost a quarter of my monthly income. And Family Disposalman needed that money for ads. I emailed them AND filled out a form on their website to cancel the renewal and what was left of my subscription. A few days later, they acquiesced. I somehow managed to slay the monster and keep my precious ten dollars.The moral of this story is that, if you want a magazine mostly full of product pitches and predatory practices, go ahead and put your money down on the barrel for Family Handyman.

If the ""renowned"" psychologist (erhm, economist?) had mentioned, at least once, the feedback loops and neural circuitry involved in processesing information deliberately or automatically, I could have continued reading.

She asked the name and I gave it to her she informed me they just confirmed the order. More than 23 mins later they are just now putting he order in. I asked if there was an issue because the restaurant seemed rather slow again it's 448 now and she said it would be about 15 mins. The manager Cisly to me was very unpleasant imo but she did try to make it right by saying she was expediting the food. Unfortunately the pick up time was at 448 and it will be delivered late.

If you complain, the very rude woman on the cash register will yell at you at the top of her lungs, telling me that the light tree is broken. Well fine - the first time - but months later finding it still isn't working, you wonder if the under-spray and wax button just wasn't pushed and you are paying for the second level of service and getting the very basic level (no under-spray & no wax). The drier guys with cloths are very casual, talking to each other, and paying no attention to areas that obviously did't get clean by the automatic system. I asked for a damp towel and worked alongside them to really get my rocker panels clean and bird droppings off the roof. But the attitude of the woman on the cash (apparently the only ""boss"" you can complain to) is very loud and rude and unreceptive to your concerns."176,1627,1628,0,"16 dollars for swimming if you here before for any reason, activities, you have to pay.

I'm writing an update because I have now received two calls from Julie Ferman pleading with me to take the post down. The first call she asked me if I would change my mind if she offered me free membership. I refused. I wish I would have been smart enough to have researched and read a review like mine or any of the others to have refused the meeting. I do not want anyone else to go through the horrible experience I went through with her representative Courtney Hughes. At the end of the interview when she walked me to the elevator and I had made it crystal clear that I would not be writing a check she said to me ""Grace, I don't want to sound like a b*tch, but you really are starting to look 40."" I will never forget that. She knew of my impending 40th birthday and knew that a single women would be sensitive and vulnerable to such a comment. I could have answered many things considering she was older than myself, unmarried and had an ugly telephone exchange with her teen age daughter while I was there filling out forms. Instead I told her that I looked 40 because I was turning 40 and that's what 40 looks like and that I was ok with that.
I wrote the post on Yelp to warn or at least arm ladies from what they would be greeted with at Cupid's Coach. Julie Ferman, the owner called me weeks later about my post. Julie said that my experience with Courtney was not how she trained her reps to behave and then when I refused to delete my post she said I was being ""vindictive"" because she wouldn't fire Courtney, when I had not suggested any such thing. BTW, Courtney is now at Organic Matchmaker.
The second call from Julie was Saturday (12/15/2012), where again she said she wanted me to delete the post because it was causing her to lose clients. I told her once again that her service was one of the worst experiences I have had as a single women. She then said that I should seek therapy for the ""emotional scar"" that the interview had caused. Again, no one said ""emotional scar"" it was a truly horrible and hurtful experience. The berating is part of Cupid's Coach tactics as confirmed by Julie's calls. BEWARE READ THE REVIEWS and even the satisfied ones because we know they are phony, like the service. Julie, do not call me anymore, unless it is for advice on how to better serve single people looking for love. I will not change my post. You are not a nice person in my opinion.
Please see Julie's track record by checking out Cupid's Coach and the better business bureau under Cupid's Coach. The name change is a transparent attempt to shake her past performance. See my review and notice how the positive reviews seem or are entirely similar to the ones in this company.
JULIE-please don't contact me to change my review again. The only reason I'm posting is because I received an email from one of your previous clients thanking me for my post and letting me know what you are up to. Shame on you.
Okcupid, match, eharmony and meetup.com for singles groups with similar interests are great ways to meet other singles.

The subscription shouldend Feb 2013. RD had it ending in Nov 2012. Emailed Amazon, told them of the problem, and afterseveral tries, they go it fixed.Several months ago I noticed the expir date had mysteriously ""slipped"" to Jan 2013, from Feb 2013I contacted Amazon yet again, and once again Amazon got it fixed. I fully expect that one or twoof the remaining issues will get ""lost"" in the mail.Moral of the story: If you subscribe to Reader's Digest WATCH THEM VERY VERY CLOSELY. And,Amazon was great in helping out.More? Ordered a RD subscription myself and one for a friend. At year end I noticed I had paidfor 3, not 2, subscriptions. Never got a satisfactory answer from RD. This was several years ago.Another one? When my mother passed away I had RD sent to me for the remainder of the sub.When it expired RD started sending renewal notices. Having dealt with them before I just filed each one.After a few renewal notices, they changed into what looked like a bill. Then this ""non-bill"" morphedinto a bill, the came the demand for payment on this ""bill"". That was followed by a threat to turnher over for collection. One letter to them informing them of their ethics problem stopped the ""collection"".Go on the web and key in ""Readers Digest Complaints"" and see what pops up. It'll be a ton of them.After doing just that I learned that RD apparently cut EVERYONE's subscription expiration date bya month after printing a double issue. Of course, when they do a ""double issue"" they don't do anissue for the next month. Then, they use that as a lame excuse to take one month off your subscription.And, from what I read, I'd have never gotten the problem fixed had not Amazon went to bat for me once again.Just go on the web and take a look for yourself."180,674,675,2,"I opened a membership on a month to month, no obligation membership for 74.99 a month, I was charged $94.99 after all the taxes and I was not even going to the gym.

This location is brand new in the White Mountains. What attracted me to the store, was their special for valentineÂ’s day. I had the exam, dealation, etc. My insurance covered all the exam but 18.00. Great! So far, I saw a pair of Ray Bans I wanted for the eyeglasses and a pair for the sunglasses that I NEED TO WEAR WHILE DRIVING. The eyeglasses I chose with the prescription turned out to be little close to $500.00. The sunglasses would be another $399.00 so for both pairs, $999.00. This was not the special advertised. Buy one get one 50% off. Not on designer glasses or sunglasses (SMALL PRINT NOT RAYBANS). I eventually settled on a pair glasses that were cheaper, but not by much. I felt at the mercy of the Store, I needed my glasses, and they were going to get paid. I was angry. I said to the clinician, (salesperson) you expect to charge that much for glasses up here? WOW! people will go broke up here. What isn't good for me, I have to wear glasses, I can't see while I drive, and need sunglasses. I wear my glasses while at work, in the house, in stores. But, not while driving. I presented Nationwide with providing my own sunglass frame and filling the prescription with their lenses. It didn't matter, 358.00 with polarization and 349.00 without. I was shocked. This company grouches people who are at the mercy due to the fact, people need to see. Now, I am super mad, and will never, ever go there again.

I have had the exact set before but I took it to a friends place once and it never came back! They loved it...so much for the game itself.I ordered it again in December 2018 but was disappointed to see that quality of the materials used has deteriorated considerably. The chips are lighter, cheaper plastic, the fold-able board seems fragile, the card deck is very very light - almost feels a tad thicker than printer paper. Instructions now printed on what seems like recycled paper (I don't mind that, but worth noting). Yes, I did get it for a bargain at $12. However, now it makes sense why the price was low. Too bad that they made it look like an offer price. Honestly I would not mind paying $20 for a better quality version. Should have tried the Tin case version, but who knows if they are any different.If anyone is reading for what the game is like - CLASSIC.

I loved it from the beginning and it worked really well to keep me moisturized. I started ordering it from amazon and had reordered maybe 9-10 times when I received a jar that was not at all the same product. When I opened the jar it had a strong chlorine smell. I sent it back to amazon for a replacement and the next jar was the same. I had used about 20 jars of this stuff before these two, I knew something was weird. I took it to my dermo and she agreed that it was off. I used it for a little to see if the ingredients were the same( before I showed my dermo)... maybe new formula? But it wasnÂ’t as moisturizing and left my face with that smell that my boyfriend even pointed out. I went to target and bought one and of course, no scent, exactly how I remembered. Amazon refunded me the jar of whatever the heck I was putting on my face but be aware, if you get this and it has any hint of a smell, especially chlorine, send it back, thatÂ’s not right. I did also compare ingredients to see if they had changed anything and it all read the same. The product I got either went bad or was not the same thing, end of story. IÂ’d give the real product a 5 across the board but just be careful with what you get. Maybe try target first to confirm what it should be like."185,1479,1480,2,"We live across town in Ypsilanti Township and were just having one of those "" running sorta behind days"".

I also do love the concept of the dice being large, however it is really difficult to roll all dice at the same time unless you stack them on top of each other.

As much as I liked these while using them, a mid range pair f headphones should still last longer than 8 months...I'd recommend you go for something a little more high end that won't fail you after less than a year.

I thought there was something wrong with the trackpad as it would keep going crazy. Turns out it wasn't the track pad but was the touch screen. There was a hairline crack in it that I couldnt see while using it.

I had an awful experience with buying a 65Â” tv from them online. They told me IÂ’d have the TV in 5-7 business days but then the way they ship these units it actually is double the time. Even after speaking with Abt customer service and after an hour having them cancel the order and NOT charge me a restocking fee (this should tell us they donÂ’t care about customer service charging folks for items that haven't even shipped just to get $$ from you).
After all of this was worked out with Abt to return. I get a phone call and an email from Randy Abt GM telling me he did me a favor and didnÂ’t cancel because he could guarantee the delivery date I was expecting. He assured me over and over again it would happen. Of course it didnÂ’t as a few days later I was told It was delayed, wouldnÂ’t make the delivery date and I had to start all over again with cancelling the order and now paying out of pocket to the TV installation service for cancelling twice. Go anywhere but here! Everyone sells TVs and you can get them in a few days. DonÂ’t buy their excuse of using specialized shipping methods and carriers that takes 2 weeks from IL to NJ. They make guarantees they canÂ’t deliver on and no pun intended here."210,2390,2391,1,They do not communicate effectively and you might end up being thrown out of your house.

Someone comes up with the brilliant idea of Dominion Square Tavern deviled eggs and before you know it, 6 of us all of a sudden have the same craving.
They don't do delivery as they are a classy joint, which is fine, ok, but they do package up the remainders of your lunch or dinner, so they do have take away containers. We sent a friend over to sit at the bar, have a drink and then order some deviled eggs. He was going to eat a few and then bring the rest over to us. The waiter kiboshed that idea and said that we were breaking the take away rules. OK, you caught us, but given that a single deviled egg goes for 5$, you do the math: they just lost out on the easiest money they ever could have made on a quiet Sunday afternoon and instead left a lot of sad faced people deviled-eggless.
Most in the service industry bend over backwards to make customers happy and I really do not think that the integrity of the place would have been compromised by walking some leftover eggs 2 blocks away.
I see no reason to come back to this place given that the food is generally oversalted and the front hostess is almost always rude if you dare to show up sans reservation, even if the place is quiet. I want to love this place because the vibe and the dÃ©cor are just plain awesome, but I cannot get over the hoity toity service and super rude hostess."212,4638,4639,1,"I just received this shirt.

We were promised the late fees on our previous loan would be paid by Low VA Rates which they never paid. We were told we would be receiving checks at the close of the loan for thousands of dollars which turned out to be only hundreds. Communication in general was poor at its best. During closing, cost were added to the loan and when we asked about said cost, Dan our Loan Officer bold faced lied what the cost was for. We had to call the title company to get the truth. Using Low VA Rates to refinance was the worst possible decision to make. I caution anyone who calls Low VA Rates to make sure you know what your are getting involved in. This company is not out to help veterans, taking your money is the only thing they care about. The loan I was offered was going to put my family further in debt by over $10,000.

Seems like I can access it on my Android, but nothing doing on computer. Some of my downloads are from the 60's, of mono quality, but the new software prevents you from adjusting the quality of the sound.
My biggest complaint is the constant BUFFERING. Songs begin playing and then just stop for no reason whatsoever. Customer service [again, agreeing with the masses that it's a total joke] told me to uninstall and reinstall new software. Still no stopping the buffering. I always use WiFi as an interface, as recommended by T-Mobile and Rhapsody customer service. I also have a WiFi hot spot on my smart phone so I can get apps, etc. when traveling through zones with poor WiFi service. Rhapsody still buffers! The only way around this is to access libraries you've permanently downloaded onto your sim card.
And finally, apparently the new software allows you to queue up to three playlists for your constant listening pleasure, but you can't pick and choose within the libraries which songs you wish to hear, and which you wish to skip. If you queue up the playlist, you're stuck with all of them. And, in the case of a long road trip where you might want to listen to the random song mixer, no such doing on the smartphone app.
I'm tired of being billed for poor customer service, software that keeps changing, an obvious push into streaming music and unradio application, and an obvious sham/scam when it comes to previously downloaded, paid-for music, that's no longer available. Can someone say ""theft""????"222,3479,3480,2,"These cards are printed on the absolute worst card stock I have ever seen/felt. It is one step above paper.

And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:-- its heavy-- its noisy - scares both my dogs. The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.-- battery charge didn't last long.Second, when it didn't run:-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall. It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times. I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"". Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing. No light, nada.So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?The answer was disappointing too. No idea. You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.

I've tried the Microsoft Diagnostics tool for Surface Pro but it just stops right in the middle of the scan. Remember, it won't stay on for more than 10 to 15 minutes and mos repair tools take longer than that. Also tried a repair where it reinstalled Windows. It quit at the very end.

The very first day, I received a phone call saying that he had a small cut under his eye and it was also stated that he played with other dogs. My dog is not supposed to play with other dogs because he is not neutered. So, failure #1: apparently they did not read his records and failure #2: what was going on that he received a cut under his eye. They did ask if I wanted to take him to Banfield Hospital located in PetSmart, but I told them to watch him over the next couple of days. Of course they tried to say the cut wasn't bad to save themselves. At that point, I couldn't do much because I was on my way out of town. I called back the next day to check on him. I was told he was very snappy so the staff didn't have a chance to take him out. Failure #3, this is an eight pound, small dog who can't do anything but bark.
No one has ever complained about taking him out for a walk because he is snappy. I also wanted my dog to have a bath when I picked him up. When I get to the hotel at 7:30 AM, I was told my dog did not have a bath because ""he didn't like them very much"". They also had the nerve to say, this must be his first time here. Okay, itÂ’s clear they don't pay attention to the records at all because they would have seen that he has been to this particular PetSmart Hotel before and I never had issues like this.

After soaking the stone for more than 20 minutes I began to attempt to sharpen. The fine side of this stone was rated 6000. It seemed like soap. The stone quickly wore down and my blade would dig into the stone if I turned my edge. The stone became pastelike. (Unlike the paste I've developed on oil or other water stones.) I really wanted to like this due to the overwhelming reviews so I cleaned the stone and walked away. Two days later I just now attempted to sharpen the same knife. Ive been attempting to rotate the stone not to wear down one spot and still the stone is almost mushy.

I purchased a rug that cost roughly $800-900. The rug was not available at the time and so I needed to wait a few weeks to pick it up at a warehouse.

I ordered it at the 3rd to last week in November, and was told that I could pick it up Mid-December. I called Mid-December, and was told that it was back ordered until the end of December. I called again some time later (after finally reaching a customer service representative 40 mins later ""due to high call volume"" - also a recurring theme anytime you call) and was told that that my payment method was no longer valid even though they had charged me for half of the payment already. After confirming my payment method the customer service rep stated that she would call back that day when the payment was finalized and I could set up an appointment to receive to pick up my rug. She never called back and after trying to call 2 more times, in which I couldn't get a customer service rep for over 30 mins each, I decided to hang up and wait to HOPEFULLY hear from this company. I did not hear from them, but did see that payment went through and inversely returned to me. I called to see why my payment had been returned to me and they simply stated that the order had been back ordered until Mid-January, in which I responded to have them return my full payment because I was not dealing with it anymore.

How can that be when I clicked on that item and the quantity I wanted and checked out with it, be out of stock?! Clearly that's false advertising not to mention I didn't even get an email saying that the item was unavailable but charged my credit card!

During this time I moved to CA and attempted to cancel this credit card and lost track of this acct. Yahoo Music then charged me for another year of this service (phone # 800-318-0631) at 2x the original price or $119.88 for another year of service with no prior notification to me. When I called to request a refund since I no longer want the service and did not agree to paying 2x the original price they refused to refund my account. They only agreed to lower the status of my account from sharing music to only listening to music on my pc for $60 per year with an additional $1 per burning a CD. This downgraded service would be of no use to me since I could no longer share songs on my MP3 player. When I called Yahoo Music (1-800-318-0631) they said it was company policy to not refund their customers even in the case they change their price without prior notification. I believe their business practice is deceitful and would appreciate your assistance in this matter.

NO, it's NOT a masterpiece. Not by a long shot. Yes the game is beautifully rendered and realistic but at the same time, it's bleak and barren; yes I suppose there's a lot of quests to do but so far they're VERY repetitive. I've played about 15 hours so far and it took forever to get through the intro and the main tutorials. The story so far is really a snooze fest and I'm having a hard time feeling any bonding with any characters and any drive to continue this story. There are way too many cut scenes and dialogues are way too long and just meaningless fluff.I agree with many who say the map is just massive... but this is not a good thing like it is in Witcher 3: Wildhunt or God of War or Horizon: Zero Dawn. It literally takes forever to get from one main story interaction to another on your horse. In between is a beautiful landscape but completely void of anything interesting which makes it tedious. Yes there are some side quests to find and places to discover off the main route but from what I've experienced so far a LOT of the map is simply nothing... just pretty landscape.Yes, I realize I've only played about 15 hours but that's more than enough time for a game to grab my attention, get me interested in the game, the story, the controls and gameplay and start to have emotional investment in it AND especially the characters. RDR2 does none of that and I frankly don't want to wait around to see if that happens.I've decided there exists a massive disconnect with these so-called ""critics"" and actual, TRUE gamers definition of a ""masterpiece"" gaming experience. For critics it appears... especially with RDR2... all they seem to care about is a beautiful, realistic landscape, anticipation with waiting years for a previously fantastic game to come out with a sequel and more story and cut scenes than actual game play. This is more like an interactive movie, not a game. I've concluded either Rockstar paid off a LOT of reviewers to give RDR2 10/10 ratings or most of them simply aren't true gamers and don't fully understand what most gamers want and respect out of a game and what really constitutes a masterpiece. Sorry but a beautiful landscape that looks absolutely real isn't enough to give a game a great score. Games have been rendered amazingly realistic for years now and it's almost expected. This seems to be the main accolade for most of the reviews I've read online.You know what an RPG Masterpiece is? God of War. Horizon: Zero Dawn. And what I consider to be the best game ever made: The Witcher 3, Wild Hunt. The Witcher has a massive map and sometimes takes you a while to get from one quest point to another but in between is not only the most realistic landscape you can imagine but stuff to explore and discover at every step of the way, under every rock and behind every bush. Not only that, CD Projekt Red was somehow able to create the most dynamic and LIVE world I've ever seen in a game. Cities are flowing with real side interactions, voices, sounds and animations. I sometimes think the sounds in the game are coming from outside my house. The towns, cities and open space in The Witcher 3 is ALIVE... more alive than any game I've ever played. RDR2 doesn't even come close. Hell, I liked Assassin's Creed: Origins way better than this borefest.I'm giving this game one star because the review of it here on Amazon should reflect what the game is really like and because it is NOTHING like what so many critics are saying. It's honestly a 6/10 for me. I doubt I'll even finish it. I'd rather get Assassin's Creed: Odyssey or Spiderman with my limited available gaming time. I'm just glad I didn't get the Special or Ultimate editions."251,3166,3167,0,"I was first introduced to From games at Demons Souls' launch. It totally clicked with me, and I've followed all their releases since. I had a lot of anticipation for this one, and while some of the game is deeply engrossing and the world is amazing, Sekiro's broken and rigid combat and boss system overshadows and destroys whatever accomplishments the rest of the game makes.Timing and attack animations are often poor. Deflect and jump, two of your three key combat defenses, are off timing on key mini-bosses and bosses. Enemy animations do not match up with collision.There are multiple bosses that require an hour or two of attempts. At the point you beat them, it's not a great feeling of accomplishment as the cliche goes. Just resentment that From repeatedly puts such cockblocks in what would otherwise be a perfect game.This is the only video game I can ever remember not finishing, that I wanted to finish. Sword Saint is ridiculous. No bigger feeling of disappointment in a game in putting 40 hours in and not being able to finish it."252,1425,1426,1,William and his other moderators ruined the site with their constant meddling in discussions.

Â I called him a day later since he never called me back and he said that he watched the video and it did NOT go missing by his guys.Â I drove to the shop to speak to him directly and he half-assed and walk through the lost and found box to pull out some broken and $1 glasses to show me. Â Obviously, you are not going to leave a $500 pair of brand new glasses in the lost and found.Â i will add that I left a box of Kleenex, a can of gum in the same compartment as the glasses and those also were not put back into my car.Â Anyways, it's entirely my fault for not taking out all of my valuable belongings out of the car before leaving it at Parkview.Â I will lastly add that while I showed up the last time to speak to Johnny, a cop car pulls up asking to speak to an employee.Â Unless you are there with your car while it is getting cleaned or take out every valuable thing in the car, do not come here.PERIOD."256,3113,3114,1,"1 star is a little harsh, as gameplay can be semi enjoyable at moments. But the makers have done so much to ruin a once great fanchise, that the end result feels like they did EVERYTHING they could to extract the good elements, while simultaneously injecting trash throughout the game.The plot has always been a bit vague, but it's clear now that it has no particular direction. None of the dialogue is necessary, and it takes forever to sit through. There is no option to speed it up or skip a line, so I simply have to skip entire scenes at this point, to stop wasting my time on development within the Disney worlds, where we already know the story. I want to see plot development on the world of Kingdom Hearts, which is nonexistent.Additionally, I have yet to see any final fantasy characters. Even if a couple will come a little later, I'm over 20 hours in and have been denied the enjoyment of seeing any familiar faces. There is absolutely no relevant character development. As the plot refuses to move forward, so do all the characters stories.The combat system is the worst. It is overwhelmed with a ton of cutscene, enemy mowing specials, that take away the challenge, and makes the player wonder why this game wasn't a movie, since all of the combat is being watched in a cutscene, instead of played out by the gamer.No more forms, not in the way we once knew them. You run into combat, button mash an enemy for 10 seconds, and now you can access an uninteresting form, that at best, is a shadow of one of the old forms, or at worst, was dreamt up by this new team that completely lacks creative direction. The form accessed by your default keyblade is the only way I've been able to see some of my favorite combo finishers from kingdom hearts 2. Default form is unintersting.Combat is over-saturated with team combos, special finishing moves that become available once you attack a marked enemy, a special ability to shoot enemies with 24 rays of light, summons that do damage but also top off everyone's health, and useless dashing combos that can be used to use a special combo by jumping off a wall, but bad camera angles mean you'll almost never be able to accurately aim at anything.Do yourself a favor and buy a remake of Kingdom Hearts 2, and avoid this disappointment at all costs!"257,780,781,2,"I just purchased a 250cc road warrior trike. from Great Sports Inc. now when I purchased the trike I expected all of what they was advertising on the picture I have seen. but I didnÂ’t get what they was advertising. the bike had chrome rail, a reverse gear and a oil check stick.

In the winter time it feels like there is no heat on whatsoever, so after you finish a workout - if you're at all sweaty you're going to get an instant chill.Â -One elevator. Most people here take the stairs to go between the floors, and nothing is just on one floor. The staircases are not heated, which also contributes to the chills.Â -It's awkward. Not only is there no music playing in the background of any room in the YMCA, but it's fairly silent in the workout rooms. Some music might help cut the tension.Â -Not many spin classes.Â -For weightlifters. The weightlifting room upstairs isn't large enough to house the capacity of it's customers. I work out in the days and at non-peak hours, and still have trouble getting a machine. People are always waiting.Â -Sauna. This is the same for the sauna. It seats about 5 people comfortably, but generally we have people standing up waiting for another person to leave the seated position.

On her website she represents that you will receive a free IPOD for conducting a survey and states that it really works. What she doesn't tell you is that the survey is very, very long and is comprised of other advertisers asking questions about likes, dislikes, etc. The real problem lies in buying some of these advertisers products. The first page of the survey states you need to buy 3 of the products advertised on that page (which is extensive). If you do that, the survey moves to the next page and guess what... you have to buy three more items. By the time you figure out that this is really unscrupulous business practice, you have already purchased 3 gimmicky items and there is no turning back.

The shoes were ranked as the top shoe for nurses and was excited to try them out. When them came I was a little surprised how they were made (all one piece, no moveable tongue). They fit well but were a little wider than I expected. I have now had them since the beginning of January and at the end of March while lacing them up they broke. The eyelet completely broke which is supposed to be made of shoe fabric as well. I have only worn these for work and nothing else. I also always untie them instead of sliding them off. I was not expecting the cost of the shoe to end up being poorly made. So buyers.....beware."279,3864,3865,1,"When you receive this computer, there is a note from MSI explaining that if you review this item as 5-stars on Amazon, they will send a free pair of $100 headphones. At this point, I felt like I had been tricked. The computer's hardware is decent, but the materials are poor. I had a Dell XPS 15, and it was nowhere close to that level in terms of build and materials.The screen is surprisingly poor. I constantly had to adjust the angle because it is constantly ""washed out."" It is a difference of only a few degrees, and even changing seating position would wash out the screen.But the biggest issue, and why I am only able to give it one star, is that is crashed twice on me within weeks of getting the computer. I did research online and this seems to be a very common issue with these computers, and with MSI laptops in general. Twice all of my files were removed. It took hours to restore to factory default settings, and it crashed once again days later. This is completely unacceptable for any computer to have this recurring issue, let alone a mid-tier performance gaming laptop."280,1449,1450,2,"We signed up for multiple products (a yr ago) all on automatic draft and free shipping for every order.

It comes with a decent case that I will repurpose for another pair of glasses I have that I care far more about than these. For those who say what did you expect for 16, I would say, not a 5 pair of glasses that tare far from premium and should never be confused with military anything.

They ordered it again and indicated it would take a week so it would be ready by the end of the following week. I waited three days after they said it would be ready and guess what...still nothing. I asked to speak directly to the escrow department but was told they donÂ’t talk to customers but he would send them an email (really an email...wouldnÂ’t calling be faster I said, but his response was their procedure is to follow up with an email). He said he would ask them to expedite it so I should have something in less than a week. Ridiculous! ItÂ’s like pulling teeth to get this one thing done. IÂ’ve had other experiences with them that left me feeling like a very unsatisfied customer. I canÂ’t wait to payoff the loan and not have to deal with Planet Homelending Mortgage Company.

Your only option is to live chat or email. I decided to chat. I waited 45 minutes to get someone. I was then told to use a link that was broken. After explaining the link didn't work, they sent me another link that then disconnected me.
I went back thru the process to live chat and this time waited over an hour before getting an advisor. I was told I needed to submit screenshots of 3 things, which I did. The person spoke terrible English and told me that I had cropped the images, which I hadn't. I did a print screen and pasted them into word. The transaction in question was right at the top. After submitting screenshots in paint instead I was told that my case could not be fixed because the submissions were invalid. I did exactly what they told me to do, but she or he couldn't tell me exactly what to do because they didn't understand what I was saying. They then said, ""Let us know if there is anything else we can help you with."" Umm you didn't fix anything.
I then decided to go the email route in which I attached all the necessary information. When they responded they said (in poor English) that they understood that I had lost coins and never received my player. NOT WHAT MY PROBLEM WAS! They then proceeded to tell me that due to the level of work needed to investigate I risked losing my account if they found it to be fraudulent. Considering my user name and the information about my case was inaccurate, I had zero faith in pursuing the matter as I may lose the hundreds of dollars I had put into the game over their incompetence.

I could not believe I was not made aware of this until I made contact, we would have turned up to a hotel in a different country just to be turned away after a very long journey.
Initially they told us the hotel was fully booked and then another member of staff told me there was a room available but at a higher cost (which they told me I would have to pay!).
After 3 long days of calling this company being put on hold, being fed lies, telling me no managers were in and then another telling me there were 2 available to speak to me 10 minutes later!!
If this was put right before then I would have been happy but they were not even trying to make this right and just expected me to go and find another hotel myself just 2 days before my flight!

Only the Amazon pads leaked. (and i used more than one box of them)Original review: I have a cat that is urinating outside the litter box, and i use these pads to catch the urine. i have them positoned flat on the floor and also draped under the entrance to the litter box, under her entrance ramp. She is only 10 lbs and she urinates many times/day, so please note, this is not a large amount of urine, and it forms only a small to medium sized circle on the pad (it never fills the whole pad). My experience is that everything written in the product description is not true:- ""Each pad comes with five layers to ensure leak-proof performance."" My experience: these pads are super thin. I have examined them carefully and I don't see how they could have 5 layers.- ""The anti-streaming top layer offers a quick-drying quilted surface that locks in wetness, reduces odor, and prevents tracking."" My experience:when my cat urinates on the pads i drape around the litter box entrance, the urine runs off instead of being absorbed. When she urinates on the pad that is flat on the floor, it seeps through the plastic and gets the floor wet. If she steps on a urine soaked pad, she tracks it onto the floor.- ""The surge layer keeps liquid flowing in the right direction, while the sponge-like core provides maximum absorption and turns liquid into gel upon contact. "" This truly makes me laugh. There is no sponge-like core or gel action. The urine remains liquid, is not absorbed well by the pad, leaks out of the pad, and is easily tracked onto the floor when the cat steps on it.- "" The last two layers of the leak-proof pet-training pads--the locking layer and the protective plastic lining--keep floors safe from damage."" My experience is that they leak every single time."317,3997,3998,1,"I was aware that AmazonBasics batteries would not be as durable as more costly batteries and I have used these in various devices over the last year.. However, I did not expect a leak which damaged a remote control blind valued at $1000. The AA battery was one of 36 required to power 3 large Hunter Douglas fabric blinds. Less than 2 weeks after the annual battery replacement, I found that a black liquid was oozing from one of the battery holders, downward onto the blind, visible from both inside and from the patio outside. I removed all 12 batteries which were all dripping the liquid (acid??). We don't know yet if any of this can be professionally cleaned and at what cost. Worse yet, the mess permanently dulled a large granite island nearby while cleaning the batteries and my hands. The Amazon chat representative approved a refund for defective batteries and a $50 policy credit. Conclusion: these are very inexpensive, low to medium quality batteries. Do not use them for any purpose or devices where leaks would be a concern."318,2326,2327,0,"Honestly not a good retailer.

I wanted to have a way to get to know the cards and really know their meaning .This sounded like a great book.HOWEVER, the author has a lot of attitude. He's very much opposed to non-RWS decks. They seem to be an affront to him. This attitude comes through very plainly (My husband and I have a multitude of decks, and not a one is the RWS). Sure, he recommends a few non-RWS decks, but the decks he recommends are very faithful to the RWS. So, starting on page 1 the man annoyed me.""The Halloween Tarot is one of the few rare exceptions to the (general) rule that any modern Tarot deck will usually sacrifice a lot of traditional interpretation or divinitory detail for artistic license""""Decks such as the Antichi Tarocchi Bolognesi, the Lombardy, or any of the Marseilles variations are, of course, 'historically older' and therefore, fundamentally 'more correct' (if you are into the whole fundamentalist movement thing), but in reality they leave a lot to be desired. They are fun to own and show off at parties, but when you need a quick and dirty reading on the local gossip, you will more likely find yourself grabbing one of the Waite decks.""Now, I'm not a Marseilles reader -- but that doesn't meant that there are not people for whom this is the preferred. I also don't personally care for pip decks.I was already on edge with this man before I finished page one. These are both from that page.Then I got to page 16 when he says this: ""A quick note on 'Pentacles.' No matter what your deck calls them, see them as gold coins not religious or magical symbols. The seditious act of changing coins into pentacles in the circles of the suit of Coins was a whim of an artist long ago that detracts from the meaning of the suit, which is 'money.' Instead they look like wooden pagan symbols painted yellow, which makes the interpretations needlessly confusing and counterintuitive. Adding 'stars' to the suit of Coins has served no purpose except to confuse and intimidate the public, and of course to enrage conservative Christian sects in the twentieth century (which is always fun).""By the time I was done with this page, I was done with Dusty.

I worked with them for a month total before ending the project. There were many errors throughout the beginning stages of development but I was patient because I didn't expect a lot of skill for the price I was paying.
Before work began I had negotiated the contractÂ with Piyal and was offered what I felt was a great price for the work I needed done. After telling Piyal I wanted to hire me he proceeded to tell me to hire his company through a different profile that didn't have any feedback. This seemed kind of fishy to me because the only reason I wanted to work with his profile was because he had feedback and I felt the chances of me being scammed were slimmer on an account that had spent so much time building up feedback. I denied Piyal's request to hire the different profile and started the contract with him and began working with a member of his company through email. This persons name was Gourav.
The work from Gourav was acceptable at first even though there were some pretty big errors and misconfigurations up until the project phase #3. At that point I had received an email saying that the ""(Search stores by Radius /Closest Stores + Product List + Cart + Checkout)"" but none of those features really worked right.
There was nowhere for me to put what the stores were in the admin panel so no way for the customer to actually find the store and nothing seemed to happen when clicking the submit button.
There was no Cart in the menu and that's what users would need the option of seeing so that they can checkout.
Once you got to checkout there was no way to actually pay. I said I had wanted it setup like as a delivery service delivery service that accepted cash only and there was no way to pay with this method or any at checkout.
When it came to users being able to enter their address to get it shipped to them there was only a handful of states there, and when selecting your state the city's menu would only show a few cities and was missing a lot.
There were other errors to but these were the main one's.
I pointed these errors out and wasn't receiving a response so I decided since nothing that was supposed to be delivered in Phase #3 was actually done or working, and there were still 2 more Phases to go and now we were getting done with the actual functionality aspects of the website that I would be unsatisfied with the work based on what he was giving me.
He emailed and said that he had forgotten to upload some parts of the code and that he would have it uploaded Monday and I told him no thanks I didn't want to work with him anymore. To me that sounded like a lie because it only takes 5 minutes to actually upload code. He messaged me again Tuesday saying he had completed Phase 3 and I said I had canceled his contract and was done working with him.
He said he had completed 80% of the work but I pointed out that so far everything was simple and now that we were actually getting into functionality it seemed sloppy and I didn't want to keep paying for something I'd have to pay someone else to fix when it's done.
That was the last time I spoke with him and it seemed like I was going to get my refund back until Piyal disputed it at the last hour. From there I began the Upwork dispute resolution process. I was contacted by ""Sam"" from Infoway via email and was asked for clarification about what happened and was told they wanted to offer me a refund. I responded with everything that had happened in detail and didn't hear anything back for a few day. The next email I was told he couldn't reply because he was in the hospital for some reason and that he would like to compensate me by offering my 3 month's of free service management.
To this I told him I had already decided to cease doing business with his company and that I had already had my website completed by another company. He started going on about how I never gave them a chance and it was because of my ""perfectionist ideology"" but that they would refund the last phases milestone. I had to agree to change my feedback in order to get the refund though. Finally at the last hour before we were supposed to go on our call with the Upwork mediator I was contacted by Piyal and told they were going to refund the milestone.

It was completed start to finish in about 3 weeks which was very good, however before the fourth week was completed, my loan was sold to PennyMac without a hint that this could even happen.Â So much for the lie that JG Wentworth services it's own loans and my loan would never be sold. I googled PennyMac and found they had a terrible reputation. So now I'm stuck with PennyMac for 30 years or until they decide to sell my loan. So much for my due diligence on JG Wentworth. I asked this question, ""Do you sell your loans?"" The answer was. ""No, we do not sell our loans and we service the loans we make.""I was very uncomfortable with all the personal information that JG Wentworth required, but they said that due to Dodd/Frank all this personal information was required and that they would keep it secure because they will be my mortgage company for the next 30 years. Well as it turned out, I never made one payment to JG Wentworth. They sold my loan within less than a week after closing and I was never informed that possibility even existed until after the fact.Tell me, how could I ever believe anything I am told by JG Wentworth?

Here is my story:Â A particular marking ink our store carries was discontinued in January, thus were on the quest for any backstock we could find and Google led us to Ace Depot. Their site showed an abundance of stock so we placed an order for 99 units on 2/18/19. Our payment was processed and we waited for a shipment email. After three-plus weeks, I contacted Ace Depot on 3/11 and enquired about the shipment. They informed me they were waiting for a restock and our order would ship 3/20.During this time, I also made contact with the manufacturer of the ink who informed us they had no record of Ace Depot nor were any companies expecting a restock of the formula as it was COMPLETELY and permanently sold out. We thought it rather fishy that the manufacturer and AD would have such different information, so my coworker called AD anonymously on 3/12 and enquired about the product. ACE DEPOT LIED and claimed they DID have the product in stock and could ship to her same day, DESPITE THE FACT WE HAD BEEN TOLD THEY HAD NO STOCK. I emailed them about the conflicting information 3/12, they responded 3/13 and claimed the other rep had been misinformed and they were still waiting for a restock.Â I should have canceled the order then and there but I am evidently gullible and colorblind to red flags.Â On 3/27 our order had still not shipped. I emailed them again. On 3/28 they responded and said they had only received stock of a different color and asked if it would work for us. I responded and asked about whether or not they were going to receive the color we needed. THEY DID NOT RESPOND UNTIL 4/15! If you are keeping track, that is nearly two months from the beginning of the order and the initial charge to our card.Â I called, furious, on 4/17. They promised they were rush shipping our order and that if it did not arrive by 4/22 they would issue a full refund. Sure enough, 4/22 came and went with no shipment. When I contacted them asking for a refund my request was IGNORED and they instead told me again they were ""waiting for a shipment."" It was then that I realized they were attempting to run out the clock on a potential chargeback via our AmEx. I called and emailed them again requesting a return before finally filing a chargeback that was, of course, successful via AmEx. I thought it was the end of the story until MAY 8th when they somehow charged our card AGAIN and sent a shipping confirmation.Â Again- now three months since the inital order PLUS they obviously kept our card on file without our consent. How could it get worse, you ask? WELL! The ""product"" finally arrive and instead of being the name brand, bottled and labeled ink it was PAINT! PAINT!!! Alcohol-based generic paint in squishy bottles with no toxicity information, ingredient list or warnings. NOT WHAT WE ORDERED AT ALL.The most amazing thing? They refuse to refund me unless we pay the return shipping ($$$) and on top of that they insist on charging a 25% restocking fee.Â Obviously, we called AmEx again.TO ACE DEPOT, as I said in my last email and in our phone conversations: send a shipping label, return the funds and take your stupid paint.

However, people should be aware of at least one feature that has not proven out, at least for me. They claim that you can add an SD card and format it for ""internal"" use as expanded internal memory. When I tried to do that the tablet immediately recognized the card insertion and asked whether to format it for internal or portable (removable, shareable) use. I chose the internal. The tablet began to format the card, but failed claiming that the new card was ""corrupted"". I tried with two other new cards including other brands and the result was the same. Fortunately I was able to reformat the cards on my desktop computer to save them. So I decided that it would be better to have them for at least the portable type and reinserted a card as portable. The tablet recognized and I chose portable formatting, which the tablet did in about a split second.
Later I tried to move some picture files onto the card to get some use out of it and when I tried the tablet complained that I could not do that until I pressed some Â“confirmÂ” button which does not exist. In other words even though I have added a 128 GB card, I am unable to use it. Additionally, with my old tablet I was able to get more utility out of it by adding a third party software called MLUSB, which gave me more access to the internal files on the tablet. For instance I can insert a USB thumb drive and read its contents and move files to or from it using MLUSB. But on the new Lenovo tablet they have somehow BLOCKED ALL ACCESS to those files and I can no longer add or copy or transfer files to or from a USB drive. The trend is taking control of my tablet out of my hands. Also, my old tablet had 8 GB of internal memory and new with no added software less than 4 GB was used.
The new Lenovo sounds great with 16 GB of internal memory, but with fewer programs installed off the top, more than half of the memory is already used up. In short, I like the physical apparatus, but not the software writer's philosophy. Also I notice that now almost every program is asking for permission to access everything, camera, phone photographs, microphone, contacts etc.Â "367,637,638,2,"The Health club charges a lot.

I agreed to do the after market system but they never disclosed to me that would ruin the sound system and the built in sub-woofers would not work. I have to spend $149 for an amphiphile to get them to work, which i did with my Visa off amazon and was quoted $250.00 to get this installed. As soon as they installed the new amp the built in subwoofer shorted the amp out and it burned up The built in subwoofers DO NOT WORK. II still had to pay the guys $250 to wire the car for the amp and still have no sound I now purchased a aftermarket base tube that cost me $320 and waiting for that to arrive to get it installed. The actual built in bass speakers that fit the car about sling used for $450. When they installed the aftermarket sound system/ navigation and wired it in they broke the center console lights and shipped me the car with those hanging down and the clips broken off. I have Tape holding this up. The vehicle had not been detailed or cleaned whatÂ’s so ever. There were blood stains, carpets were stained everywhere, doghair filled the door storage compartments. Most importantly the right rear door has a big crack through it that the salesperson said was not there before they sold me the vehicle. I have pictures of all this and sent them to the salesperson. The vehicle was for sale for over 3 months at this dealership that I am aware of from checking auto trader randomly. They told me they didnÂ’t have time to get the vehicle cleaned up before they shipped it to me. They priced the door out as did I and it is $2400 to replace the inside panel. I used my visa to detail the vehicle inside only for $65. I then had to bring the vehicle to a guy with special buffing compound to try to get all the oxidation off the plastic pieces around all the windows and used my Visa for $50. The ready windshield wiper blade was half hanging down from the vehicle and had to replace that as well $10..The salesperson verbally agreed to fill the vehicle in gas before they shipped it to me because the last vehicle I purchased from them, they sent dead empty. This one they also sent dead empty. i used my visa and filled it up for $89. While driving the vehicle, if you let go of the steering wheel it would rip you right off the road. The alignment was way off and the tires had not been rotated and had huge indentions assisting in pulling you off the road. Tires Plus in Boca Raton did the work and reported that this vehicle had not been properly serviced and will need new tires to correct the issue because those were ruined. I payed for a alignment with my Visa $131Â… I have repeatedly called the dealership since the vehicle got delivered on July 12th around 12:30pm. As soon as the vehicle came off the truck I made my first hone cal. I have called 12 times since and got the same answer that they were working on it and trying to get a hold of the owner and would call me back. They never called me back. The last time I called July 26 at 2:30pm and spoke with Jason the Sales manager he told me the owner is done with me and to go ahead and do what I have to do because they are to helping me with anything. The salesman Jacob and Sales manager Jason agreed that they were responsible for a lot of these issues and they should have never sent me the vehicle this way. Jacob also said that they never got to see the vehicle before it was shipped because it came right from the audio shop and on the truck. As a repeat customer and being very satisfied with my first purchase I was hoping for a better outcome and customer service with this one."384,3537,3538,0,"Headphone sound is good.

These are supposed to be utility pants. I shouldn't have to use a lint roller every time I wash them!

But it has a few serious design flaws.1) It has a strap at the back so you can attach it to another roller bag, but the wheels are so tall that it doesn't stack on top of other bags without making them so heavy they fall over.2) The bottom frame of the handle takes up a huge amount of room inside. It seems large enough to hold a ton of stuff, but on the inside the space is so chopped up by the frame that it's hard to pack things in it.3) The handle is so flimsy. It stuck about half the time I tried to extend it, and when it does extend it's floppy."389,4322,4323,0,"No one seems to mention that the tool will scratch a polished blade no matter how careful you are at using it. First. The guides guide as they are supposed to but the instructions say to make sure the knife is touching against the outside edge of the guide. When you do this you will find that it will scratch the outside edge of your blade opposite the edge being sharpened with horizontal scratch marks.This shows up pretty clearly on a polished blade. They should use Teflon or felt in these guides to prevent this. If you back the pressure off the outside edge you risk sanding or scratching not only the edge of the blade but also the side of the blade to be sharpened as well.I think all the reviews of this product have been paid for or overstated to sell the product. Sharpening lawn equipment fine. But sharpening quality knifes use the old method,a quality whetstone. I scratched a pretty good knife in the process. I will need to polish the scratches out with some extra work I had not planned on. If it's too good to be true then it probably is. Lesson learned.Pros: Amazon shipped order super fast.Cons: Do not use this sharpener on quality knives or polished knives if you are a collector."390,4090,4091,0,I subscribed to these because they are slightly cheaper than similar ones at Walmart from a cheaper brand and they work decently but they can't hold much weight. Basically everything I put on it other than very lightweight items (such as bacon/scrambled eggs) causes the plates to bend and snap. I didn't expect them to handle really heavy items but I can barely use them for hamburger helper or even add grits to my plate for breakfast. They handle liquidy foods pretty well though.Not sure if I will continue my subscription because I'm only saving $1-2 I think and I definitely prefer Walmarts brand.391,487,488,2,I bought a car from Car Hop because I was desperate.

The diamond coating makes a huge difference in how fast you can sharpen knives. The reason I give this such a low rating is the quality sucks. After using this to sharpen 5 or 6 knives I noticed the thing stopped working. I got to looking and realized the diamond coating had come off. Smith's website said you will notice the coating come off during the first sharpening but that was normal it's like excess and was normal. It also said the diamond coating was permanently bonded to the sharpener but in my case this is not true. If Smith can find a way to keep the diamond coating to stay on this would be one of my favorite field sharpening hones. Until they come out with a better way to bond the diamonds do not buy this, instead buy the workshop field sharpener.

They are good quality tools. But this sharpener has no control to it. The carbide is extremely sharp and will remove material from just about any tool you have. The problem is the small amount of surface area in contact with the edge being sharpend. This allows for gouging to occur even with the slightest pressure. I ruined two pairs of scissors and had to spend an hour with my honing stones to repair the edge on my pruner.Corona should be ashamed to place their name on this tool. The only reason I can see for doing so, is that their competitors sell the same style sharpener. So, Corona is just trying to get you to spend that little bit extra of your hard earned money. Save your cash and stick with your honing stones."399,2586,2587,0,"This magazine was a very big disappointment. It is basically adds with a couple recipes thrown in.

Then to top it off, they constantly slide out! ItÂ’s really annoying and I just donÂ’t get why they made it like that, the original version didnÂ’t have this issue at all. My other complaint, like others have mentioned, is the way they have portrayed the minorities. IÂ’m glad they added more women and diversity, but they went about it all wrong. The black characters are very unrealistic and to be frank, pretty offensive the way they are portrayed. IÂ’m really disappointed in the remake, if I knew about either of these issues prior, I wouldnÂ’t have supported the company by buying this product. IÂ’d actually rather have the old version. Very disappointed and frustrated. TheyÂ’ve taken a great game and childhood memory I wanted to share with my kids, and essentially ruined it.

In other words, in order to take advantage of free shipping, I would have to place an order during one of these periods. I cancelled my order.

Â Unfortunately, my previous pass had expired but I was intending on renewing. Â The guy ""working"" the front, (Daniel) would not let me pay for a new pass because he was not authorized to do so.

Â He refused that suggestion as well and told me to leave.Â Technically, he was doing his Job, but there is some grey area here. Â He could have recognized that I've paid my dues in the past and I had money in hand willing to pay for another membership.

Â And I'm leaning in the direction of avoiding cell phone and other contracts as much as possible. Â Other than guaranteeing the gym owner some financial security, I don't see how a membership benefits me at all. Â So, I'm grateful they offer $50/month memberships without commitment.Cons:1) Cleanliness: My main issue with this gym is that it's a bit dirty. There never seems to be enough spray bottles to clean the machines with. Â During cold and flu season especially, good sanitation is very important. Â It's difficult to keep the equipment clean if the bottles are always missing or empty. Â I have asked Â the employees (who seem overly busy checking their hotmail) Â almost every time I go, and they'll refill them when asked, but otherwise never. Â I've also talked to management about it, but it's still not done well.Â 2) Lack of Washrooms: Â Only one washroom for men, one for women. Â When the gym is busy, there can easily be upto 20+ people working out. This might not seem like a big deal, but when I work out I like to drink alot of water. Â I think having only one (filthy) toilet for each change room is totally inadequate.3) Not enough Cardio equipment: Â They have four treadmills, which are almost always busy. Â Maybe 10 elliptical machines. Â A few bikes. Â If I ever opened a gym, I would have at least 60% of the space filled with cardio and maybe 40% weights. Â This place is more like 75% weights 25% cardio.Overall impression:This is not the nicest gym I've been to by any stretch but it does serve a purpose. Â If they improved on the overall cleanliness and sanitation, as well as put in a bit more cardio equipment, this could be a great gym. The location is the best part for me as it's literally 2 minutes from my home. Â My biggest problem with working out in the past has always been 'getting there.' Â If you've worked all day, and then have to take a bus or something to get to the gym, it's easy to skip it and go straight home. Â But if the gym is near your home, you can go whenever you want.

If you have a stainless steel sink, squeeze out the suds onto a white dish or bowl so it's easier to see the contrast in color.This is my first experience with the blue dye, but it is enough to get me to find an alternative. It's becoming more frequent that I have to find alternatives to the ""major brands."" Their materials are getting cheaper and their concern for consumer safety is following suit."456,4139,4140,0,"The look of the case and the brand name is impressive to me and that's where the pros stop. As a business traveler this rolling case was not functional at all. The design does not keep the case upright with items in it. For instance if you have a laptop in the bag along with folders the bag will tip over if you do not place it close to a wall when you let it go to keep it upright. This is an impossible task if your zipping through an airport and try to do anything other than hold the case by the handle at all times to keep it from tipping over. Also the wheels have a terrible turn radius, it's nearly impossible to steer if the bag is full with items. You will truly get a great forearm workout if you try to maneuver the case on all four wheels.This bag will be useful if you never put anything inside it, and traveled with it totally empty. It's almost easier to just carry the case like a briefcase instead of trying to roll it. But then again, you could have just bought a briefcase or a backpack instead."457,339,340,1,"I wish I would have read these reviews before ordering a refrigerator and dishwasher from ABT Electronics because it took 4 1/2 months to get my brand-new Whirlpool Refrigerator working properly to where it didn't freeze everything that wasn't in a drawer. We threw out so much food and so MANY dozens of eggs it's ridiculous. Their service department stinks. They have grown too large to be able to keep happy customers and that was the ONLY reason I chose them. Five service calls and five replacement parts it took. Many promises to call me back and I'm still waiting for the service manager to call me back.
I truly believe if I didn't call back so many times I would not have a working refrigerator. The worst part is I didn't get any apologies, not even a gift card for the food I threw out. I had to send them videos and pictures to get them to believe me. On one service call they sent someone simply to take pictures of frozen food, even though I had already done it. I felt like they thought I was give them bull because I had stated I wanted a different fridge. I would never go back to them again.

I told my friend and she did not believe me and gave me some meal replacement. I was reluctant to take it but tried it again. After two days I was urinating blood and my hemorrhoids returned.

Latch is cheap plastic parts riveted together so it cannot be disassembled for repair. This gate is really cheesy, looks like cost cutting backfired. Gate is being returned to Amazon for credit. Lower plastic stop that keeps gate from swinging past frame keeps falling out of position and allowing gate to swing 180 degrees. It is a very poor substitute for the welded stop on our old gate. This cost reduced gate is unsafe, I expect much better for a child safety item.

At prime time, there is very little Â fresh air. There is a thick coating of dust on the backs of the TVs and some of the machines. The worst thing about this place is that a lot of the clients don't know proper gym etiquette. So often I see, usually males, sitting on machines for up half an hour while playing with their phones. There's a few obvious non bathers as well. People will stand behind you while you use a machine waiting for you to finish instead of either using something else or asking to work in.Â Worse, I had a huge drawn out incident with a jacked up male, who demanded I get off the leg extension, Â and who shouted Â ""I'll pull you off that machine if you don't get off it"". This pr--k also stood in front of the machine and jammed it with his legs with his crotch in my face so I couldn't use the machine. It was bad. He repeated this threat of physical violence again Â in front of an employee and the employee just stood there and did nothing, he was unable to behave in any way to diffuse the situation. Instead he gave some patronizing comments, all he was concerned about was swearing. The lack of response from the employees who have no capabilities or protocol to deal with overly aggressive males is very dangerous in any gym. If I had my phone with me, I would have called the police.Also odd is that no other gym members looked up from their workout to get involved or report what they had witnessed.There's better and safer places to work out in peace without dealing with out of control jacked up nutbars and useless employees. Even more obscene is that this pr--k was not banned from the gym and when I asked for a reimbursement from management, I was only given half the month back.Â The entire incident was obscene and I have never dealt with anything like this. It takes the ""community"" right out of community centre."471,3851,3852,0,"Rare that I right such a negative review.

This is highly sensationalized fantasy mocking history. There have been so many historical dramas that have been well written and directed. Some have worked hard at being as accurate as possible and others have taken liberties. But one thing they all tried hard to do was be believable. Being that this show is promoted as a historical docu-drama, the fantasy element is completely inappropriate, especially when there was no effort to even try to hold true to place names and events. All the magical nonsense depicted here and the horrible dialogue and directing made this series a major disappointment. Fantasy is great when it is not trying to imitate a historical drama and when the writing and directing are good. I hope this show gets cancelled bc it is not a docu-drama, it is fantasy. Had it been promoted as fantasy and the tribal and state players were represented by fictional names, I could give it at least 3 stars. I find it terrible that more people are not criticizing this shows gross misrepresentations of history.

Despite the item name, this is not a 3000/8000 grit combination stone. I tried using it to put a final polish on my chisels, which was after using 1200 grit sandpaper to hone the edge. This stone actually removed the polish put on by the sandpaper. Both sides produced a cloudy, uneven sheen, even after taking the time to flatten the stone (it was badly dished upon arrival), and further removing the first 1/8 inch of material.As well, both sides were prone to chipping and gouging from small impacts. At one point, the corner of the stone broke away when I took the rubber protector off.I will be e-mailing their customer service team in a few minutes to see if they have any idea what the issue is, and forwarding them this review. I will happily amend it if it turns out I was not using the stone correctly, but I honestly don't think that is the issue in this case.
