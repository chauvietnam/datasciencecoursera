1,2,"Reservation desk and General Manager Billy is incompetent. They are so rude, unprofessional and lie right to your face. There is a reason why they only allow you to make reservations on their website and you must pre-pay. When you miss your reservation due to emergency they just keep your money and... do not allow you to reserve another date unless you pay again. When I spoke to Billy the General Manager after speaking to the reservation manager, i felt like they were using a script. Very cold, very poor customer service, would never consider them again. They don’t care if you are a regular or if you have been there multiple times, means nothing. It's sad that the ownership allows incompetent people to handle their reservations. I would like an apology and would like a full refund!"
2,3,"I ordered an egg sandwich, which was not advertised by quantity of egg or additional items, but for $5 you would expect something that is more substantial than DRY Roll served with the worlds FLATTEST egg and you can’t even be sure it was 1 whole egg since it was scrambled and assembled behind the... counter. Prior to paying for my sandwich I wanted to check they put what i had asked, which they didn’t, instead of ham i received bacon, which equated to 1 slice since they only added half a slice per half of the sandwich. When they fixed my meal, what I saw was further disappointment where the slice could not even reach either end of the bread."
3,3,"I have called the business due to some complaints regarding drink issues and service issues. I have asked for refunds and they refused to do so and they never give me a reason. I have been very disappointed with this type of service I wish to have them give me a refund on all the times that I have... come to there business and there customer service is not very good they accuse you of asking for a ""Hand Out"" and I am very dissatisfied with this."
4,3,"Spent over an hour and a half yesterday 4 separate phone calls, over $20 never added to my card account. Spoke to candy of many reps each promising me a supervisor but got nothing. Called again today again, 10 minutes hold and nothing. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
5,3,"Customers earn free beverage/food rewards (1 star for every purchase). 12 stars, & you earn a Reward. These appear in their iPhone application, along with an expiration date. Rewards are good ON the expiration date. However, when the expiration rolls around, customers notice that their Reward... has magically disappeared before it was set to expire. This happened twice to me, and two mangers at my store (West Hollywood) were mystified and told me to report it to customer service. (it happened for the 2nd time today, 2/24). The first time,, the manager was apologetic and mystified. The second time, I spoke with the same manager, as well as a 2nd one. ""That isn't supposed to happen. Call customer service. Both times, they were apologetic & offered me a free drink as compensation. Fast forward to today 2/24, with it happening again. Call customer service. I called, but the rep said ""oh that's just the way the system is. She didn't care. I suggested they fix it. Nope. She said the reward was actually still there, but customer have to know to ASK for it. So if the customer doesn't know, they just see that it's disappeared & probably just walk away, not know they have to ASK special for it. By this time, I was speaking with a manager. How could they not want to fix it. Nope, nothing to fix., ""that's just the way it is,"" ""Nothing wrong. She said that managers KNOW about this. As on 1/16, and 2/24, they obviously don' ***** a big secret to the customers and I suspect that customers are just walking away from it. Then the manager said, oh they actually expire on the expiration date AT 2:30AM. So it literally expires the day BEFORE the expiration date? I pointed out that it felt like customers were being ripped off. They had to ASK for it, AND they fall off at 2am on the expiration date BEFORE they even open for business that day. The manager still wasn't interested. ""That's just the way it is."" Having been a customer since 1998, I hung up in disgust. Nice company."
6,3,"I have been a loyal customer of Starbucks for the past years, I have time and again received excellent service at Starbucks which is one of the main reasons I get my coffee there. I normally visit this Starbucks location regularly before going to work in the morning. The customer service, speed, and... coffee have been great. However, to my surprise everything changed on Thursday, 1/14/16 at 6:44am. I placed my order on the drive-threw and ordered a Venti White Mocha Frap with a Banana Nut Bread. My order was repeated again by the male employee before driving away to the window. When I arrived at the window, I was charged $7.50 then a few minutes later I get handed a Grande White Mocha Frap. I got very upset and told the employee that I ordered a VENTI not GRANDE. I noticed that one of the other male employees started laughing because my order was wrong. If I would’ve waited for my drink to be made again, I would’ve been late to work. I then, asked for my money back and that even took long. I'm very disappointed and disgusted with the way the two male employees representative Starbucks. Both were very rude, unprofessional and showed no sense of urgency. Not once did I receive an apology for the inconvenience. Very bad bossiness. Product_Or_Service."
7,3,"I want to share a negative experience about Starbucks located in County Road 220 Fleming Island, FL. The staff named Nisa was very rude to me. We had been waiting for our beverage for awhile on our table because we ordered pastry. I went up to check at the register and she said our drinks had been sitting there and that she already called us. Unfortunately, we did not hear our names called. We were sitting on the table closest to the register and she was aware our drinks had been sitting there and she knew where we were sitting yet she did not come over or called us. She also seemed upset and felt like I was interrupting with her work. I just wanted an apology instead I got a lecture about their Starbucks procedure that were responsible for getting our orders when our name was called and that she never once had to walk out and call the customers. It was our first time at that location and sadly our last. The manager Chelsea was there while Nisa was arguing with me and seemed to have no control of this employee. The manager however refunded our money and apologized. Nisa however walked out to the back room. I have contacted their district manager named Ralph M***** thru email but have not heard back yet. We dont like businesses like this in our neighborhood."
8,3,"At the Starbucks at 6365 Dobbin Rd in Columbia, one of two bathrooms have been out of service for about two months. This is unreasonably long. Doesn't Starbucks have a contractor/plumber who can repair the bathrooms in a reasonable time. People study and sit and drink beverages for a long time and may need to go to the 2nd bathroom if one is tied up. A secondary complaint is that this Starbucks has lot of flies in the place. Sometimes I have to leave and go home because of this."
9,3,"I went through the drive-thru may 5, 2017 at 05:30 and purchased a grande vanilla latte. The lady confirmed my order, confirmed the price of 4.15$. She ran my card and asked if I wanted a receipt. She didn't make eye contact and her voice wavered and I said yes, please. I would love a receipt. She fumbled around for a bit and then said there was a problem with her computer. She called the manager and I discovered she had charged me for a more expensive drink hoping I wouldn't need a receipt. They had to veto the charge and run my card again. Something shady is happening at this location and it's not okay."
10,3,"To whom it may concern: My Starbucks Gold reward card was lost, and I reported it online immediately. On September 26, 2016, I got an email confirmation from Starbucks with Order Number. I called twice regarding my replacement card and last week when I called, the representative told me that it should be ready to ship out in a couple of days. Today, Oct. 18, 2016, I called again, and another representative told me a different story. She said the card will not be ready for another two weeks due to the backup problem. I can not imagine getting a replacement card could be so difficult. I am really disappointed how Starbucks treat their customers."
11,3,"I am a long time customer of Hanna building Starbucks location and the experience I had today, much like most days was absolutely horrible. I waited in line as usual but when I got up to the register I witnessed the manager "" Jen "" be so rude to two customers. I believe both customers where homeless but had money for coffee. One of the gentlemen bought his coffee and another wanted some water. Jen began to yell very loud at the man that requested water telling him NO! The man just stood and looked at her and asked her why he couldn’t have water. Her response was please leave. When I approached the register to buy my coffee I asked the young lady ringing me up why that gentleman wasn't allowed to have water? she responded with we aren't allowed to give out water. I asked her kindly if I could buy him a cup of water because it was very hot outside she said she couldn't not do so. This young lady looked scared to answer me, and furthermore afraid to help the customer. My problem with this location is the manger! she is nasty and extremely rude to her staff and customers. I have to say as a women of color I feel she picks on African American customers and staff which makes me uncomfortable coming to this location. I have called the cooperate office but nothing seems to change, in fact I see a new face every time I am at that location. I will no longer visit that location based on the way ""Jen "" speakers to her staff. It's a shame because I truly enjoy the staff they are friendly and fast. This lady's behavior is rude and unacceptable and I will no longer shop at this location."
12,2,"I tried the Daily Harvest Subscription Service in September 2017 and was convinced I canceled my subscription right then. Apparently, I only put my orders on hold and found out this morning I was charged $48 for a delivery I did not authorize or asked for. I called the company and was told I didn't... skip so, therefore, they processed my order. I asked the customer service lady to cancel my order and refund me and she said she can not do this. I asked her why they don't let customers know about an upcoming order and she said they don't offer that service. I do not want this $48 box of smoothies. I still have 4 from the previous my freezer and do not like them at all) The company does not seem to have any interest in good customer service. At this point, I am considering refusing the shipment."
13,3,"On or about Sept, I signed up for food delivery service. I emailed the company later that day clearly requesting to not be placed on auto ship/auto pay. The website said “To cancel your subscription, click Edit Plan on the Plans tab to update your status or email. I chose the latter option, using the email address they provided to say that I did not want any future shipments. To ensure my request was received, I tried to call the company, but no phone number was listed on the website. In addition, the “Chat With Us” option on the website was disabled. I left the country the following day for a business trip. During this time, the company attempted to email me, saying that I should update my preferences via their website. This was confusing because I had already put my request for cancellation in writing via email, just as their instructions said to do. By the time I returned to the US and received their email, the company had already sent and charged me for a second shipment — despite my clearly written request not to do so. Perhaps more frustrating was the person I spoke with at the company, who seemed completely uninterested in resolving the situation to some degree of satisfaction."
14,1,"I received a sample box and didn’t care for it. The snacks were awful and in tiny amounts. It wasn’t worth the cost, so I cancelled my subscription & they charged me for another box anyway, but never sent the box and would not refund. This company is a total fraud."
15,3,"I ordered one (1) box of Gefen Gluten Free Matzo crackers online. Once I opened the box, I discovered they were all broken apart, quite badly. The reason, I believe, is because there was nothing inside the shipping/corrugated box to protect them, no bubble wrap or anything. So, I called the... company and spoke to whom I believe was the owner. Reluctantly, he agreed to ship me a replacement box. When it did not arrive, I called again and this time he implied that I was lying because all products are shipped with bubble wrap. He also thought that because I waited 3 weeks before calling to inform him of the broken crackers, that that, too, was indication that I was not being truthful. I explained that I did not immediately open the box of crackers because I did not need or want them yet as I had others to finish first. He was very angry, unprofessional and offensive. I too became angry because of his implications that I was lying, which I absolutely was not!! Now he refuses to send me a replacement box."
16,2,"After paying for all my groceries, security snatched my shopping bags on my way out, giving me some type of tag. I told him that I paid for everything, but he didn't listen to me, thinking that me and my husband were about to leave with the shopping cart. All the shopping carts are normally put near... the exit, so we just walked with it from cashier to the exit and wanted to put it there (this is not the first time we've been in this shop and we do every time, because we don't leave it just beside a cashier in the middle of the store!). Then security guy took away shopping bags from my husband, which surprised us, because no one has a right to take away ANY of the customer's belongings. My husband tried to take it back and was insulted by security. I called to the shop right away and ask for a manager. Manager saw the entire situation, but justified it, explaining that security guy was thinking we were leaving with the shopping cart. Even if he did so, he could have just told us about it and ask politely to return the cart (once again, we didn't leave the shop yet so the cart was inside). Manager also mentioned that we used obscenities in our native language, which actually was not related to any of the employees, but we were shocked by such service. This was the last time I went there. They sold not fresh food (and I did complain about that on ****, but no one seemed to care), which I returned. This is unappropriated behavior from security and unappropriated respond from the manager. They didn't apology for their mistake, they just defended the security, who think that he could just take away paid groceries from the customer. They put me in the position when I have to defend myself, and they do not regret what they did. This is shocking, never I saw anything in any store here."
17,1,"I bought Tastee Choice chicken parmesan in February for my family, it was nasty. Nobody liked it and it went to the disposal. The look and taste was both did not seem right. I called the company and they had a quality control man call me, he agreed it was not right by my description. I asked for a... refund and he kept trying to give me coupons for different products. I told him no, he said he would check into getting me refund and call me back, I still haven't heard from them. This is not the way a company should stand by their products. Do not buy the Tastee Choice product."
18,1,I had bought a Salsa from the company above listed through a merchant that refused to refund me and suggested I go through the manufacturer. I called many times to this Salsa company they don't answer there phone. Facebook is the other contact. There suppose to refund back haven't heard any response back from This vendor. The salsa bought was spoiled and molded. The store wasn't able to give me a refund or exchange. It was a total waste of my money buying this Salsa.
19,3,Missing items in order placed and charged forI have made five attempts via email and phone to contact this company regarding the items that are missing from my order. I finally got through to someone and they confirmed that they would ship out my missing items they also said they would send an email with this confirmation they did not email me a confirmation of the items being shipped they said it would arrive in three business days that was on Monday 11/16/15 it is now Thursday 11/19/15 today I made a sixth attempt to contact them with no response all I want is my missing items from my order my order number.
20,2,"The delivery time was completely wrong. The costumer service was completely lost. On 12/09 I ordered from the location at 9:55pm. Delivery time was suppose to be between 13-16pm. When I called the store at 10:48 the woman had a bad attitude. She told me to give them some more time. I did. At 11pm my co-worker whom orders with me called the store due to the fact that she was leaving. Spoke to the manager, the manager once again was very rude. I've never heard a manger curing out a costumer because she was asking to be reimburse for the time that had been wasted waiting on her food. The delivery driver finally arrived at 11:07 pm, Our food was cold, the delivery driver did not know I spoke creole and was talking smack about us to the manager over the phone. I've never seen such unprofessionalism in all my years of ordering from this company. We were disrespected, not reimbursed, and given food that was cold. She did not try in anyway to listen. I have pictures of the time the order said it was supposed to arrive, I have the time that the order was placed. I've never felt so disrespect in my life this way! "
21,1,"This business advertises as online food store, I place an order with them and never received the order, they card my credit card. I try to contact them and there was no resolution the woman who answered the phone was very unhelpful and didn't offer any resolution to the fact that I never received the order, she hang up on me. I called back and I asked for a supervisor and she stated she doesn't have a supervisor available for over 60 minutes that I was on hold. This company should is a scam. I lost my money and never got the order."
22,1,"I have been waiting on my trailer to be repaired since February 2016 and the owner Bruce hicks and wife michelle upon meeting were very polite and he seems to know what he was doing and promised us he would help us on a bad trailer repair from action trailer. We were behind a job they were doing for Hollywood police department and that was in February. I called in march and they said I was next, Well not only did they abandon the job which was my trailer to go to Georgia for a week, they never informed me of it and a month after that they moved without contacting with there move. I would of love being notified of the move so I can make a diction myself to let them to continue to work on my trailer or not. the move was far for me because I live in Miami and Davie was just right for me not commercial Blvd. he is very loud, disrespectful towards customers and make jokes like I had a Jamaican girlfriend one in front of his wife or who ever she more than once. PLEASE RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE CALLED THE FOOD TRUCK HEAVEN......HEAVEN IT IS NOT. THE WILL BE CALLING HIM SOON."
23,1,"African Americans not welcome. Bay State Food and Liquors should not be allowed to be open in Brookline. This store should get negative stars for their racist and discriminatory beliefs and actions. This is probably a great place to buy wine unless you are African American, this store treats African Americans like thieves and criminals. I had never been treated so poorly until this new ownership has come in. The people their don't even hide their racism as they are quite blatant in the way they follow and harass people of color once they enter the store. Two months ago I entered their store to buy some alcohol for friends that were coming into town for my wedding. the woman working their seemed unwilling or unable to answer my questions and she kept brushing me off. I started to walk to the back of the store to browse and I turned to see her pointing me out to two men that had just come out of some back room. The men proceeded to follow me the rest of the time I was in the store, never more than ten feet away. On Sunday, September the 27, 2015 my wife and I entered the store to purchase a bottle of wine to have with dinner and things went bad immediately. It ended with two people watching me from down two different aisles as I tried to shop. When I had had enough I confronted one of the men and asked him what his problem was with me and his response in extremely broken English was ""I work here, I can follow you if I want"" Fortunately my wife was there with me because she absolutely saved him from great bodily harm, high medical bills and the inability to eat solid food. I am surprised that the town of Brookline would allow a store to exist in its borders that treats a portion of the population so badly. All of my life I have dealt with racism, I didn't think that I would have to deal with it from people from a foreign country in the place I live and then to have people in the community support them. The owners of store are terrible people and it is my duty to let everyone know so that others and harassed and hurt by them."
24,3,"This Company does not provide the customer with enough information to reliably use their product, in this case, apricots. My large package was totally useless, which would not have h appended if I knew what they told me only after I called them about the spoiled product. Then they said (1) the product has a six-month shelf life; (2) should not be put into a refrigerator;(3) and they limit the time to request a replacement to five days - even though I received this package as a Christmas gift and placed it under the tree, to be opened nearly a month later. They washed their hands of the matter. They should provide more information with their product. Why a five-day window if the shelf life is six months?"
25,3,"On 12/08/17 I placed an order online for two packages of beef jerky, I paid $7 for shipping and handling, totaling $25, and I never received my order. I left several voicemail messages because when you call the customer service number, you are put on hold, and then directed to leave a message. I... also sent several emails explaining my issue, and no one has replied or tried to contact me. I have copies of all my emails sent and also records of my phone calls to Alien Jerky. I called the store directly once and left all my information, she said that she would forward my message to their online dept and I have not heard from anyone."
26,2,"I am very dissatisfied with the customer service that a high dollar, name brand company would have. I received a pair of Hunter Boots for Christmas, I would never personally purchase rain boots for over $100.00 especially since I live in Arizona, where It rarely rains. My friend got me these boots for a trip to Washington I was going on in late January. I did not receive my boots until Jan. 2 because we live in different states and that is when we saw each other for our gift exchange. When I opened my boots I of course tried them on with excitement, however the boots did not fit. I emailed Hunter boots explaining my issue with the fit of the boots and that I received them as a gift, so the online account they were purchased on would not match my name and that I wanted to exchange them for the Adjustable calf boots, which cost more, I am aware of that and willing to pay the difference. I did not receive a reply for 8 days, due to this delay in response I was already frustrated but was understanding due to high volume from the holidays. I got a response asking for multiple pictures of my product and I sent those over within 2 days. 8 more days go by until I receive another response from the company. The second response was from a different employee again asking for basically the same information I had just provided. My frustration level increased at this point due to the delay again and now I felt like I was not a valued customer because they did not care to even look into my issue, instead asked the same thing that was already asked. I provided the information again because I just wanted my problem resolved. 7 days later I receive an email from a 3rd employee confirming I am eligible for a like for like exchange, which is great, however that is not what I was asking for. At this point I would have expected them to tell me that I could not exchange my $150.00 boots for $160.00 boots, but I could just return my $150.00 boots for a refund and then buy the $160.00 boots. instead, I had to explain myself AGAIN and then I got a reply 3 days later, from a 4th employee, letting me know that the exchange could not be done and I would have to return my boots for a refund and asked for my order information, for the 3rd time. I provided the information requested and got a reply 2 days later saying my request could not be complete because I am not the person who purchased the boots. It is now Feb. 8, a month later, and I again had to explain that these boots were a gift and that I was just trying to get all this sorted out that they could refund the money to my friend after I sent the boots back. I finally got a return label and sent the boots back on Feb. 13. The refund finally was processed on February 27. I am shocked that a company that sells expensive products would have such a long turnaround time and lack of care for their customers. My refund process took 49 days, and 4 different employees to sort all of it out. I understand that my request for an exchange was not possible, but the lack of care, the huge delay, and the continuous run around was completely unnecessary. I am very disappointed in the customer service provided by this company and will not be purchasing anything from Hunter again."
27,1,"First of all, they kept advertising dates that a stock would come in. Several different times these dates would change. Their website directs you to leave an email address and they will notify you when the stock comes in. They did this for months. Then the day before an advertised order came in, it showed my size and boot available. Placed order and received confirmation. That night they must have somehow cancelled my order and instead of filling my order with the stock that came in the next day (and went) they just simply cancelled it. While I was email notified it was too late. I requested info and resolution several times. The offered me a discount and assured me the next order was coming in on 2/16. And to keep checking their website. which advertised daily that the next stock would come in 2/16. which on that day, it never did. I called right away and they would tell me nothing. not why it suddenly changed their website info, why my order was never filled, not why the stock never came in. The supervisor even lied to me and said keep checking thru out the day and they assured me not to look elsewhere, this was a new boot they were going to continue to make. checked all the rest of the day and nothing. now that boot is no longer offered at all. this is not only false advertising, it is bait and switch. trying to get you to keep coming to their website and luring with lies. I was cheated and wasted tons of my personal time."
28,3,"My husband purchased a pair of boots online for my birthday on 8/17. When I got them on my birthday (9/17), it was obvious that they were too big. I tried initiating a return online. I reached an order account page that stated my boots were eligible for return until 9/17. I attempted to process... a return. I was directed to a page to print out a return label, but the label never loaded, and I was unable to get to that page again. I tried contacting customer service by the email listed on the packing slip with no reply. There was still no reply, so I attempted their online chat. No one ever responded to the chat. I sent another email through the website form. I called the customer service line 2x, was hung up on the 1st time. I finally got a hold of a customer service rep, who told me after looking up my account that they couldn't return ""final sale"" items, despite the fact that the boots were never identified as final sale. I asked for the issue to be escalated. I was told I would be called back. I was never called back. I finally got a response by email from my website submitted attempt. I provided all of the above information. I was told that it was being assess. I finally just got an email back today after winding a follow up email saying that management said that they cannot accept returns of final sale items, but again, these boots were never listed as final sale at time of purchase."
29,3,"I ordered an item via the Club Monaco website. The item was delivered but in the wrong size. A size extra small instead of a large. Consequently, I called the Club Monaco customer service and explained the situation. I spoke to a very nice and super efficient customer service rep. She informed that... the item was no longer available in a size large online, but she would research brick & mortar stores to check availability of the item. The customer sales rep found several stores and decided the Soho, NY store would be the best option because they had 2 larges available and they close at 9PM. The rep called the store and briefed sales associate Reya relative to ordering and shipping the correct size from the Soho location. I called the store and spoke to Reya who referred to a male sales associate that supposedly who had more experience with shipping orders. Spoke with the male associate with the fake accent who had a very negative tone. Also due to his fake accent I was unable to understand what he was saying. I became very irritated. Therefore, he rudely stated that he would the manager. The manager was extremely rude as well with a very dismissive tone. It became quite obvious that I was dealing with people who has zero interest in helping me. I attempted to explain to the manager the problem even though the the customer service rep had explained to them my need. I was very firm with the manager who decided it would be better to fight with me rather than resolve a simple problem. I stated to the manager that I was going to submit a complaint to the corporate office and asked his name and the other male sales associate. He stated to me that he felt uncomfortable giving his name and refused to do so. I was very offended by this statement. I was was hanging up, the manager finally blurted out his name which is Travis. His guilt prevailed causing him to react. Travis is an extremely rude, nasty, dismissive, snide and unprofessional person constantly talking down to me. Thanks Club Monaco for nothing."
30,3,"On July, 2016, I attempted to return a pair of shoes to your SoHo location. I was treated extremely rudely by staff who acted as if I was trying to scam the store. I have been a customer of Club Monaco for years, and have never been treated like this by any retailer, ever. The treatment was so... bad I have to reconsider continued patronage of Club Monaco. Because I was so stunned by the treatment and aggravated, I just left the shoes on the counter and walked out of the store."
31,2,"Hi. i made an online order from massimo dutti in November 2017. I got and email says that my package has been delivered in December, but I didn't get I emailed the customer service several time telling them I didn't receive any thing and also emailed the carrier and no answer from... both. now I want my money back."
32,2,"I have attempted to return Christmas gifts within the 30-day return policy. When I received the package, the return label was blank, preventing me to drop it off at the UPS store. When I called the customer service line, I was told that Massimo Dutti doesn't allow shipments to APO/DPO boxes,... therefore the company will not accept the items; that I would not get a return label because ""it would still not get back in time""; that because I was stationed overseas, I should have known how long it was going to take. --When checking out, there are no error flags or anything preventing the shipment of items to an APO/DPO box in page (2) YOUR ACCOUNT nor on page (3) DELIVERY. There is nothing in the Term & Conditions stating that shipping is restricted. --I have sent over 10 emails with not a single personalized response. Automated messages state that I would get a prompt reply, but I haven't gotten a single one. I have also called three times to talk to a manager/supervisor and have been denied every single time because there are none available. I received ONE call back when I was not home and the person did not leave a name and told my wife that ""He has our number in the email"". All I wanted to do is return the items for a different size and enjoy my holiday, that's it."
33,2,Horrible customer service. They shipped the package. I never received. They don't even want to bother reaching out to me or refunding. 0 stars.
34,3,"Never got my order .Called customer service a billion times. They didn't care in fact, they treated me horribly. So I never got my $85 back. It makes me sad because the people at the stores are helpful and I do love Zara, but the telephone customer service is the worst an they are rude. So they make ordering online a bad experience."
35,3,"Saw a super cute dress in the store and noticed a large majority of them had missing or loose buttons. Against my better judgement my sister talked me into purchasing the dress saying that they can't all be poorly constructed and that Zara is a great company and would stand behind their product. Half hour into my dinner (and having the dress on for approx. 45 mins) one of the buttons came off completely and I noticed the remaining buttons were coming loose. Excused myself from dinner and spent half hour sewing the button back on and securing the rest. Spoke with customer agent that said looks like there is nothing wrong, all the buttons are still on from the pictures submitted (yes, still on from me sewing them) spoke with another customer service agent that said since the item has been altered there is nothing they can do! For a company with brand value of approximately 13 BILLION they really should have better products and better customer service!"
36,1,"I was with my husband when he bought a blazer. When we were at the counter he asked if for some reason if he loses the receipt and do not receive the one that is emailed to him...would he have a problem to return the item...and if he wanted store credit he could get that. The cashier said yes... which was a lie. We went back to return the blazer and they will not let him get store credit. They do not have the blazer in his size, and do not have them at the other stores. He does not have the receipt but has the bank statement. He was told that their return policy has recently changed... ok how are the customers suppose to know that? I would not advise no one to shop there.... They have other better stores out there that know how to treat their customers right."
37,1,"Absolutely the worst customer service you can imagine. I spent $350 in merchandise and tried to return it the next day with a receipt and the tags still on. Turns out the cashier had accidentally cancelled the receipt, so I would have to go through head office. Six weeks later, full of complete and utter frustration, they provide me with a reference number, so I can finally get a refund. I happened to be walking by a Zara so I went in with the reference number. They couldn't help me because it wasn't the store I said I'd visit. So today, I receive a call from head office, saying that because I'd gone into a different store, all bets were off! Store credit only. I told them I'd go to the other store, but they'd have none of it. I'd blown it, apparently. And all because THEIR cashier had messed up! Stay away from this place they are crooks!!!!"
38,1,"Every store that I have ever done business with will accept a return if the tags are attached and not worn and with the time period for returns even if the original receipt is not available! Tried to return a shirt and they refused to take it back or just deduct it from a purchase that I was making, never had any store do this.... shitty way of doing business.... lesson learned ...save all your receipts from Zara... or better yet Don’t shop there!!!!"
39,3,"I am writing this review because I have an open case due to a refund that wasn’t issued correctly. I returned an item at the Zara located at the Florida mall (Orlando, Fl) after waiting for more than 10 for my refund to be posted on my account, I noticed something was not right because it usually doesn’t take that long... I went back to the store and the manager pulled out the original transaction and realized the refund wasn’t issued properly, she advised me to call the customer service number on Monday because it was Sunday and the corporate office was closed and assured me that it will take 7 to 10 business days to receive my money back! I filed the case and sent all receipts associated with the transaction on February 7, the representative also told me that it will take 7 to 10 business days to receive my money back and until this day I have not received my money yet and every time I call I get a different answer from everybody, I have never EVER in my life had waited almost a month to get my money back from a return. This is completely disappointing and unacceptable, it’s not a large amount but it’s the principle... This shows how much they care about customers that spend their hard-earned money at your stores. I called again today and they still don’t have an answer, the lady said is being reviewed. If you’re planning on keeping my money for not reason, please at least let me know so that I can go a different route!! I am hoping someone contacts me regarding this situation and maybe get an honest answer by tomorrow, otherwise I’ll assume that you don’t care and that you prefer for me to handle it differently! Thank you!"
40,1,"This is my first time buying from Zara website. I bought a black cross body bag for a friend's birthday this Saturday. I got so excited when i got my package early but when i opened the box it has the wrong item - a pair of shoes. I reviewed my order confirmation and it says in there very clearly that i purchased a purse/bag and even with pictures, so I just do not understand why they made a mistake of not shipping the correct item. I chatted with a staff on their website and told her about my order complaint. She wants me to take a picture of the item to send to her in the chat box for internal investigation. Really??!!! That got me so irritated .... as if I am making up stories about my complaint. ALL I WANT IS MY PURSE WHICH I PAID FOR. Not too mention their return policy really sucks.... after shipping to return I will be refunded for 10 to 14 days???!!! Unfair. Why does a customer like me suffer this long when it was obviously their mistake? Will definitely return the item to them, but I will cancel my order. I would rather spend the money to a more deserving store. No time to deal with this business that obviously does not see the importance of good customer service. Too bad they just lost one customer. My first and my last. Will definitely not recommend to family and friends."
41,2,"I placed an order on zara's website, then when I got the package it was totally wrong, I order children's clothes and received 2 sweaters for woman. I had to return the wrong package and just after that they would send me my actual order, but in the meantime my items got sold out. They totally showed me the middle finger and offer me a $10credit for my next order, which I actually never got it. They have just the most awful customer service I ever had to deal with. I will never EVER buy from them again. Will stick with the American companies that are SO MUCH BETTER."
42,1,"I would like to share my shopping experience with you. I recently ordered a few items online. I never received any types of emails for confirmation or tracking. My package arrived without any paper receipts. Some items had tags while some didn’t, while still others had pen mark all over them. I promptly went to the store to return the items and was told that without a receipt I could not return my items nor get store credit. I do not live close to a store and drove half an hour each way to simply be told to call Zara later on with no help or care from employees or managers in the store. I went home and used the “chat” feature online. I spoke with Manesha which was utterly useless. I spent an hour chatting with someone who was unknowledgeable and actually disconnected our chat when I asked to speak to a manager. I am now stuck with my items and first have to get some kind of receipt and travel yet another hour to return my items. I have never experienced such callous employees, managers, and store chats before. I will not be shopping here again."
43,1,"Gucci customer service is terrible. I have ordered an item from them and never received the item through their carrier. They gave me a deadline of when they would trace the item and satisfy the claim/investigation. Once the deadline came, no attempts were made in reaching out to the carrier to process the investigation. I’ve been getting the run around that someone would call me with updates and no call was made. I had to continuously call for updates without any progress made in their part. The incompetence from a reputable company is deplorable and deters me from ever purchasing from them again. Customer service was in NO way helpful or supportive. Truly ridiculous."
44,1,"Rude and unhelpful telephone customer service representatives that you must wait >20 minutes on hold to speak with; the brick and mortar flagship boutiques don’t even answer their phone; the online “chat representatives” will frequently disconnect with you rather than answering your question; delays in your order oftentimes surpass 3 months; extremely slow shipping (even on expedited orders); extremely slow return process...Overall, Gucci is the worst couture company currently around in regard to customer service. Gucci has an F rating on the BBB for a reason. Behind the fancy clothes are flat out reprehensible representatives in all facets of this “company”. Buyer beware."
45,1,"I made a purchase on 12/19 for a shirt that was on clearance. Using a coupon I purchased it for around $42. I placed this order with 2 day shipping. I contacted Brooks Brothers 12/21 asking why my order said ""Order received"" and pending. I received an e-mail on 12/28 stating that my order could not be fulfilled. Magically, the store STILL had the exact item in stock, but now listed for $92 instead of the clearance price of $68. I was then charged for the item even though this order allegedly couldn't be fulfilled. When I emailed them inquiring about this, I received no answer. I just checked now to see if the charge is off my credit card and it is. No comments from the company at all. I was stuck without a Christmas gift for my cousin without a single explanation for it at all. I'm extremely upset about this lack of transparency within this scam of a company. They've lost my business forever, I'm just sorry we also gave my cousin a $50 gift card to this terrible store."
46,3,"I made notice on October 2016 to Brooks Brothers that I am having a technical problem with their website. Specifically, although I am enrolled in auto-pay, the system shows me an error message when I try to enter settings for auto-pay. I have spoken to their customer service and tech support people many times since my first notice. They acknowledged the problem on Oct and said they assigned a tech supervisor to make the necessary repairs. They said that It should be fixed in 24 hours and that I should check then. Still, as of Oct, the problem has not been repaired contrary to their promises. Further, as of today Oct, customer service let me know that they have no record in their system that a complaint was ever made to them or tech support. Brooks Brothers lack attention to this matter is appalling."
47,3,"I purchased some clothing from the online store and chose the gift option which gives me a bag. This however was not in the package. I contacted the customer service asking that they send a bag to me, after all this is a gift for a close relative. I was told via email that they will not do that and... if I am unhappy I can return the order for a full refund. Returning the order and reordering it will take time and effort on my part when this is the company's mistake. I think it is totally reasonable to expect them to send me a bag as promised during the ordering process. Having paid quite a lot of money for these clothes, I would expect to be treated with more respect."
48,2,Hi I purchase from mays a locoste shirt few weeks ago and the shirt is falling apart they told me i have to you when i called customer services was not pleasant basically told me there is nothing you can do about this i dont understand any company should stand behind there brand and not let the...customer deal with this i always purchase LACOSTE SHIRT and other product after today i don’t know way i spent money on your BRAND if you don’t care about your customer and tell the to go.
49,1,"I will not be purchasing another waist gang society anything ever again. If you pay for a certain color product, and it's not in stock, then don't have it listed as an option and then say we will send what's in stock. That's false advertisement. If it's not in stock, it shouldn't be listed on the website. And when you call their response is lackadaisical."
50,1,Terrible customer service. Garments are not as they portray them to be. Wrong sizes. Increased expense with customer paying shipping back and forth for company's mistakes. No credibility.
51,3,"On 7/16 while attending a celebration for my little sister’s birthday at Turtle Bay Tavern, the management forced our party of over 20 paying customers to leave. Upon arrival (our group did not show up all at once) the 1st arriving friends/family were seated in our reserved section and ordered... food & beverages from a waitress. When served the food (one of our guests were not satisfied with their selection, it was spinach dip and was visibly dry, she then asked the waitress if it could be changed/altered after tasting it. At this time the waitress began to become agitated by the request and rolled her eyes and told the guest that ""she already bit the food and could not change it"". Shortly after that the bill for that specific meal was asked for and when paid the guest did not leave a tip with the bill (at this time the entire group of people still have not arrived). Upon reviewing the check, the waitress returned to the table and confronted the guest pointing her finger in the face of the guest saying ""oh your not going to tip me!"" this resulted in the two having a rather loud discussion over the issue. As I use the word loud I would like to point out that this is a bar and music is played at high levels leaving any type of conversation to be loud. As the waitress left our seated area, more guests for our celebration arrived and purchased beverages from the bar area and food from the table area, approximately 20 guests. About 15-20 minutes pass and then security comes to our area and directly tells us that we need to leave and that all he knows is the waitress told him that we were being aggressive, rude and rowdy. All of which were just not true, this establishment was packed on both floors with drunk and disorderly people, the group of people who arrived with our party were not that. Any of their camera footage will show that. I was able to ask the security to speak with me to the side and asked him as to why he was telling our party to leave and that we have a reserved section. He then let me know that he would go and get the manager to help clear up the situation. Prior to the manager arriving I personally witnessed the waitress proceed to tell her manager the same lies she had told security to get us to leave. I then approached the manager as he was yelling at our party ""Who is in charge, who disrespected my waitress"". Trying to explain to him the situation with the service of his waitress all he kept doing was repeating himself ""Anyone who disrespect my staff has to leave"" and then just ignoring anytime myself or any one else from our party by pulling his phone out and looking down. This was completely handled unprofessionally and was a major inconvenience to even attempt to relocate a planned birthday celebration to another location at 11:30pm. Frankly the manager was very arrogant as if he has bar in NYC and will fill it anyway. This situation could have been resolved in a much better way than how it was handled. As we were forced to leave I was unable to ask for a refund on any food & beverage that was purchased as the majority of the goods & services could not be consumed or used."
52,1,"I reserved a section/table on the evening of Saturday December, 2017 at Hudson Terrace. The table reservation came with one bottle of liquor. Throughout the course of the night, I wanted to purchase an additional bottle for my table. The bottle service woman came back to my table and informed me... that my card declined (which was untrue because the purchases were reflected when I checked my acct online). Apparently, they kept charging my card (according to the bank it was a total of five transactions), that were unwarranted. I spoke with the manager who was extremely unprofessional and unaccommodating for their mishap with their processing. They kept lying and telling me ""Oh we didn't charge you twice, we reversed the transaction"" (which was another lie) because again they took a total of almost $1,400 from my acct. Because it was a holiday weekend, and all they kept telling me was to contact my bank, and they were closed, I had to wait until Tues to try to dispute it on my banks end. Apparently, on Wed 12/17 they put another hold on my acct for $460 something dollars. To make a long story short, my bank said there's nothing I can do until this hold clears on my acct and to call this company and report them for their unlawful business practices. They then cancelled my card because they suspected fraudulent charges from this company. It's now day 5, and this company is still trying to take more money from my account."
53,1,"Spoke to a promoter via email to guarantee that I would have a table at Hudson Terrace for my 25th Birthday celebration in NYC. We agreed that I would have a buy 2 bottles get 1 free deal and I could bring as many girls as I wanted and 8 guys (4 per purchased bottle). Put down a $50 security deposit a week ahead of time. Traveled to NYC from Boston with a group of 10 people on Saturday March **, 2017. Showed up at Hudson Terrace and spoke to a bouncer about the table I had booked with the promoter. They had my reservation on file and asked how many people I had and all. I explained what Josh and I had discussed. I was told that I was only allowed 10 people and the rest would have to pay cover despite the fact that I had emails between Josh and myself stating that I would not have to pay. The bouncer was giving me a hard time so I agreed to pay cover for the additional people. Then he continued saying that I would be better off with one more bottle since I would be paying cover for the additional people at $30 per person. So I agreed to buy an extra bottle instead of paying cover. The bouncer takes my ID and credit card then returns a few minutes later to tell me he has no table for me. I asked for an explanation and he tells me that he sold my table to a party that was paying more than me. It was literally a complete scam. Hudson Terrace did not honor any part of my agreement with the promoter that their club works with. They turned me away saying that there are plenty of other places in NYC."
54,3,"On Saturday April 8, 2017 I was at Green Rock Bar and Grill with a few of my friends. We had two drinks each. The first round of drinks I ordered were made and charged correctly. The second round my friend bought using her card. We paid, left a tip and she took her card and we moved away from the... bar area to let the next group of people in, when I noticed that there was a cracked plastic shot glass in my drink. I went back to the bartender who goes by the name ""Slim"" to ask if he could make me a new drink since there was a shot glass in it. I waited until he was finished making the drinks he was currently making, and he approached me. I said ""hey, I'm sure this is an honest mistake but there is a shot glass in my cup and I would like a new one."" With his own choice words of telling me what to do with my drink and that shot glass he refused to make me a new one. He carried on cat-calling towards me and making inappropriate comments and gestures still refusing to remake my drink that was a simple vodka club. I did not blame him wasn't looking for my money back but as a paying customer he should have remade my drink and not curse, make sexually inappropriate comments towards me and done was he is paid and tipped to do. Instead of remaking my drink ""Slim"" thought it would be better to carry on with his side conversations and dancing while intimating and mocking me."
55,2,"To whom it may concern, I have ordered a salad from Garden Grill today. This is not the first time I ordered from this business. They're in very close proximity so the delivery was always fast. But today I had the worst customer service experience in my life with this business' manager. Let me... tell you. I've ordered and I ordered their ""California Cobb Salad"" which is written exactly as ""chicken with avocado, gorgonzola cheese over mixed greens, served with cucumbers and tomatoes"". The salad came with NO AVOCADO, with chicken, cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes AND additionally green peppers, mushrooms and a boiled egg. Does this sound anything like the description? Anyways, things happen, you know. I do work at a restaurant, too, I understand. Luckily, I wasn't allergic to any of the ingredients that wasn't written there and came with the salad. What I did is I called the restaurant and spoke to a lady who answered the phone and told them that they sent me a total different thing than what I saw and ordered online and I basically want someone come to pick up the salad and refund my money back. She advices me does the opposite. Anyways, I called and the first lady I spoke to, put me on hold and spoke to the restaurant I believe. Then she told me that the restaurant's manager would like to speak to me and he was going to call me from the number on my account. Okay. He did called me right after and I tried to explain him the same thing as I did to everybody. You sent me a different salad than what was written on your online menu and I wouldn't order it if I knew it had mushrooms and green peppers and I simply want you to take back your salad and give back my money. He told me these things won't work that way that he sent me a cobb salad and he wouldn't give me a refund. When I didn't accept what he was trying to pull, he literally hung up the phone on my face. This was the worst customer care I have ever experienced in my life."
56,1,"The service at McFadden's Bar at Town Square is extremely slow, the floors and tables are always sticky, the manager is never working, the don't return your calls, and the worst part about all of it is their ""open bar"" is a scam to get people in to spend money on drinks.They advertise and give away ""open bar"" for people every Thursday. Whoever wins that gets to drink ONLY specific well drinks and specific beer from about 10-12 and that's it. Your friends drink half off for only 2 hours as well. It takes at least 10 mins to get your drink and they rush you when taking your order, so you may get 3 drinks in the time given. They also promise to give away a 3 day/2-night trip for two to some fancy beach or island (Cancun, Bahamas, Jamaica etc.) for the person who brought the most guest to ""open bar"".I was nominated for ""open bar"" and the only reason I went was to try to win the grand prize trip. I sent out text messages, e-mails, and made announcement to get my friends and family to come. I had about 15 people show up, spend money, and I won the grand prize on Feb 16, 2017 What they don't tell you is that they're teamed up with a fraud traveling agency named. This place is a SCAM and ask for $90 cash or cash check before even getting any information on your trip. Also, a payment of $50 for a voucher form and $40 for processing AND they don't cover all the flight expenses. You buy your tickets to the city they departure from and the tickets to the Bahamas. They don't accept any form of debit or credit card and I found this suspicious. When I did more research on better business bureau I found out more than one person has been scammed by this agency. I informed the sales/marketing director, Tanya, at McFadden's in person on 3/20/17 and she promised to fix it which she didn't. We e-mailed for 3 months, the manager never returned my calls, and I never received a prize. They continue to use this agency regardless of the scam proven to them."
57,2,"On the night of April 9th, 2016, I went to, where I had gone many times before, for entertainment. Upon leaving early the next day on April 10th, 2016 I noticed a horrible ringing in my ears called tinnitus. The tinnitus annoyed me everyday, all day long, for about three months until it began to seem less severe. Nonetheless, symptoms are still ongoing. At the present time, I mostly notice the tinnitus at night. Tinnitus is a symptom of hearing loss, so I have felt compelled to avoid so as to avoid any further damage to my hearing. A formal notice to retain evidence (which is sometimes referred to as a legal hold) was mailed to Ala Carte Entertainment via U.S. Certified Mail (return receipt requested) to notify the company of its legal duty to preserve evidence related to this incident. The notice to retain evidence also requested that Ala Carte Entertainment notify the insurance carrier of this claim so that I may receive compensation for the injuries I suffered as a result of the hazardous environment that existed on the premises. However, I have not received any communication from the insurance carrier nor Ala Carte Entertainment regarding this matter. It is my understanding that Ala Carte Entertainment has a commercial insurance policy as mandated by local municipal law to cover injuries. Therefore, Ala Carte Entertainment should have notified the insurance carrier of this claim so that I would receive compensation for the injuries to my hearing. Nevertheless, I have not even received communication from the insurance carrier nor Ala Carte Entertainment regarding this matter. Consequently, Ala Carte Entertainment has lost my trust with its excessive sound volume and its failure to address and resolve my complaint."
58,1,"I was a patron at the night club on evening of May 5th/6th. And very unfortunate to fall down the black, unlit, and dark stair case. Which caused major laceration, bruising, sprain to both of my legs. Following Monday, I have emailed, inquiring on assistance of filing a proper... claim for their negligence. I was advised an insurance adjuster will be in contact with me. After one week of not receiving any contact, I sent a follow up email. And received the same response. Right now, it has been two weeks. They have yet to provide me with the insurance company information. I still do not have a claim number, reference number, adjuster information, no one contacted me regarding my injury. This is a disgusting and pure negligence to my injury and pain. Absolutely no human decency for the pain I have been put through. As a business, they should be on top of their claims and making sure they are providing me with best customer service and care. The business moral is horrible and just shows their inhumane approach to someone’s else’s suffering caused by their negligence."
59,3,When I first entered this establishment the bouncer at the door was rude and using vulgar language. At the end of the night as I was leaving there was a dispute outside between a bouncer and another customer. As I was walking past the bouncer shoved the man right into me causing me to fall. When I... got up I got thrown to the floor by another bouncer who came rushing to jump into the fight that had started. I was furious but quickly left when I seen 3 grown men (bouncers) attacking one man on the ground. The bouncers were swinging at the man on the floor. This business has bouncers that are unprofessional and clearly use excessive force.
60,2,"I was visiting from out of town and left my ID at the restaurant and they weren't open by the time my transportation left the following morning, so I called that day and asked them if they could mail my ID to the address on the driver's license. They transferred me to a voicemail of a manger, who neglected to return my call. I called back the next day spoke to a manager who assured me he would mail it out the next business day (Tuesday as it happened over the Labor Day weekend). I waited until Friday and still hadn't received my ID. I called them back and they said they still had my ID and hadn't mailed it. I asked them why they hadn't mailed it and they said ""Um I'm not sure, let me transfer you to a manager, she's REALLY good at calling people back."" I did leave her a voicemail, but still no call backs after expressing my urgency. I called again now over a week later and asked them if I could speak to a manager and they said ""No you can't speak to a manager and we can't mail the ID to you so you are going to have to drive to get it."" I pleaded with them to mail it and I would pay for it, but they said they were too busy and they couldn't do it. Then a new gentleman said he his employee couldn't talk to me anymore (after only a few minutes of me asking for options) and said good day and hung up. I've gone above and beyond for my customers all my life even when I didn't have to so it's very disappointing to see a business operate like this. Needless to say I don't need to go back into that establishment."
61,3,"I made a reservation for a specific time and area and received an email confirmation regarding my request. Once arrived, the area was taken and was told they do not honor requests for the area I requested, yet I recieved a confirmation on what I requested. The Manager on duty advised me I had to sit elsewhere. Yet, during prior dining experiences at the same location, ""Reservation"" signs were placed in the same place I had requested. Once seated, my Wife and I experienced a longer than usual wait time even when the Restaurant was empty. My waitress rolled her eyes and would nod her head at me during my dining experience. I want answers!"
62,3,"On Sept 9th, our NE party watched the game at the Fan Draught Brewery. When it came time to split our bill, our friends had agreed to cover the tip since they had more food/drink. Our total bill was $78 (w/o tip) and our portion of the bill was $39. I had added $0 for the tip, signed and left the... bill. We had confirmed our friends did provide a $20 tip (i.e. 20% of the total). After checking my bank statement, I had learned that the server had deliberately added $10 to my tab. I immediately contacted the restaurant, left a VM with the general manager but have not heard back. It is an unfortunate and yet a deliberate act by this restaurant's server to skim money from our bill..."
63,3,"On 10/23/15, I was mischarged on my bar tab. I was rung up an extra $14 for two drinks I did not order, and charged $12.50 a piece for well shots, that should have been $4 each. I contacted the owner of the bar (Joseph) the following day, and he said he would look into it and promised to... fix the problem. After a few weeks, I had not heard from him, so I reached out again. His attitude changed completely and told me I should have let him know at the bar the evening it happened, because there was nothing he could do after the fact. He was not at the bar the night I was over charged. He agreed, however to give me a $16 bar tab. I went to the bar many times since, and he would never make time to speak to me, and the bar tenders all refused any type of tab. Joseph has refused to respond to any other messages or voicemails regarding this and has yet to rectify the situation. On 5/6/16 I had another issue with the same bartender. I ordered two drinks, and was given a receipt for $14, which is a correct charge. However, the bartender charged my card for $16.80, and extra $2.80, which I did not authorize. This was PRIOR to me tipping. I tried several times to contact Joseph about this issue as well, but a month later, I have not received any type of response from him. I have Facebook messages saved documenting our conversation regarding this."
64,1,"On June 16th I stopped at Nekter to purchase 2 perishable items. the first item was a shake that was a date nut shake which i had no issues with immediately upon consumption. The sec on and third purchases were 2 ready made cold pressed juices 1) greenies and 2) beach berries. On June 17th I consumed a small amount AT 11 AM of both juices mixed and had very bad stomach issues, cramping, headache and diarrhea. I have consumed products before IN CALIFORNIA, I KNOW headaches AND VERY BAD CRAMPING are a sign of food poisioning. After a night of restless sleeping and finally at 10 am June 18th I drove to the nekter store located at 6712 Snider Plaza Dallas Texas 75205 at approximately 11am I spoke to the employee at nekter and told them of my concern and the young sales associate turned me over to the manager LaTaurus. I was never apologized to nor did she seems concerned that possibly poor health practices could be at fault at their store, she did not even seemed concerned with contacting the owner to have the products checked. I am concerned because i became very sick after drinking the juices, and the temperature of the fridge seemed to be a concerning as well. NO HAIR NETS, GLOVES OR HAND WASHING DURING CONTACT WITH FOOD WAS EVER WITNESSED. JUICES STORED IN OPEN FRIDE HAVE CONSOLIDATED CLUMPS AND SEPARATED."
65,2,"My boyfriend and I went to this place on Sunday 10/22/17 to have drinks and watch the game. It seemed like a pretty cool spot. Becca which was the ONLY bartender working came out and took our drink order. When she brought our drinks I got half way through my drink and realized it had lipstick on the glass. So my boyfriend took the drink back in advised her to just cash us out that I didn't want another drink. She came out to confirm that I didn't want another drink and she was just going to charge us for one drink. She never apologized for the dirty glass she gave me. Becca brings out the receipt where she ran my credit card for $12.12, no receipt to see how much the drinks were. I looked on the menu because I felt that was a lot for one drink and nothing on the drink menu was over $10. My boyfriend took the receipt back to her and asked her to show how much the drinks was. The drinks were only $8.00 and she only credited me for $4.80 he asked why and she didn't have a reason, so Becca ran my credit card again for $8.65 (without my card) so now on my bank statement it shows $14.54. So I go back in again and asked for her to show me where my credit is because I'm showing she ran my card again without issuing me a credit. She refused to show me and she got all upset but all I was asking was to show me where you credit me back. I told her it seem like she was trying to be slick and not fully take my drink off like she said she would. Instead she only took off half price. She started talking loud telling me she cant help me anymore and for me to have a good day. So we left because the people at the bar started yelling at me and didn't have clue what was going on. Two hours later she friend requested me. I went to her inbox and asked her what could I do for her. I was confused of why she go out the way to find me. She wanted to explain what happened and I wasn't trying to hear that because she had a chance to explain. I will never go to this place bad service!!!"
66,3,"I visited Park Avenue March 31,2018. I purchased drinks at the bar in VIP, my bill was 26.00 and I left a $4.00 tip making the total $30.00. On April 2, 2018 when the transaction posted to my account it was for $66. I contacted Park Ave there was no answer so I sent an email. A lady named Sylvia called shortly after and asked for the last 4 of my card number and expiration date. She advised me she will need to pull the receipts from that night and give me a callback. I have yet to receive a callback or refund."
67,1,"I purchased four upgraded tickets to the 2nd Annual Alcohol Infused Festival, and I did not receive one of the advertised products that were promised.I purchased 4 ""Boozy Bites"" tickets for $45.00 from Groupon to the Alcohol Infused Festival held on Sunday, July 17, 2016. The event was held on July 17th from 2:00 pm to 10:00 pm. I am a very, very unsatisfied customer. Instead of simply purchasing a ""general admission"" ticket, I spent extra money for the promised ""samples from all vendors and mini tipsy dessert ice cream brew."" When we arrived at the event at 2:23 pm, we began waiting in a line that wrapped around the building. We did not move for almost 45 minutes. Then a huge thunderstorm caused us to run for cover at a neighboring establishment because the venue offered did not provide shelter. After the rain finally stopped, we got back into the long line for about an hour. We were so excited to finally reach the door. We reached the door at 5:17 pm. We waited in line for a total of 2 hours before entering. We received our 10 yellow tickets (per person) and our orange wristbands. To our unfortunate disappointment, we only entered the threshold of yet another line for all of the dessert vendors. The venue was extremely packed and very unsafe in the event of a disaster. Once inside, all of the customers were confused. None of the event volunteers knew details about what our ""Boozy Bites"" tickets bought us. We waited in line for another hour in hopes of receiving some of the promised samples. After the first 3 vendors admitted to being ""out"" of samples, my group decided to check out the outside vendors in hopes of using our 10 tickets for something. However, none of the food vendors would take the tickets. They did have a few free samples, but these were not the ""Booozy Bites"" we paid for. We then decided to try and at least get the ""ice cream brew"" that we were promised - only to find out that line snaked around and over a couple hours long. And who knew whether or not they would be ""out"" when we got up there. Fed up with this disorganization and utter chaos that this ""festival"" brought us, the four of us left, very disappointed and unsatisfied. Because we did not receive one penny of the samples that the ""Boozy Bites"" tickets promised, I requested a refund. No one at the door was capable of honoring my request. They were volunteers who were likely plucked off the street - they knew nothing about the festival details. I also sent an email requesting a full refund to the email provided on the website and received no response. I do not believe, as a paying customer, that I should be treated in this way. If a product is promised, it should be provided, otherwise this is sadly false advertisement. Every single customer at this ""festival"" was unhappy, and many of them wrote reviews on Facebook and Yelp. However, the owner of this establishment has since deleted many of the negative comments. Through some serious digging, I found out that last year's event was a disaster as well, the owner simply hid the negative comments to get more people to come this year. The owner has had no repercussions, and innocent customers are suffering. The owner should, at the very least, be forced to refund the money to customers who did not receive the products promised. "
68,2,"I visited this establishment with a friend, purchased one drink for $9.00 ($7.75 + $1.25 courtesy tip), and was seated at the bar. My friend was singing a karaoke song. I asked the bartender to please hold my seat for a minute while I went to pick a karaoke song. While I was picking a song, two... female patrons took my seat and my friend's. When I returned, I asked the bartender (not the patrons) what happened to my seat, to which one of the female patrons replied with a profane remark toward me. I replied and engaged in a verbal altercation with the female patron, and was then told by staff that I had to leave the establishment. I asked for a refund because I hadn't been able to drink the beverage I had purchased. The manager refused to refund my money. The man working the front door then physically assaulted me. Because my friend and I still wanted to have a good time, we decided against calling the police and instead went to another establishment. However, if Texas Billiards is unwilling to settle with me, I intend to pursue both criminal and civil remedies to the fullest extent of the law."
69,1,"I had the unfortunate experience of stepping into this club, varsity tavern, in the early hours of Saturday, November 25, 2017. After having ID checked at the door I walked in and made my way to the stairs, when suddenly a man grabbed me and shook me to the side out of his way. I told this person ""Do not touch me."" The man apparently worked for the club and at that point decided I did not deserve to be inside the business. What happened from there was a violent grab and choke around my throat as I was dragged through the bar leaving all my friends with blank expressions wondering aloud what I even did? The best excuse the bar came up with was that I was blocking traffic, not one person from the staff told me what I had done wrong before resorting to violent measures. Overall it is very disappointing to have gone through such an experience at the hands of ""professionals"" that are given the authority to harm others at a whim notice without any regard for higher management, the health of the customer, or any repercussion. The violence subjected to me was completely uncalled for and I challenge Varsity tavern to review the tapes from that night around midnight and take action to end this Wild West behavior."
70,1,Me and 3 others wanted to try this place out but they would not let us in because of our skin color! First they used the excuse that because my bf was wearing Jordan's he was not allowed in then would not let his friend in because he was wearing a baseball cap. As we got out of line there was a white male with a hat and got let right in. I read so many reviews on google exactly like mine. If your not white they will not let you in.
71,3,"I have been trying to obtain an itemize receipt and a signature receipt because I was overcharged. I have been trying to obtain the receipt since December 9th, 2017 for purchases of December 8th. I have been in contact and he won’t respond to me. When I called again on the... 23rd, I spoke to another, who told me that, I had spoken to had a million other things to do and will have him follow up. I have again tried contacting them with no response."
72,3,"To Whom It May Concern: My complaint regards a denial of refund on the morning of 04/17/2016; roughly around 3:30am. I and a group, of 6 others, entered this establishment under the impression of sitting at the bar to consume alcohol. Once we realized the bar was closed, due to the time frame.... We discussed, as a group, to leave and ask for our money to be refunded – as we did not partake in the entertainment or drinks. Even though we hadn’t been there for more than 30 minutes, I was informed that our money would not be refunded and we should know the laws. I explained that we were ignorant to the law; we assumed that since the establishment was open, the bar was still open. Please note that two individuals out of my group did not arrive until about 2 minutes before we asked for the refund; they were not even there for 10 minutes and were still denied a refund. The total refund was be $105.00; $15 per person. I was not offered another option and felt I was stonewalled. Thank you."
73,3,"I visited this bar on Sat, Feb 4, with my 3 adult children. I turned 54 in Jan and they had given me an overnight trip to Savannah with just them for my gift. It was our first get away together, just the 4 of us, ever. We had walked along the river, stopped and had lunch, were walking in stores, and... my son and daughter ended up going to The Bar while my daughter and I finished looking around the city marketplace. When we met up with them, they were sitting at the far end of the bar, just the two of them, so we joined. The bartender’s demeanor completely changed. He asked my oldest daughter, who was wearing a purple hat, why she had a had on and told her she seemed bitter. He also said he could tell we were all from Florida because of the amount of make up wore. I think we all still felt in some way that he was teasing, and it was his way of making conversation. He then asked if any of my children were married (no) or had children. My middle daughter said she had a daughter and was pregnant again, hence why she was only drinking water and we all laughed. His comment was ""so you screwed up the first time and your trying again."" We pulled up a picture on our phone to show how beautiful my grand daughter is and he said she was cute. Still trying to take this as a person with just a different personality. My son announced we were celebrating my birthday and asked for birthday shots. The bartender was agreeable, but I totally refused to drink a shot. The part that bothered me worst is that after my son began talking to him (my son has a speech impairment) the bartender looked at me and said ""he didn't go to college or finish school did he?"" i couldn't believe he made that comment and I didn't know how to handle so I repeated ""did he go to school?"" he said ""did he finish school?"" My daughter went to comment and he ""shushed"" her. I was mortified. My daughter tested up and we tabbed out. The bartender knew he had visibly upset us and didn't have us pay for the two shots my son and daughter did. There's a lot to this but here's the think. My son is 27 and is so self-conscious with little to no self esteem. This completely crushed him, He was embarrassed and humiliated in front of all of us. As we walked back to our room he kept saying ""do you realize how bad that guy just disrespected me?"" He wanted to go back but we knew that wasn't a good idea as we all were very angry and upset. We were just a family trying to enjoy s quick out-of-town trip together and this happened. No one, no one, should ever speak to another individual like that much less an employee to customers...not one, he put down all of us. You can apologize but the hurtful words will forever stick with my son. I don't know what I want, other than someone to hear my complaint and hopefully get this employee away from people. I reached out to the restaurant twice but still have not received a call back. This was totally unacceptable, and mother, even though my kids are grown, it completely broke my heart. I cried at the hotel where my children couldn't see, I cried when I got home and told my husband, and I cried today telling my sister. I just know how much it insulted and hurt my son. Something you can't get past. We did nothing to this person. He was just rude, nasty, and shouldn't be allowed to serve people"
74,1,"I went to an event at The EndUp on March 25 with a ticket that said free entry before 3:00. I arrived over 15 minutes (I have proof from my lift invoice) before the slated time, but they refused to let us in until 3:05 and demanded we pay cover. The venue was empty, so there was no capacity issues (I took pictures that prove it). When we left a promoter asked us about our experience and we responded honestly. One of the security team overheard and told me he was going to ""slap"" me. Another told me ""then walk across the street then."" Yet another told me ""why are you talking? You're not a dude."" Unethical advertising and bait and switch tactics, rude, and threatened me with violence."
75,3,"I went to this location for New Years Eve, and was extremely disappointed regarding the way it was advertised compared to what we got (certain things were advertised that were never received). However, since my complaint is not to do with the advertising, more so the lack of appropriate customer... service, I'll get to it - I just wanted to add that because it is all very frustrating. While I was there, the service was EXTREMELY slow (they only had 2 bartenders for a widely advertised New Years Eve event), and the bartenders were pretty rude. Secondly, my boyfriend got thrown out for ""throwing up"" when he did not. I was with him the entire time. The security guard told me he just needed fresh air and would bring him back to where I was after. Now, the security guard didn't allow me to go outside with him when I tried, and ended up just kicking him out and not letting him back in (so I sat inside the club by myself for awhile before realizing he wasn't coming back). I walked outside later to find my boyfriend waiting outside as he wasn't allowed back in - for no good reason. Now my real frustration comes even after all of this. Somewhere in the shuffle of things I had set my purse down and couldn't find it when I went to leave. Due to my coat check ticket being in my purse I wasn't able to get my coat at the end of the night either. It is now 1/10/16, and I have tried to call all the numbers listed for the bar, email the address posted on their FB page, as well as email from their site. I have received no answer to any of my calls, no calls back (I left my info in an email I sent since there is no way to leave them a phone message) and have received no email back. I am infuriated. I have read many other reviews about people who complained about this ""business"" so I know I am not the only one getting poor treatment from this place. I have even tried to reach them via Facebook comment/message as well as Twitter, hoping the social media outlet would draw their attention. No luck."
76,2,"So I went into this BMW location with extreme confidence that I was going to receive the best service possible on what I though was routine maintenance. I was treated by the sales rep there as he checked my car in for a simple oil change. My car worked perfect Except the sunroof which I told the... representative had an issue. I requested that they make sure not to open the sunroof. Two hours later my car was ready and I picked it up. Somehow the guy cleaning the car pushed the sunroof button and broke the plastic guides for the Pano roof. Because of the kind of person I am I let it go. That night I turned my AC on and it would not cool. My AC was just checked and was not leaking a month prior. I charged the AC which was at half level and now it works and has been working for three months no leaks. Why would they drain my refrigerant? Three months after the oil change my car is low on oil. I checked and it only has 3 quarts of oil in the engine. That means 4.5 quarts were burned in an engine that barely burned half a quart every 1500 miles. Honestly, it's impossible but I wanted to test it. I did my own oil change and a month has gone with no oil burning. All in all I trusted BMW because of their name but was given almost criminal service. I feel coned and taken advantage of. I love my car and it only has 75K on it and was never abused. Why would they deliberately attempt to bring me back to the service for costlier repairs? I love the cars but no longer will go to BMW for anything including service."
77,1,"I recently visited Infiniti of Manhattan and put a down payment of 3,200 dollars on a vehicle that I wanted to lease and later changed my mind. It has been has seven days and I have yet to receive a credit of my down payment. I have contacted my bank and they do not see a credit pending, even though... the dishonest sales people keep telling me that credited my money. The sales people that work at the Manhattan location are very unprofessional and don't seem to know what they are doing. Every time I call they give me the run around."
78,1,"Worst Purchase Experience of my ENTIRE LIFE! Went in to buy my first Mercedes. Did not know anything about the brand except some mild research. WARNING! Cars look beautiful under the lights at Manhattan Mercedes. My piano black C63 AMG looked flawless in the dealership. Several days later, in direct sunlight, i saw swirls from compounding. When they tried to fix it, they swirled the entire car now on two occasions, leaving me with almost no clear coat. I spent $1500 to have the paint corrected and coated by a true professional. If you check BBB you will see this paint issue is a regular occurrence here at Mercedes Manhattan, although they are efficient at having these complaints removed. Its appalling, as my detailer and I saw first hand, they buff cars in the basement with improper lighting and dirty/used pads.... BAD BAD BAD. I specifically asked, and was told that the car had a major performance component (limited slip differential), only to learn that the car did not have it after purchasing it. That mistake cost me $4,000. How an AMG comes without an LSD is anybody’s guess...its flat out dangerous. I’m also really disappointed in the build quality of this car. I’ve also driven many loaner cars. They all rattle with bass and some whistle and/or whine at speed.... not what I expected. My car has a symphony of undesired harmonics. So after much effort, I gave up with trying to have them do the right thing for me and went to my local Mercedes Dealership. That was a totally different experience. However, I just learned that the cars engine has an aftermarket tune installed in the car Even though i bought it at the dealership with a full CPO warranty. Seriously... Please do not patronize this establishment. I paid top dollar for bottom shelf. Great Business model...this is the type of review that comes from a profit first environment. I expected FAR better treatment from Manhattan Mercedes. Worst Purchase Experience of my ENTIRE LIFE!!!"
79,2,"My car has been repaired as an insurance claim. The final product is unacceptable. Missing pieces, poor paint job, and the interior of the car left really messy. Finishing compound or paint on the leather seats. Oil all over the carpet, etc.... Was trying to solve the case, but Steve the from body... shop doesn't really care about to solve it. He said that they are not responsible about any of it, and the work is done."
80,1,"GO ELSEWHERE!!! There are 3 four star rated Fiat Alfa Romeo dealerships within 30 minutes of this one. IF you do decide to shop here, just check Truecar.com and when you speak with Alan Z.; DO NOT budge from your true car price, no matter if you have bad credit or no credit. If they tell you you're approved, the numbers don't matter, approval is approval. The only number that might increase is your down payment, but that will subsequently decrease your monthly payments; this is only done for security purposes as people with lower credit have a higher tendency to default on payments, so that is why dealerships feel more secure with a larger down payment and smaller monthly payments (easier for a person in debt to maintain smaller monthly payments). Wily dealerships, like this one, increase your down payment but do not decrease your monthly payments, they never explain any of this to you, they try to make it seem as people with lower credit have to pay more because they have lower credit, but there is no logic behind that, other than the fact that a person with lower credit ends up paying more for credit options in general because he/she tends to make lower payments and therefore ends up paying more in interest. This is not the case with leasing which is what I was looking to do. Anyway, I digresse. JUST DONT GO HERE!!!"
81,3,"The auto service answering service was extremely rude when I need to make appointment for an estimate of my car damage due to accident. I lease my car with fiat and thought to have it fixed there. Since it was going to be my first time there, I had to ask several questions in regard to their operations hours, so I can better fit my time. However, asking questions seem to be the start of the problem with the lady who answered the phone. It was Tuesday evening at 5:30pm on 6/*/2016 and I could only make my call after my work in OR. It was probably close to her time off work, but people really don't think that not everyone has the luxury to make a phone call during regular office hours. People like me who work in medical field starts our days early at 6am and end our days later than office hours. She may had a bad day, but I just finished trying to saving someone's loved ones/daughter/son/mom/dad's life in the OR. I really don't appreciate rudeness."
82,3,"Recently I attempted to schedule a service appointment at Fiat of Manhattan via their online portal. I was not able to do so without providing a current telephone number. In my outreach to them, I specifically requested to not be contacted by phone. Despite this request, I've been contacted by phone by them 10 times in less than 4 days but never leave messages. Today, they called me again regarding the purchase of a used vehicle (which was never my reason for contacting them), so I told them that they needed to lose my number and not call me again. They said they wouldn’t, but I doubt that will be the case. At this point, it feels like harassment to me."
83,1,"Lease payment agreements were highly inflated from what was agreed upon with the salesperson. I was lied to about why the payments were so high. The reason they gave me was that there were maintenance fees and my approval rating was very high. But after further research I learned that they are... still charging me for my old leased vehicle (6 months of payments) after I returned it, when I insisted that I didn't want it to be included in the price of the new vehicle. Ironically, my old vehicle was sold to someone else while I was still doing my paperwork, so Fiat is now collecting payments on that vehicle from me and someone else at the same time, at no benefit to me. But after approaching Caleb the finance manager about it, he admitted that they had charged me anyway, and basically I couldn't do anything about it. They are notorious for scamming clients at this location. Their reviews are 1.5 stars. With many negative videos, as well."
84,2,"I tried to schedule a safety recall fix for my Dodge vehicle. Within minutes I got an email asking for a survey to be filled out on quality of the dealership. The survey URL was a 404 error. Then minutes later I got 13 emails from a Q Berry stating that it was understood I was in the market for a new vehicle and when could I schedule a test drive. Since I have gone to this dealership within the last 12 months, they have failed to ever update (e.g., site so you can download updates to your radio) and have continuously failed to schedule service but always emails me about buying a new car. I will take my vehicle elsewhere and never return to this chop shop."
85,1,"I bring my car in for service and I leave with damage to my rear bumper. After confronting the service rep, he states that it was brought in with the scratch. He points to his paperwork showing the VERY large scuff on the corner of my bumper. First off, I did not sign the documentation when I dropped it off. So I ask, why didn't I get a copy once I dropped it off? ""Oh, we only give it if requested."" So, I ask where is the camera footage, so we can put this to rest. Oh, we don't have any cameras. How convenient for Dodge, no cameras or paperwork given to the customer unless it's requested. See the attached photo of how close the park attendants get to the pillars. You will see all the scuff marks on the white pillar, they cannot tell me the scuffs are done by shopping carts or any other fantasy excuse. The service guy was beyond rude to say the least. At one point there was a service attendant leaving his desk, he turned to the lady next to him (who was really nice by the way) and says ""Don't you have those days you want to punch someone in the face!"" Regardless of how bad your day, you don't threaten another person, period. Especially not in front of customers. At the end, they were willing to split the cost with me. It was $250 worth of damage, and I paid $125. For me, it's not the money. It's my time wasted, and having to deal with rude customer service. The service center should not work there at all, with the small interactions I had with coworkers of his, their response was ""I just don't go near that guy."" He is that guy in the work place, someone who no one likes working with but they have to deal with it. Do not take my word for it (management if you're reading this). Do a blind moral survey, and see how everyone feels about the office. As for me, I will not take my vehicle over there any more and will recommend everyone to stay away. You don't treat customers the way he does, nor fellow coworkers. While bragging of 30+ years of working at Dodge, it goes to show how far he has advanced... and for obvious reasons. If anyone still insists on going to Dodge Manhattan for ANY reason, make sure you request a copy of the damage report BEFORE leaving (they will not voluntarily give it to you.) Take a few pictures of your car and move about your day. I spent two days going back and forth with them, and a full day at the autobody shop (they were great!). In the world of online reviews, Dodge Manhattan should pay a little more attention on what is being said on the net. If anyone would like to contact me from Dodge, please do so. "
86,1,"My buddy and I had a handshake deal with GABE on a new 2016 Grand Cherokee Limited 4WD for $369/month and $3,000 down. They put the deal on paper and he signed. They then claimed that the bank couldn't provide a lease (despite a 790-credit score). Said all they could do was $399 a month. These guys are two-timing, double-dealing liars and I would not recommend them to someone unless I really really hated them."

What an awful mess Chrysler has given me and their Resolution Department offered me a One Time Car payment of $493.13. At 21,000 miles Chrysler service of Manhattan tried on four attempts to repair the Transmission but was unsuccessful in doing so. The anti- lock Brakes were know longer under warranty I'd also like to mention that Joe a staff is extremely rude unprofessional. Another staff told me that Chrysler 200s are Manufactures Defects that they come into service in bad condition. In some Vehicles the Engine stops while the Car is in motion. Please help.

88,3,"I leased my car from Diamante Leasing in Brooklyn, with the contract signed with Nissan of Manhattan on December ,2016. As of now, I still did not receive my license plate and am forced to drive with the expired registration. The registration has expired on 01/2017. I contacted both... Diamante Leasing, as well as Nissan of Manhattan, to no avail.

89,1,"Purchased and paid in full a 2016 red Nissan Altima on 1/17. Was given a temporary license plate which expired on 2/17. Called the general manager Vincent a week later asking when we can receive the license plates, registration and title. Mr. told me he was working on and will... contact me when plates, registration and title to the car comes in. He also promised to pay for any penalties, tickets and anything else associated with this matter. Today is 3/17 and am still driving with the expired temporary plates. I was told the paperwork was misplaced and are working on resolving the issue. Nissan still did not resolved this issue and do not know what to do. This is illegal! Who can I contact to help?"
90,3,"I leased a vehicle from this dealership on January, 2017. On this day I dropped off my 2014 Nissan Rogue to pick up my 2016 Nissan Rogue. As per the lease, the dealership was to provide my registration and plates for my new vehicle within 30 days of purchase. On March, 2017, the temporary... registration expired. Before this date, I had made several attempts to follow up with the dealership to find out the status of my registration. On February, 2017, the sales person emailed me saying it was on it's way. After this date, the sales person stopped taking my calls, answering my emails and the manager also refused to call me back. On March, 2017, at 10am, I saw my vehicle was hit over the weekend in the spot where it was parked on the street and I had to call the police. When the police came, it was brought to my attention that the registration was expired and the vehicle was not be driven. In addition, the VIN was not on record and the vehicle could not be found not under my name and or the dealership. The police asked me where I had gotten the vehicle because it's unusual for a vehicle not to show up once the VIN is run through their system. The police even asked me point blank if the vehicle was ""stolen!"" I called the dealership immediate. The receptionist stated that the sales person nor the manager were not available to speak to me and that I had to call back later. Even though, I told her the urgency of my issue and asked if there was anyone who could help me. She told me to call back. When I called back at 11:30am I spoke to the sales person and he had no response for me and stated he would get back to me. At 12:00pm the Manager called and said the registration would be mailed to me. With no clear timeline. It was already 3 business days past the expiration date. At this point, the dealership was in birch of the lease contract. In my frustration, I started to raise my voice at the manager he told me he didn't have to deal with me or my attitude. I asked him to please give me a timeline his response was 3 business days, that was March 6th. Today is March 10th and I still do not have my registration papers or plates for my vehicle. I have not called but I have emailed the sales person and he has not responded. I called Nissan Lease Corporation yesterday to find out what I could do. They sent me power of attorney to go get the vehicle registered on my own. Although, this seems as if this is my only option at this point I will have to pay for the registration for this vehicle, a service I have paid the dealership to provide. All I want is my plates and registration paper. I cannot drive my vehicle unless I have these items."
91,3,"I bought a car from this company in Late March 2016. The car delivered on 4/16 and was not as described but after several weeks and doing my own work, it was rectified. there was an original issue of them charging me too much money for the DMV registration and that was rectified after 3 weeks...and 12 phone calls. This company was made aware 3 weeks ago that there was an overpayment of $1200 and that I was looking to get that money back. I have been given the runaround and delayed and hung up on several times in trying to get this money back. I have been transferred to 2 different people that are constantly telling me that whoever i need to speak to is not there or they will take a message and that person never calls back. This has been going on for almost a month now. They are deliberately holding my money for no reason other than they can. I have spoken to Roy (original salesman who sold me the car), Lenny (alleged manager/supervisor who did not exist for 2 weeks as he was constantly on vacation) and told to speak to Doris (head of accounting who is never in the office or on the phone and will call me back and never does). I just want my $1200 back. I will have to go to small claims court next if this is not taken care of and I'd rather not do that if possible. Thank you for your help."
92,1,"I was referred by to this company. I am extremely upset. After I was called by phone, and told to go to the office to pick a car up, they made me wait 4 hours, and no car was rented to me. One individual kept telling in English to wait few minutes, and the same time another individual was telling everybody else in Spanish that have no cars available. I left after over four hours waiting. I came back a week later, I was the first person in the office. I filled out the form, and I was told to wait. I was the first customer in line. After waiting 3 hours, they have one car available. However, they ignored me, bypassed the online form (attendance list), and gave the car to somebody else, who showed about hour and half later than me. Then, they guy without even looking at me, told me that they did not have cars available, and told me to wait. Seriously...? I just left without saying a word. I will never go back there. I will tell all my friends not do business with this company."
93,1,"I wish I could give them NO stars, because they don't even deserve that one. I submitted my paperwork for a rental. I sent my sales rep, Jorey, an e-mail with some necessary information.

94,1,"On November 2014, I went into a lease contract with Tower Auto Mall on a 2014 Toyota Camry SE which was supposed to last 3 years and a half for the exorbitant amount of $369/week. I was told that if I was allowed 2 weeks/year vacation. Those weeks will be added back to the end of the contract and would not be charged until after they were added to the contract at the end. 1) As per the clauses on the contract, on September, 2016, I returned the car to the Tower office in the Bronx and picked it up on the 26 of the same month. Tower refuses to stop charging me for the week I did not work while they still moved that week to the end of the contract. That constituted a breach of the contract which nullifies automatically. I tried for about a month to have them resolved this and each time I was told that it will be resolved and I will not be charged for the following week. But, continues to charge the $369/week as per Tower request. 2) I returned the car to Tower on October, 2016. I spoke with Nick. He did not know what to do and consult with another guy as to how to proceed. Contrarily as to what I was told when entering into the lease contract, they want to charge me a whopping amount of $2,500 if I did not want to keep the car. I was told (verbally) back in November 2014 that if I keep the car for over 6 months, I would not be charged or the most charge I can be responsible for is $1,000. 3) I believe that Tower has been scamming poor drivers for a while. They say one thing to get people to enter leases and they do a different thing. Like the story, they believe they can do everything they feel like and overcharge anyone that leases cars from them. I feel that my lease contract with Tower was automatically terminated when they decide to double charge me for that week they had the car in their lot while I was on vacation. By violating one clause of the lease, Tower nullified the contract when decided not to honor the contract mentioned above. To other drivers, be very careful when dealing with Tower Auto Mall Livery Center."
95,3,Okay so i apply with this auto mall in Long Island city about 2 months they promised to help you get a vehicle and get you on the road in 2 weeks they take all your private info social security address and name everything that they could get from you to verify that you are the person and still haven't contacted me or even sent me a email to let me know my status and so I have been calling them for about a month and half now and get hung up on and no straight forward answer I don't agree with the way they do business and don't understand what kind of business they are running at all please help.
96,3,"On November 7, 2017, I purchased a new Volkswagen Atlas SEL 4Motion from Volkswagen of Union with trade-in of my Land Rover Discovery Sport. The sales experience was good on that day, and I am happy with the new vehicle I purchased. However, about 3 weeks later, I noticed that the new car's registration sticker still not come, and my trade-in's loan balance were not paid off by the dealership as stated in the Sales Contract. I called and they told me that they have 30-days to pay off the loan (NJ legislation required the dealers to pay off loans on trade-ins within 15 days of acquiring them (A4980)). As off today (12/4/17), my loan balance still remains, and my new registration sticker still not show up in my mailbox. I contracted the sales manager and he said he will follow up with these issues. Let's hope that the dealership will do the right thing and result these matters in a timely manner."
97,1,"I purchased a Certified Pre-Owned 2011 Volkswagen Jetta SE from Union Volkswagen in 2014, and when I went to trade it in, I was only offered $4,300 for my car, which only has 48,000 miles on it. When I looked at the CarFax, I saw that it had been sold to me after it had been in a collision with a utility pole, and the right airbag had been deployed. This dealership is washing their hands of the entire matter, saying that they are not responsible because they are the new owners. This was FRAUD and I am getting a lawyer against this shady dealership."
98,1,"I'm appalled at the sheer NEGLIGENCE of Lexus of Queens, whose mistakes put my family's LIFE AT RISK! We had our car serviced on 8 for a NY State Inspection as well as the replacement of 3 tires and standard alignment. The following day 8 we left for a 3 1/2 hour road trip with our 5 yr old daughter and 4 yr old son in the back seat. After the first hour, we started to notice a loud, frequent, thumping sound coming from the left front side of the car. This sound and the vibration associated with it, progressively got louder and louder to a point of concern. Due to our hyper-vigilance, we drove 15 miles off route to the nearest Lexus Dealership. Upon inspection, they informed us that the LUG NUTS were NEVER TIGHTENED to Lexus spec (see invoice from Lexus of Chester Springs). Due to the negligence of Lexus of Queens, we were told that our wheel had progressively been coming off the car and could eventually have completely fallen off while we were driving on the highway between 60-70 miles per hour. After spending hours on the phone with multiple employees at Lexus of Queens, including Brittany, Anna, Tricia, Andrew the Manager and Tim the General Manager, we were never given a formal apology of their CLEAR MISTAKE that could have left our family in a tragic situation. Both the Manager and General Manager started off their conversations with me saying ""if your lug nuts were actually loose, you wouldn't have been able to drive more than 3 blocks without your wheel falling off"". This comment made the whole situation seem like a coincidence. Only after outright requesting an apology, did Tim the General Manager simply repeat the apology we asked for and say that the lug nuts being loose was ""highly likely"" due to their error but ""anything is possible"". And in compensation for the sheer disrespect, rude, unapologetic, unprofessional and blame dodging behavior, this GM insulted us with offering a 4th free tire (which he admittedly stated we did NOT need to replace). So according to Lexus of Queens, the value of my family's life is worth 1 tire that retails for $275???? We did not buy a Lexus to deal with this NEGLIGENCE and UNPROFESSIONAL behavior. This is UNACCEPTABLE and ACTION needs to be taken. How would you feel to have this happen to your family? What form of compensation is even imaginable for having your family at risk?"
99,3,"I took my car to get serviced at Lexus of Queens 10//2015 and noticed a tear to the inside front passenger door after I picked it up. I returned a few days later, expecting like any good business, they would apologize for the damage and fix it. Instead, the service manager, Richard, denied they did it and refused to have anything to do with me."
100,1,"I have been going to this dealership for the past two years and every time I go they find a new problem with my vehicle that does not exist and if it does they do not repair it but they say that they do. For example, my Lexus vehicle was having issues with the alignment. I have been going multiple... times and they said they fixed it while they only fixed half of the problem (but charged me in full). This is severely dangerous because their lack of care to accurately checked my vehicle lead to the wearing down of my tires to the point that the rims shredded through the tires and my life was at risk with the causing of an accident if I was to hit one pot-hole (which in Queens is very likely). During my service appointment I expressed my concerns over the alignment and the salesman charged me $600 to service and fix the vehicle (which I later took to a second dealership whom another technician told me that noting was actually checked on my car). During the $600 service appointment, the sales man came out midway during the service and concluded I needed 4 thousand dollars to repair my vehicle for damages that didn’t exist. Suspiciously I turned it down, as I had a feeling he was lying to me to make a sale. One week later I took my vehicle to Lexus of (where I bought the vehicle and the technicians were appalled at the fact that my life was in severe danger because of the conditions of the wheels with the rims shredding through the tires. Not only that, but I gave them a summary copy of the so called “needed” $4,000 service and they were again shocked to see that none of that was actually needed. They also told me that in the $600 Service, nothing was done to my car. I demand my $600 back from the dealership and I have been calling but the manager of service keeps giving me the run-around. This is the only way I can find justice not only for myself but raise awareness for the thousands of other customers who go to this dealership. "
101,2,"I purchased a new trolley, Sunday October 22, 2017, at the international congress of esthetics and spa in Miami from the company flamingo beauty supply. I purchased it directly from Roberto, whom I was told is the manager. He personally promised me delivery (verbally and written on the receipt) of a new trolley the next day, Monday October, since they did not have any new ones in the box available to take home with me that day. The only trolley available was the used floor model. I said I would wait for Monday because I wanted a new, clean one. Monday, I called the office twice and no one answered, I could not leave a voice message since they didn't have one, and no one called me back or delivered the trolley. Tuesday, I had to call them 6 times before I was told that delivery can't happen this day either and to wait for Wednesday; 3 days passed promised delivery date. Wednesday, they delivered the used floor model trolley, not a new one in the box. It came covered in a black plastic trash bag. It has dents, scratches and dirty fingerprints everywhere. Wednesday, after my 5th call trying to reach Flamingo Beauty Supply, they promised that the driver will pick up the used trolley and deliver the new one on Thursday. After which, I explicitly requested them to deliver it by Thursday October 26, or issue me a refund if they cannot. It was getting ridiculously unprofessional. No one came on Thursday to deliver the proper trolley. No one called either. The new trolley did not arrive Thursday, and now they don't want to issue me a refund. They asked me to drive the old trolley down to their warehouse which I have never been to. I asked them to pick up the used trolley the same way they dropped it off since it was their mistake to begin with. They stopped responding to my requests. I even asked the to provide a return shipping label since they sent me the wrong item. However, they have stopped responding to all my customer service requests. I strongly regret doing business with them."
102,3,"I used Whittl to try and book services at a Chicago spa. When I made the appointments, Whittl immediately charged my debit card for $306 for services. Minutes later I received a call from the spa that Whittl was wrong and they did not have any availability and that my order would be cancelled with... Whittl Later that day when I looked at my bank account, I realized Whittl had charged my card $720 dollars in four different transactions. I called customer service immediately and they said they would try and resolve the situation, but it is now three days and a few voice mail messages later and I have not heard back from Whittl nor have I received a refund of the full amount."
103,2,"I was talked into doing the procedure cool sculpt at the end of July. I told the lady doing the consultation, that I was hesitant about the procedure and it was expensive. She told me they can get me approved right away and they did with. She verbally guaranteed me that the results would be great. I went in on 8-4-17 and not only was it painful, I had bruising for several months and its still itchy and very sensitive. The results are no different than before the treatment and I felt rushed during the treatment. My skin is actually saggy now in the area that was treated (bra area) both sides. They have pics on file. Now I am stuck with a high payment and I feel that I was talked into doing something I was not really comfortable with. This was a horrible decision and I will never go back. I have been very angry with the way they handled this. Poor service all around. They wanted me to do anther session and I said no way..."
104,3,"On 9/1/16, my son, was seen. Due to Wellfast being unable to verify his health insurance, I agreed to pay $80 with the understanding that they would process on insurance when available and provide a partial refund to me. On 9/9/16, I received health insurance details and provided... to Mallory in person, who was able to verify it over the phone immediately but said someone would have to get back to me about the refund. After not being contacted; I called on 9/13 & again on 9/15, was told the person I needed to talk to was not in so I left messages for Amber and the Manager to call me back. No one has returned my call."
105,3,I began a membership January 2017 and called in February and booked 3 appointments. I came in with my wife but was told because she is pregnant Massage Luxe could not provide service to her. I had hours available and called to cancelled but was told no refund was available.
106,2,"First, I'd like to point out that this was at the Massage Luxe in St.Charles, Mo off 5th street but there was no option for that so I clicked on the location that is listed as their world headquarters on google. I received a gift card to massage luxe for Christmas after requesting one from my... family. On 1/28/17, I redeemed my gift card. As I was about to leave they offered me a ""membership"". The girl told me it was only $10 to join and then there would be a monthly fee each month, BUT that the membership could be canceled ANYTIME. I explained that I would first have to speak to my husband before purchasing a membership and asked if I could come back up later that weekend to purchase if I decided to get it. She said that I would have to purchase it right then and there or I wouldn't have the opportunity to do so again as I wouldn't be considered a ""new"" customer anymore after I walked out the door. I again said I needed to speak with my husband first and if I couldn't do so then I would just pass on the membership. She then told me that I could go ahead and sign up, and if I changed my mind within 48 hours that I could come back up and get a refund for the $10. Furthermore, she told me after the 48 hours was up, that I wouldn't be able to receive the $10 back if I canceled, but I would be able to cancel ANYTIME as this was a month to month membership. I was reluctant but it seemed like a good deal and as a mother of five, I could benefit from a monthly massage, so I payed the $10. THREE separate times she reaffirmed that I could cancel at ANYTIME and I would only lose $10 if I canceled after the initial 48 hours. So a couple weeks or so goes by and circumstances in our home unexpectantly changed. My husband and I concluded that we could not keep this membership. So I called the location and the girl I spoke with said I needed to come in physically to cancel my membership. So two days later (Friday 2/24/17), I go to the physical location to cancel it. The girl working the desk enters my info in the computer. She then tells me there is some sort of error and she would have to have her manager cancel the membership when she came in the next day. She told me she was leaving a note for her manager about the problem and that I wanted to cancel and not be charged on the 28th. I asked her if I needed to do anything else and she informs me that her manager would take care of it and call me if they needed anything from me. So I assumed everything was taken care of. Then the morning of 2/28/17, my account was charged 58.88 for the membership. I called them and told them of the issue and the girl on the phone said she would have her manager call me back after she wasn't able to fix it. Two days later (3/1/17) the manager finally calls me back and tells me she can cancel my membership today, but she can not refund me the money I was overcharged. She says I signed a contract, but I did not. I signed a receipt that specifically says my membership is a month to month and I can cancel ANYTIME. I made multiple attempts to cancel my account BEFORE the billing date, and now that my account has been charged 58.88, they are basically telling me it's my loss. I WANT MY REFUND of $58.88 for services that I never received, nor wish to in the future after this nonsense."
107,2,"Went in to the st Charles MO location had massage time at 6 sat in the back for 15/20 min then massage was rushed since they closed at 7 and workers wanted to go home. Massage lasted 30min. Didn't feel relaxed Just rushed and when I spoke to the manager he was more concerned about getting us a... membership then our bad service, I was told the massage was 84$ which on the website clearly states 74$ So they are charging more then what they should. I paid 120$ for sitting and being rushed. I talked to and he said he would give us 50% our next massage? I'm unhappy with my service and what I paid and I don't want to go back and spend more money."
108,3,"I have paid for hours of service, the hours add up and accumulate. Massagelux got a new computer system and now state I have fewer hours I have called and emailed corporate. I received the same answer from the St. Charles office and corporate, We can't look at past history of month's prior. That's... hard to believe. I want August and September hours proof. They don't just drop off. They are supposed to accumulate. Stating updated computer systems, should be professional enough to provide customer proof they request."
109,2,"The week of 2/13 - 2/18/2017 I went into the Massage Luxe location in St. Charles, MO because I had a Massage Luxe gift card as well as a some generic massage gift cards which Massage Luxe accepts. The manager heard me talking to the rep at the front desk and came out to discuss some options with... me. The best option was to start a membership which would maximize the number of services I would get. I did have to give my debit card to initialize the service. The gift cards got me several service and got my account paid until 6/14/2017. During the transaction I told the manager I did not want to pay for services past what the gift cards would get me. She told me she understood and she put in my debit card and then after she got my account set up she told me she took my payment information out. I had my last appointment scheduled for 6/14/2017, unfortunately I wasn't going to make it so I called on 6/13/2017 to cancel that service. When I spoke with the representative she asked if I wanted to reschedule i said my account ends on 6/14 and she reviewed the account and agreed that my account was ending on 6/14/2017. I took that conversation as my account was showing cancelled. When I went to check my checking account in August my account had been charged a membership fee on 6/16, 7/16 and 8/16 in the amount of 58.88 each month. I called Massage Luxe on 8/22 and was explaining my situation to the rep and they where unable to assist me and took my name and number down and told me a manager would call me in the next day or so. By 9/8/2017 I still had not had a call and i sent a message via the Massage Luxe website to the st. Charles store reviewing the above. i have still not heard anything back and I am still being charged a monthly fee and need to get this resolved and refunded."
110,1,"I used this business after learning about it on Groupon. The owner was very personable and made me comfortable during the office visit. I also read 42 good reviews on Groupon. However, I failed to look for the basic signs of a reputable business and a professional. Despite all the warning signs hardly any before and after photos of her work, took her only 1 hour to performer the procedure while other professionals need 3 hours, never measured my eyebrows because apparently that is used only by people who don’t know how to do a proper microblading, never gave me printed instructions about after care and what she said verbally was opposite from all I read online, and many other signs). My eyebrows are uneven, opposite from the photo we agreed on, her work is terrible and it does not even resemble microblading. Instead of fine hair like strokes I have X signs on my eyebrows. My eyebrows are ruined, and it will take thousands to get this removed and corrected. Her advertising is for microblading, but she performed a different procedure. I payed for two services and she never gave me the receipt. Chased me out of her office saying that she has to keep her schedule. I have been trying to reach her for 4 days to ask for help and she is not responding. I payed for another appointment and she is not responding and refusing the service. She took payment for a follow up visit but refusing to respond. Too late for me now but I hope this complaint helps others. Also, I can provide copies of my messages which were sent to this business."
111,1,"This place is a scam. The doctor does not care about the patients. Horrible place, last doctor's office someone to visit. Went in for a physical charge for something different. Making up diagnosis without getting to know me. I came there without any complaints of any ailments and he decided to diagnose. He decided to charge me months after my visit because I refuse to return to his establishment."
112,2,"I received horrible customer service and was threatened with legal action by Cory if I did not delete a negative Yelp review. I was supposed to receive three sessions to camouflage a scar. The first session did not go well and my ""artist"" was not confident after the session. My second session was cancelled even though I didn't request it to be officially cancelled. At this point I asked for a full refund of my $1,850 on 12/15. I was told I'll receive a call on Monday 12/18. I did not receive a call on 12/18 and texted Cory about the status of my refund and he replied with a text I still have stating ""we can continue this conversation after you take down that yelp review you left I'm sitting next to my risk management and director of operations and they are making the phone to take legal actions about that if not taken down"". Again, I have this text saved. I received no call on Monday and no call today (12/19). I called the main line but they are no help. Cory also texted me ""it will be sooner than later I don't control that department but you calling leaving notes saying no will call you I am ignoring isn't going to help the cause, please be patient"". Help the cause? I'm just trying to get a refund and they are clearly delaying the process. I have both of these texts saved and in my opinion they are highly inappropriate and unprofessional."
113,1,"I have a credit of approximately $19.35. On the day that I got work done, it was my first time there & my daughter's first time there as well. I had paid for both of our services. I was supposed to get an underarm wax but, too shaved and that's how the credit came into to play. Now, I had wanted... to buy products and pay the difference with the $19+ and was told that I couldn’t, and they would just save it for the next time I come in. Well, since then, I had been talking to Cidney, Manager and she was going to give me 50% off & make it loke it was my first time coming in discount or refund me if I couldn't come in at all; just let her know when. But, this new MANAGER, TRACEY IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL & HAVE BEEN TRYING TO AVOID ME. I been told that they don't give refunds under $20, yet, I can buy products, get more work done (i.e. eyebrows done). I guess the rules have changed. This is very bad business!!! I'm just a few cents shy of $20 & you won't give me what's due to me!!! I don't want anything else there. I just want my money."
114,3,"I went to this location back in June 2015 for a promotion for your first wax being free. I had an amazing visit and ended up purchasing a package where I paid up front for 9 visits and received an additional 2 for free. When I had my second visit in August, my first one on the package, I did not... have a great experience. The waxing did not remove the hair properly, and I had hair growing back on my lip and brow in less than a weeks time. I called the store to complain, and I was told my next visit would be on them. I showed up for my third visit in September, this one free because of my previous complaint, and had the same issue again, where the hair follicles were broken above the skin and not completely waxed, and I pointed it out to my technician, Kim, while still in the chair. I was told ""Oh Well,"" by her and that was the end of our interaction. All three of these visits were spread out from June to September, about 6 weeks apart each. Immediately following my third visit when checking out, I asked to speak to the manager, Holly, however she was not on site. I left my information for her to contact me. After a week passed and I had not heard back, I started calling and leaving messages with the receptionist for the always unavailable manager about once a week, none to be returned. In early November, I reached out to European Wax Center Headquarters for help with my problem. I was responded to by email, which I still have, apologizing and saying someone from the location in question would be calling me to discuss my problem. After a week, I still heard nothing so I reached out again to Headquarters, with no reply this time. A few more weeks passed and my mother, who was also a client there, canceled her future appointments with them until my problem could be resolved. At that time a new manager Laurie gave my mother her name and number to call to talk to. I called later that day, but she was already gone. I followed up with a few more calls throughout the month of December, always having to leave messages with the receptionist. Not one call has been returned. I have paid at this point $208.19 for services that were never properly provided, and have attempted multiple times to solve this directly with the store."
115,2,"I went for a pedicure at the salon. The clerk was very rough on my ankle and skin was removed. She never apologized, only said (That must hurt). She proceeded to do it again. I called the salon owner to complain and get my money returned but she didn't care. Said I needed to contact for a... refund. My foot has been inflamed, I am on an antibiotic, and. Have trouble walking at times."
116,2,"Massage Envy was calling me a numerous time to try and update my billing information. I finally called them back and I spoke with Mario. I had told him that my husband has recently passed away and I can no longer afford to pay for the membership. Mario stated to me that was ok and all I needed to do...was to go in and sign a cancellation form. A couple days later, they called back and said they wanted to update the billing information. I called the office right away and asked to speak with the manager. She didn't sound apologetic and sympathetic. It is difficult enough to go through the loss of my husband and on top of that, I had to deal with the people who don’t communicate with staffs."
117,2,"In July of 2015 I signed up for a membership at Massage Envy. It was a year-long commitment and I was told when I signed up that it would not be a problem to cancel after the year was over. In June 2016 I contacted the Massage Envy in Tempe and told the person who answered that I wanted to cancel... my membership because I did not want it to continue for another year. She said that unless I actively renew my membership, it would automatically go into cancellation and I would not continue to be charged. In October I noticed on my bank statement that I was still being charged the monthly membership fee. I contacted the Tempe location again and the person said that I needed to cancel my account via email. She provided me an email address. I emailed that address saying that I wanted to cancel and wanted to be reimbursed for the few months that I had been charged. I never got a response from the email. In December I was charged again (and was for November as well) and I called and explained that I've been trying to cancel this membership and that I'd talked to two different people and got different answers and I sent an email and could my account please be cancelled and for me to be reimbursed. That person said they were cancelling my membership that day and would have a district manager follow up with me about reimbursement. I never heard from a district manager and continue to be charged a monthly membership fee."
118,2,"I found this ""company"" through Groupon. I made an appointment for 0930 on Thursday December 29. I called the telephone number on the website at 0914 to ask where exactly the shop was, because my GPS showed the salon was supposed to be a run-down stucco building on a corner with bars on the windows… a chained door and no signage at all. Sure enough, that was the building. I parked my car in front of this building and went up to the door that was chained. There was no way to get in, and no one answered the door bell. After 5 minutes, a white truck drove up and a female got out of the passenger side. She went up to the door, unlocked it and did not introduce herself. She walked past me, I smelled marijuana. Only when I said ""hi, I have an appointment at 0930"" did she acknowledge me. She said ""well I have an appointment before you so you can wait till 945 or 1000"". I told her I was uncomfortable with your attitude and uncomfortable with the bad area/neighborhood the ""salon"", you smell like pot and I am leaving and not coming back at 0945 or 1000. I immediately called Groupon and explained the situation to them. They refunded my money immediately and said that they were going to investigate the issue and see if this ""company"" should continue advertising on their website. Later in the afternoon I had a 59$ charge on my credit card for that company. I called the number listed on the website at 1249 and told the woman that answered what had happened. She apologized profusely and said that she would call the billing company and have them call back after they took care of the charge. I received a call at 8:07pm from a woman that said she was the person I was supposed to have my appointment with this morning. She stated ""baby I'm the owner"" when I asked to speak with the owner and not her. During the 9-minute conversation she said: ""what does it matter I smell like pot""; ""I'm going to get your money anyway so it doesn't matter»; «you can't report me, you can't call the cops or owner cause I am it""; ""."
119,2,I went to the location a year ago used a gift card to pay for the massage and cash to tip. I am NOT a member to any massage envy or have stepped foot in one for a massage since. A year later my credit card was manually put into massage file and I was charged the $65. I went up there in person the manager called the owners and who brushed it off offered no explaining.
120,2,"I was forced to pay an unauthorized non-contractual additional monthly fee upon request to cancel membership. On 7/27/2016, I signed a standard contract to freeze my membership so that I could use my accrued credits for 6 months. Was the manager who helped explain how to enact this service, which was paid up front. The ""freeze-plus"" service ended on 1/27/2017.I requested to cancel my membership on 1/25/2017. The freeze-plus agreement stipulates:""I further acknowledge and agree that on the next scheduled data after the Freeze Plus period expires, my credit card will be automatically charged in the amount of money and will continue to be automatically charged monthly thereafter for all future payments due under my Wellness Agreement"". I never received a signed copy of the agreement or the amount that would be charged had I wished to continue my membership. Mrs. (named above) assured me that I could cancel before my next scheduled monthly payment on 2/12/2017.The form for cancellation stipulates the following in regards to payment:""Any payment due prior to the Cancellation Effective Date may be charged by us as scheduled.""Given I requested cancellation on the 1/25/2017, and it takes 10 days to process the cancellation, the effective date of cancellation is 2/4/2017, which is before my next payment. I was not allowed to cancel unless I paid the new membership rate of $65.00.As of July of 2016, the membership rate was $54.99, and I did not receive notice of the new membership rate. Therefore, I am being forced to pay an additional $65.00 in order to cancel my membership. This fee was not stipulated in the contract, nor was it explained to me by Mrs. I was told, one of the store managers, that Mrs. is no longer employed by Massage Envy.Explained to me that if I did not pay the $65.00, they would continue to charge my account, as I would be forced to remain a member. Additionally, if I placed a stop payment on the card, on file, they (i.e., Massage Envy) would report due payment to a collections agency.Although I do not agree with the additional fee (of $65), I chose to pay lest I be forced into a continued membership against my will for unwanted services. I requested that Massage Envy provide a written statement agreeing to allow me to cancel my membership upon payment of the $65 fee."
121,2,"Massage Envy was told to CANCEL MEMBERSHIP due to their lying & providing poor customer service - they billed my account anyway I was going to this location for several months. Being physically disabled I needed a therapist sensitive to my needs. I was going 1x to 2x a month always seeing. When I was last there I was told that she would be on vacation for several weeks. I did not want to work with anyone else so I made an appointment w her when she returned. On the night before my appointment they called & confirmed my appointment with. My appointment was at 1pm. No one made any attempt to contact me all morning to tell me that was not coming in. When I arrived for my appointment expecting to see that was when I found out she was not in. Rescheduling with was not an option because they said there computers were not working. They did say if I waited a bit someone else could see me. I did not want to see anyone else if I was willing to see someone else I would not have waited for to return from vacation. After I left this business & did not receive services I immediately called the corporate office. I received a voicemail & left a message. I spoke to someone at this location a couple days later & told them to CANCEL MY MEMBERSHIP I was going to receive PROFESSIONAL MASSAGE SERVICES at HOSPITAL. They would not let me speak to the manager & said the manager would call me - to date she has not. I have left numerous voicemail messages at the corporate office - no one returns my calls. I have sent emails through & through to BOTH the corporate office & this location & NO ONE WILL GET BACK TO ME. In each email they were told CANCEL MY MEMBERSHIP DO NOT BILL ME FURTHER FOR SERVICES. I paid $59 at the beginning of Aug. & DID NOT receive any services then after being told NOT to bill me further they again billed me on Sept. 6. I am disabled & on a fixed income this is almost $120 I paid for services I DID NOT receive & do not want to receive. I have notified my bank NOT to accept any more payments from them. However, if Massage Envy submits for payment in the future & my bank REFUSES PAYMENTS as I have instructed them to do I will have to pay a $31 STOP PAYMENT FEE. This place is poorly managed & unprofessional. I had an opportunity to see another doctor on the day I was scheduled for the massage. According to their rules it was TOO LATE to cancel the appointment so rather than go to the doctor I went for the massage only to find out that the person I was scheduled to see & who they confirmed the night before that I would be seeing was not there. Furthermore, they could not tell me when would return or make a different appointment with her because they claimed that there computers were broken. Given my numerous medical conditions I feel the best thing is to cut all ties with Massage Envy & go see a Medical Professional Massage Therapist at Hospital."
122,1,"Bad business practices I have been a member of Massage Envy for over two years. In 2014 I was laid off from my job and was unable to pay the monthly fee of $49 dollars. This was the monthly membership fee at the time I became a member. I froze my account for six months and paid $240 dollars to bring my account up to date. Due to my job situation and change in my economic status I completed a form to cancel my membership in May 2016. However, before I submitted my cancelation form my account was debited $59 dollars. I called Massage Envy to find out why the membership fee was now $59 dollars and why I never received any correspondence stating that the membership fees had increased. This further confirmed my decision to cancel my membership. The representative I spoke with emailed me the cancelation form and informed me that I had five pre-paid massages that I needed to use within 60 days of my cancelation notice. Again, I never received any correspondence from Massage Envy to confirm receipt of my form. I called the company on June 2nd to inquire if my form was received and processed. I was told by an employee named that the manager was not in but he would leave a note for the manager to go through the cancelation forms on June 3rd and give me a call. However, he never asked for my name or phone number. I had to ask him if he was going to take my name and number so the manager would know to contact me. I then proceeded to ask about making an appointment so that I could use my pre-paid massages and he then informed me that my account has been suspended for non-payment. I told him that I submitted a cancelation for a month ago and that was no fault of mine. I was then told that I could not make an appointment because my account was suspended for non-payment and that I could not cancel my membership unless I received a note from my doctor stating that I can no longer receive massages or if I move 25 miles away from the location. Proceeded to say that this information should have been communicated to me at the time I became a member. This information was NEVER communicated to me the same way I never received communication about the membership increase and I never received ANY communication whether or not my cancelation form was received. Again, I had to call them. I am angry that I have been a member for as long as I have and received this type of service. This is not the first time I have complained about the services provided. Past complaints have been reported to the corporate office. Bottom line, I should be able to use the existing pre-paids that I have paid for and cancel my membership with Massage Envy. As far as I am concerned any agreement that I signed when I became a member at $49 dollars a month was breached the moment $59 dollars was withdrawn from my account because that is not what I signed up for nor did I ever receive any notification stating this change or sign anything agreeing to that change. Based on my experience with Massage Envy I would not recommend them to anyone."
123,2,"I purchased a short-term membership that I pre-paid for. It was due to end in March 2016. They continued to charge me $59.99/mo. I signed the contact with them under member number. The contract ended on 3/14/2016. While the standard contract has the phrase ""and thereafter is auto renewable"", this phrase was struck from the contract that I signed. Nonetheless, they continued to charge me $59.99 per month for April and May 2016. I called on 5/19/2016 to end the charges and have the April and May charges rescinded. The person taking the call offered to send a cancellation document (which I have not yet received) and would not rescind the fees."
124,2,"Multiple attempts to cancel monthly subscription have failed. First signed up for a Massage Envy ""membership"" program in Aurora, CO location. Upon moving to NC in early 2016, decided to cancel the (contactless) subscription. Went in to physical location in Durham, NC, to start cancellation process; employee claims they ""cannot find me in the computer system"". Monthly charges continue. I call the Aurora, CO, location to cancel; THAT employee tells me that my cancellation has gone through this time, and ""I'm all set"". Monthly charges continue, and increase by $5 per month. I then contact the bank that issued the credit card that Massage Envy has been charging to, file a formal inquiry and ask for a halt on any charges from that company in the future; complaint filed successfully (via Bank). About 2 weeks later, receive mail from bank that states that the matter has been investigated and RESOLVED. I am refunded the past 3 months of charges from Massage Envy....and yet I am STILL getting charged monthly by the company. On months that the charge doesn't go through, they charge me double the next month. I have called their stores and general customer service line over 9 times.Each and every time, an employee tells me either:""They can't find me in the system, how strange"", or they take my information and ""register my cancellation"", claiming that I am now canceled.I have not used any services from Massage Envy since late 2015, but I have been charged by them every single month since, despite multiple attempts to cancel. $60, then later $65 per month.Absolutely unacceptable and weird."
125,2,"I sent a formal cancelation form in January, however they kept charging my account and will not provide me a proper refund of my money. I completed the formal cancellation process with Massage Envy in January. After receiving their cancellation form via email, I filled it out and emailed it to the address indicated on the form. I still have the original form and email with a time stamp marked for January 10, 2017. According to their cancellation policy indicated on the form, my cancellation would be effective 10 days after sending the form, meaning January 20, 2017. Unbeknownst to me, massage envy continued to draft monthly dues out of my account until June. When I got in contact with them to resolve the issue, they claimed to not have ever received my form. I then forwarded them the original email with the time-stamped date, and they said the manager would get in contact. The manager called back and said that they came under new ownership in June so they would only be able to refund the June payment, and allow me to use my accrued massages. I responded that it was not any fault of mine that the form went unnoticed and there was a change in ownership. I followed the formal steps for a cancellation so I would need a full refund of the monthly payments that were taken out after my cancellation was in effect. The manager responded by saying he would speak to the owner and come up with a conclusion. The manager called back a couple days later after speaking to the owner and repeated the same solution he previously stated. This has been very stressful and not handled adequately. There should be no reason that a client is penalized for errors made on the part of the business. Especially with the original email and time-stamped date, the solution of only a June refund is hardly a resolution at all."
126,3,"Returned item. Did not receive refund requested. No communication from business received.Ordered a CD player for our car. $65.00 Received and saw that it would not fit the space.

We will honor refund or replacement requests that occur within 30 days after delivery of the item and will refund or replace within 7 days. Buyers will receive 100% refunds. I contacted them twice about a return, and finally received the below response refusing to pay for the return. They need to honor what they have in writing and pay for the return, and issue a FULL refund."
128,2,"Intepost Solutions advertised a drone on the Facebook site. It was a good-sized drone with a control box that also showed a camera monitor. It was supposedly worth $299.00 and it was being sold for $78.95. I ordered it on May 29,2018 and received it on July 13, 2018 but, the drone was not the... one that was advertised on the Facebook site. Maybe worth $25.00 and not $78.95 and far from $299.00 My shipment was a mini version of the one advertised and has no camera or, monitor."
129,2,"The product was received dead on arrival. When I called, I was informed that my only option was to attempt using batteries.I purchased the mp3/cd player from Amazon.com on Tuesday, September 1. It arrived Tuesday, September 8.Upon receiving and un-boxing it, I followed the directions to test it in my nursery (I am pregnant and due in two days). I plugged in the AC cord as per the instruction booklet, and the power indicator light did not come on. I tried 3 other outlets in 3 other rooms (these had computers and other electronics plugged in, so I know the outlets were not faulty). Therefore, the product was defective on arrival.I called the NAXA support number to begin the process of a return. The representative I spoke with told me the only option I had was to power it with 8 C batteries. Had I desired a battery-powered product, I would have purchased one. However, I purchased the NPB-250 because it was AC powered. The representative (I believe her name was) told me my only option was to contact the seller. Thank goodness I had purchased the cd/mp3 player from Amazon, because otherwise I would not have been able to purchase a CD player for the nursery. "
130,1,"I guess you could ask ""How can she review something she still hasn't received?"" That's a very good question, but since we still haven't received all the parts and pieces for this order, which we had been told was complete and had all parts, nor have we received the shipping information we were told we would get, and I was told by customer service that ""when you receive the parts, you will keep the equipment"", when I asked for an RMA, I can only say this has been one of the worst experiences I have had with a supplier. We placed our order on June 28, began trying to get all the parts that weren't sent in the shipment on July 9th, and on July 17th, still don't have everything. I also asked to speak directly with the owner, and have been diverted at every request, so I can only assume Dina Beladi supports this kind of response from her company."
131,2,"I sent the item back, although later than they would like. They would not accept the item. I've paid $420.00 in shipping fees plus $690.90 for the item. They were to charge a 25% restocking fee but now will pay me nothing. They offered me $100 credited back to my card but I told them wasn't good...enough. Also, when I purchased this item online the website calculated the shipping charge as $12.00 or $15.00. SPW contacted me and informed me that there was a problem with their site and that due to the weight of the item, 300lbs. the freight charges would be much more, $212.00. I graciously understood and paid the extra fee. Wish I would have cancelled the order at that time. They should know how heavy an item is and be able to properly calculate the shipping when listing on their website."
132,3,"I purchased a cell phone from this company. The first phone they sent me, the internet kept dropping in and out. They exchanged the first phone, but it happened again on the second one they sent me. With both phones, I had T-Mobile, SW Bell, and Samsung all tried to help troubleshoot the issue... and no one could figure it out. I sent several emails and called several times. They never answer their phone, even though they have business hours listed online and their voice mail is not set up. They would not call me, even though I requested they do that via email. They attempted to get me to send the phone in for trouble shooting, but wanted me to send my SIM card in with it, which is impossible as I can't be without a cell phone while they are trouble shooting it. All I asked for was them to call me and help me trouble shoot over the phone, but they wouldn't call me."

134,3,"I used Puls originally on May 13th 2018 for a broken phone screen. The tech came to my home and replace my screen within a hour, hour and a half of me making the call. When the tech finishes the service he demonstrated how the phone is in working condition, he has you make a call, try to type... on your screen and so forth. He also shows the camera and how it works as well. He turned on the front facing camera, then flipped it to the back facing camera. The tech only shows that the camera works at no point did I take a picture. My original problem was only with my front screen there is zero damage to the back of the phone what so ever. There is no damage to my back camera. Later in the week when I tried to take a picture with my back facing camera, I notice that the camera doesn’t focus I literally have to tap my screen repeatedly to make the camera focus. Prior to the repair the tech examined my phone for any other damage and there was zero. This has only been happening since I’ve had my screen replaced. I contacted Puls’s customer service department Sunday May the 20th 2018, they then sent me a what they called a Guarantee Form to my email and said that a person from that department would get back to me within 24 hours. Later in the day I received a email reply from stating the following, Hello, Thank you for submitting your Guarantee request. We apologize that your device is experiencing complications following our services. We honor a lifetime guarantee on our parts that were used on your device and our installation as well. At this time, we are unable to correlate the issue that you are experiencing with our completed repair. However, we sincerely care about all of our customers' devices and want to help. We are pleased to share that we would like to offer you a $20 discount towards the necessary repair. If you would like to move forward at this time, please let us know and we will be happy to further diagnose the issue. I paid for the company to fix one thing and they broke another. Before they replaced my screen the company took note of any other damage to my device and there was absolutely nothing. Their response to the issues they caused was to offer to give me a discount to pay for their mistake."
135,3,"I used Puls service in Philadelphia, PA to replace the battery in my iPhone 7 on 12/17/2017. During this battery replacement, the technician cut a critical wire for my screen. This technician then went on to replace my screen. The issue is that Puls does not use the same Apple iPhone 7 screen, the... colors are different from the original Apple iPhone 7 screen. I pointed this out that 1) I did not want a screen replacement but since their technician damaged my phone, I had to get their screen replacement from a 3rd party screen & 2) The 3rd party screen has colors that are 'off' and different from the original screen than I had. They sent another technician on 01/07/2018 to replace the 3rd party screen with another 3rd party screen. The colors are still off and it was even noted by the technician during that visit that the colors are not right. The issues I’m having are that the screen replacement voids my warranty with T-mobile, so it renders my phone unable to be traded in. This was not an issue I was anticipating & I have lost all value in my current phone because of a mistake by a Puls technician on 12/17/2017 in cutting the screen wire."
136,1,"I wanted to report an incident which I believe is a symptom of a very bad business practice by Puls Technologies Inc. and I hope you would certainly review and prevent such questionable practice. I requested a iPhone screen repair service with Puls Technologies Inc that was not delivered as... promised. Their technician told that he did not have proper tools, he suggested that I should go to store where he told that they would be able to replace the screen easily, and did not complete the iPhone screen repair as was expected, he did not repair and left. After all that, Puls Technologies Inc support team contacted claiming wrongly a defective product and want payment for a diagnostic service that I did not request, and further threatened with a collection notice even when I explained that service was not completed as promised. I hope you will look into this unreasonable practice of not disclosing before that they would demand fees even if their technicians fail to deliver the service, and that they would demand a payment for a service for false diagnosis that they make up, demand fees that they do not disclose at the time of requesting service. I saw many advertisements on TV about their service and thought that they have a legitimate business, and am certainly disappointed that their service feels like a scam after trying for the very first time. I hope other consumers are similarly not being taken advantage of demanding undisclosed, questionable service fees. I have submitted a FTC consumer complaint for questionable business practice, reference number, and I hope many innocent consumers will not be taken advantage by your questionable business practice like this in the future."
137,1,"Was quoted $109 per TV for installation x2 TVs=$218 Eventually was charged $536, more than DOUBLE the quoted amount. Not only that but glitch with their payment system resulted in them billing the ridiculously inflated amount on a second card. So now I've been charged $1076 for what i anticipated... would be a $218 job based on their quote. When i called to complain their response was, ""sorry we can't help you"" Actually they pretended to respond by saying they'd get a supervisor to respond. The supervisor, who sounded quite similar to the first guy, also stated, ""sorry we can't help you"" Wish I'd never heard of this company.... Still trying to undo what feels like a figurative mugging by this company."
138,2,"My iPhone screen stopped working and went black, indicating a backlight/LCD screen issue. I looked online for a repair shop in LA where I was staying and found Puls who claimed they can come to me to repair my phone -- no details regarding which types of repairs they do or don't do. Technician... arrives LATE, opens up my phone, and proceeds to tell me he can't fix it but can't accurately explain why because he doesn't speak English fluently. Then charges me $39 and leaves me with a form saying he fixed my device. I contact email support for Puls who explain that Puls technicians can't do LCD repairs, period. If I had known that, I never would have made a reservation and had a technician come. Nowhere on the site does it explain that, and I had also indicated in my ORIGINAL request to the company that the device issue was related to the LCD screen, so they should have rejected my request and directed me elsewhere instead of sending a technician knowing he wouldn't be able to fix it and would charge me for the visit."
139,3,"I preordered my Chronos on 5/24/16 from their website and was charged in full on that date. After numerous product delays, I finally received my Chronos on 11/21/16 (this is the date I consider my one year warranty to have commenced). The product worked, more or less, as advertised for 6 months; but... on 6/1/17 the back panel of the device fell off. This panel is not supposed to be removable and would not stay back in place, without this panel the device is uncomfortable to wear and will not charge. I immediately emailed Chronos Wearables and was very pleased when they responded in less than 30 minutes and sent me a return label. Approximately a week later I received a brand new Chronos device. Unfortunately, after using the new device for only 8 days the same thing happened. I emailed them on 6/17/17, and this time it took them 4 days to reply. In this reply dated 6/21/17 they did offer to replace my device and admitted to a known defect causing the back to fall off. ""Please rest assured we are actively working with our manufacturer to remedy this bottom plate defect as soon as possible as we definitely want to build a long-lasting product for our customers. It is certainly not our goal to further burden you with the task of receiving replacements repeatedly. To be completely transparent, we are noticing that some units in our current batch seems to be facing the same issue, which is definitely frustrating. We are awaiting a new shipment from our manufacturers in a few weeks which will ideally contain remedied units."" Although I was not entirely pleased that I would have to wait a few weeks for my replacement, the explanation of needing to wait for a new batch to be made without the known defect made sense. It ended up taking more than a few weeks and I sent a follow up email to which they replied they were still working on getting reliable and defect free units in stock. On 8/27/17, two months after my second defective device failed, I received a replacement unit. I was very surprised that after waiting for several months for a unit from the new batch with the defect remedied, that I was sent a refurbished unit. I understand that per the warranty this is an option, however I was led to believe I was waiting for a new unit. I emailed Chronos Wearables to express my dissatisfaction with receiving a refurbished unit and to ask specifically about the warranty conditions regarding the refurbished device. Over a week went by and I resent my email on 9/5/17, I never received a reply. This brings us to the present, where on 1/4/18 the back panel of my refurbished unit fell off. I sent Chronos Wearables an email on 1/4/18 and again on 1/10/18 and have not received a reply. It seems to me that this defect is a known design flaw and the delay in sending me the refurbished unit was a strategic and deliberate attempt to ensure that my warranty would expire before the back panel inevitably fell off again. If it was their intent to send me a refurbished unit, why did I need to wait for a new batch to be manufactured? I also find it suspicious that the refurbished unit arrived on a date that the 90-day warranty on the replacement and my original 1-year warranty would both expire at approximately the same time. The fact that a company that had always been very responsive, sometimes replying in under 30 minutes, is suddenly refusing to reply to multiple emails only strengthens my suspicion. If the two-month delay in which I was waiting for my second replacement and I was without the product in my possession is removed from the timeline, my one year warranty would still be in effect."

After 8 months of regular use, the casing separated from the main body of the device. As it was still under warrant I reported this issue to... Chronos Wearable customer support. They responded saying ""Chronos comes with a full 1-year warranty. We'll be happy to send a replacement. Before we do so, we will need to receive your defective unit. Kindly provide us with the following details so we can send an electronic return label"" I promptly replayed with the details as requested but have not received any further instructions. I have emailed them 3 more times and not had any responses. I have done some further research and found many customers are having the same or similar issues with the product and customer services. "

Two years later, I'm ready to the machine to the street. Forget sheets and bedding. The agitator wraps them so tight that I almost rip the cloths/sheets to unravel.

145,3,"I purchased a refurbished Apple iPad Mini 2 off of the tekgalore.xyz website on December 13, 2017. I was immediately charged the $99.95 to my checking account. Roughly a week later I received a confirmation that the order had been processed and shipped, with a Tracking number (which I cannot...attach as it is rendering as a credit card number for some reason). After a few days, the package was attempted to be delivered to an address in Massachusetts. After a few delivery attempts, it was then returned to the sender address in Denver, Colorado. I called to confirm the address on the package, and was told the address on the shipping label was not remotely close to the correct delivery address. I have emailed the company at their service address info@tekgalore.xyz multiple times, with only one response ""I will check on this"". I have also called and left messages, as well as texted the service number and have yet to receive any response on the issue."
146,3,Wow I wish I had seen these reviews as well. They originally quoted my trade in as 115.00 and then said they would only pay 35.00 once they received my computer. They said it was not working and it was working fine the day I sent it. And it was well packaged in the materials they sent for shipping. I hope Apple will take a look at having them as their trade-in partner!
147,1,"Wish I had read these reviews before sending in my MacBook Air. However, since Apple was recommending them, I thought they would be fine. Like most people who left negative reviews, I too sent in my fully functional laptop. When they received it, they said the trackpad was not working, and changed the trade-in quote to $0. Strange, because the computer had been working fine until they got it. In any case, I wanted to get it back to sell to a more reliable and trustworthy company. However, they shipped it back to me using with a direct signature requirement, and no option to hold at a local store/hub. I like most people, work during the day and therefore cannot be home to sign. I tried calling, and asked them to hold it at a location near me (as I had done in the past), so I could go pick it up and sign. However, advised me the sender (Phobio) specifically requested that such an option NOT be available. I contacted Phobio, and they advised me that after the final (third) delivery attempt, it would be shipped back to them, and at that point they would ship it back to me, to be held at a location. Tried delivering it three time, and the status is now ""no further deliveries pending"" meaning it's hanging out somewhere (not heading back to Phobio and not being delivered to me). Phobio has also stopped replying to my emails. So now I am left with no money and no computer, and no way of getting it back (at least not any time soon). I implore everyone considering this company to do your research (100% negative reviews on BBB is really saying something!) and go elsewhere."
148,1,"Please do not use this company as way to trade-in/recycle your Apple product. I submitted a rather old Mac laptop for which I was quoted $40. In return, I received zero dollars and a broken Mac which is now worth nothing. My Mac was not cracked when I sent it to them. The return of damaged goods is on top of multiple shipping delays. Oddly, Phobio was rated as ""C+"" last week but is now at an A+. Do not use this company. Bring Apple products to your local Apple store of third-party. (I did, however, find Phobio's customer service to be friendly, that deserves one star)."
149,1,"I wish I had read these reviews before I sent them my computer. I sent them my four year old IMAC desktop a few weeks ago. It was in mint condition. I erased the HD and reinstalled the latest operating system myself. I mailed in my wireless keyboard and mouse as well. They initially offered $340 for my computer, then claimed that it had damage to the screen (which I do not believe was there when I sent them the computer as it never left my desk in four years). They reduced the offer to $90. I said return the computer to me. It took weeks to get it back, and when it did I was not sure it was my computer. Now it would not even boot up and they neglected to return my keyboard and mouse. I called and complained and they sent me a keyboard and mouse, but the mouse was broken. I agree with the negative reviews of this company. It is a bait and switch operation that seems to be doing some very questionable and unethical business practices. Better you sell you devices on your own or gift them to a charity."
150,1,"COMPLETE SCAM! ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGED WITH THIS SERVICE! I sent my computer back in perfect condition with this service! they write back they instead of the original $215 they will give me $40 because there is damage. The picture is of a dent in the corner of a computer. Completely ambiguous could be any computer. I know for a fact mine was not damaged! So either it was damaged in transit, they physically damaged it themselves, or it is a picture of another damaged computer. Completely disgraceful service."
151,3,"In September 2016, as my family and I were preparing for a move from Manhattan to Chapel Hill, NC. I decided that it would be best to digitize my music collection which consisted of 250-300 cd's. I then contacted Mr. Kris who said that he would be happy to assist me. He said that I would have... to bring my collection to him even though the company advertises home pick-up. I then rented a car and traveled the short trip to company's Long Island City HQ. The owner/CEO met me at the loading dock. After looking over my collection, he then agreed to take the entire collection. He indicated that he would digitize the entire collection I had, send me the Gmail file link via email and then mail me a hard copy of the files. After about a month or so and several phone calls and emails, he finally processed my order and digitized the CDs. He eventually posted the files on Gmail for my access as promised but didn't indicate how long the files would be available online. He said that he hadn't sent the back up copy complaining that he didn't have the staff to do that. After about a month or so, I was surprised to find out that the files were no longer active. I then reached out to Mr. who seemed surprised that I hadn't downloaded the files. After informing him that I had been busy with my move, I kindly asked him to repost the link and send me the hard copy DVD. By this point it was already February 2017. After not receiving either file and/or any follow up, I then contacted Mr. and asked him where my stuff was. He then said that he forgot, but that this request would have to wait since he was too busy to help me as he was preparing for a move. He then asked me to follow up in mid-May after the move and he said he would try to help then. I did as he asked and then was told to follow up again in 10 days because he was still unpacking boxes. After another email and no response (as of June) I'm now filing this complaint in order for this company to follow through on it's service."

I JUST WANT MY MONEY BACK."
153,2,"I bought my Cabrio Platinum Washer and Dryer in 2013 (4 years old). About a month ago, it started sounding like an airplane was landing in the house while on spin cycle. I called a repairman and he said the bearings were going bad and it would be better to buy a new machine. When we pulled out the washer, there was grease all over the floor - apparently a seal started leaking and the bearings had no grease so they started burning up. I talked with Whirlpool, after all it was only 4 years old and a seal leaking and burning the bearings up wouldn't be from normal wear. They were not convinced and offered to give me a discount on a new one -- No Way! I went with another brand recommended by the repairman. The screws on the dryer door also came out and we had to replace them. So much for the Whirlpool brand and especially their top of the line machines. I will not buy another Whirlpool washer or dryer."
154,2,"I ordered cassette tapes from moodies records, that were to be sent to westchester correctional facility. The jail did receive them, but sent them straight back to moodies records unopened. They never even opened the package because they said that they no longer accept anything from moodies because... he has sent in illegal bootleg cassette tapes in the past. I called moodies and moody himself informed that he did receive the returned package, but to give him a few days because he was having his lawyer look into it. After about a week I still had not heard from hi, so I called him back and he asked me what did I want him to do and I informed him that's I expected to receive a full refund and he agreed. He told me that he was going to be sending me a money order with the full refund in the amount of $175. After a week I still didn't gets the money order so I called him and again he said that he would be sending it out the following day. Another week goes by and still nothing. I continued to call from my phone and was not getting an answer, I then used a friends phone to call and he answered and I heard moody ask what did the caller ID say, so he obviously was screening my calls. Again he said that he would be sending it out and I gave him the benefit of the doubt, but now it's been over a month since our last conversation and I still have not received my refund and again he is screening my calls."
155,3,"I purchased 2 albums over 2 months ago and still not received them. The site shows that they are currently in stock. I've reached out to customer service on multiple occasions and have been told that they would ship out with the next 2 weeks. That happened 2 months ago, 1 month ago, and recently. Terrible customer service."
156,2,"OK, to begin with, I only write reviews for services that are either really, really good or very, very bad. Unfortunately, this is one of the latter reviews. I ordered a DAC and a set of cables from Sound Stage Direct (SSD); an order totaling nearly $740. Payment was made immediately via my PayPal account. The order was placed on a Sunday and showed online as 'processing'. A week later it was still 'processing' so I called Sound Stage and was greeted by their answering service, who took my contact information and order number, and said that SSD would call me back. After not hearing from SSD for a few days, I called again. Then again. And again. And again. Each time I reached SSD's answering service and I gave them the same information, which they said they would pass on to SSD. In addition, I emailed SSD directly and left messages via their website requesting an update on the order, but no one ever returned my calls or emails. After two weeks of trying to get an update, I sent a message via their website asking them to cancel my order. The very next day I received a call from Seth (the store owner) who apologized extensively, explaining that it was a perfect storm of people being on vacation, out sick and otherwise unavailable to return my calls. I accepted Seth's apology and he quickly shipped the DAC (the most expensive part of the order at $600), which I received a few days later. The DAC was exactly what I had ordered and all was good even if it did take three and a half weeks to get a product described as 'ships in 3-5 days' via UPS ground. But what about the rest of the order: the cables? After receiving the DAC I called SSD again regarding the cables. The call was immediately answered by Jim (suggesting that Seth's explanation regarding staffing challenges was valid; a good sign - or so I thought). Jim located my order and said he would call back later that day with an update regarding the cables. Needless to say, he did not call back that day or anytime during the next three days. I called again and Jim answered. He recalled my order and our conversation, and said that they would not be able to ship the cables until the following week. I said that this was not a problem and asked him to keep me updated, which he agreed to do. Two hours later I received an email from PayPal saying that my account had received a credit/refund from SSD for the cost of the cables. I went online to check the status of my order; it showed as 'cancelled'. No communication or explanation was received from SSD. Based on this experience, I am lead to believe that SSD is a business significantly smaller than it's website would suggest. They clearly have challenges stocking and supplying all of the items that they advertise on their website. This is not necessarily a problem if the customer knows and accepts this. However, when this is combined with disorganization in the way the business is run and a lack of transparency by their staff, then it is a problem. This lack or transparency, integrity and service results in a business who provides, at best, a 'hit and miss' experience. The service I received from SSD was unreliable and showed a fundamental lack of respect. Businesses like this are being driven 'out of business' by the likes of Amazon every day, which is one of the reasons I look to shop at places like SSD. But if they do not focus their attention on the customer experience, their customers will eventually turn to the Jeff Bezos' of the world - and they will have only themselves to blame."
157,1,"Horrible. Ordered several albums that were awaiting repress, anticipated waiting. Found everyone else had the same albums available. After a few months, decided this is silly waiting so i canceled the order. Got confirmation of cancellation. They asked twice about store credit or refund. I requested refund. Never happened. No store credit on account either. I notified them twice by e mail and once by internet chat requesting refund again. I received multiple apologies but never a refund. I have now started the process to stop payment through the credit card i used. Not recommended!"
158,1,"This company does not give it's customers the respect they deserve. i'm waiting close to a month for my order. They don't answer the phone, it gets forward to a answering service. They say you will get a call back. Wishful thinking, no calls back. They will not even answer email inquires. Most companies do not charge your credit card until items are shipped. Soundstage will charge you as soon as you make an order."
159,1,"I pre ordered a $100 album that was due to arrive around May 18, on about May 12 they were now selling the album with ships in 3-5 days. On May 23 I called and they said that they were filling orders in the order that they were received. I received the album on June 3 with the slipcase damaged on both sides. I wrote 3 emails with no response, I have ordered from this company on many occasions with very long wait times and many excuses but NO MORE! Don't spend your money here!!!"
160,1,"I ordered two albums from these clowns on, 01-03-18, today, is 01-25-18 and still no albums. I sent in an email, and got this reply"" higher tan usual volume"". This isn't my first order. Which also was held up because of ""higher than usual volume"". Finally, today I get a email saying, that it has been submitted for pick up by Usps. You'd think that after making me wait a month for my order, they'd at least send it by ups, instead of snail mail. Gee, thanks for nothing. Never again from these guys. Amazon had the same albums, with two day delivery. If I can put 0 stars I will. Do you self a favor, and go elsewhere, Your money will be better spent. Both my transactions with these people were regretted immediately."
161,1,"I ordered a vinyl album for my daughter from this company that was clearly shown as in-stock on the website. Five days later I received an email stating it was not actually in-stock, and was awaiting re-press by the record company with no press date known at the time. I understand that mistakes happen, however, I was charged for the item anyway. I think it is a deceptive business practice to bill for an album that is not available, with no statement as to when a re-press will happen if it even does. I have filed a dispute with PayPal over the matter and it remains to be resolved. If it is not resolved this review will be filed as a complaint. Beware of this company - see my next review for why I do not trust that this company will fulfill this ""potential"" future order."
162,2,"I have ordered countless records from SSD over the last few years and was initially thrilled with the company, as things were shipped promptly/well, selection good, etc ... But over the last year I have had so many lengthy fulfillment delays, only to be undercut by even more ""lazy/no answer/no follow-up"" interactions. I've tried so darn hard to be understanding & patient, but there is no excuse for how the customer is being disregarded these days ... (I'm still waiting on an order that was released in Oct & I paid for back in May!) The vinyl renaissance seems to have spoiled an outlet that initially championed the movement."
163,2,"I placed an order several weeks ago, have not received my order and the tracking information is incorrect. I have tried on several occasions to contact them for assistance and they will not respond. Will never shop there again."
164,2,"I want to like them and I'd love to purchase from them more often as opposed to going to Amazon. Their shipping is soooooooo slow! While I understand that I had my recent purchase shipped ""media mail"" I was under the impression that it would ship out a few days after I placed the order. It has now been 17 days and they're still processing. This is the second time it's happened. I almost feel as if I have to remind them to ship it. It really is a shame, because I would love to support small businesses, they have an excellent selection of vinyl, and the people in customer service seem great. I would have absolutely no complaints if they just shipped out their orders in a timely manner."
165,3,"I have ordered from this company twice now. Almost all orders say that they will be shipped within 2-4 business days, unless otherwise noted. My first order was placed on 1/31. It was still processing after 4 business days. I sent an email to the company that took more than 24 hours to respond to. They didn't explain why there was a delay, and said that they had everything ready and I should get a confirmation of shipment by the end of that day, and that they had expedited the shipping. I did get an email by the end of the day, but it hadn't shipped. It had just had a UPS label scanned and that it was ready for pick up from UPS. The estimated time of arrival is for 2/15. So much for expedited shipping. That is 13 business day total if you count Saturdays. So, it took them at least 6 business days to process the order, 7 business days before it actually was on a UPS truck. So, not expecting the bad experience just mentioned, I placed a second order on 2/4. I just checked the status of that order, and it is still processing. Today is 2/10. I never count the day the order was placed as the first business day, because most businesses don't either. Today marks the 5th business day of processing. This order is quoted as ""usually ships within 2-4 business days"", just like the first order I placed. That's not a good experience. It doesn't say, usually process within 2-4 business days. It says ""ships"". Also, if their idea of expediting shipping doesn't result in shipment received any quicker than media mail, then they shouldn't tell you that they have expedited it. Another concern is that they do charge you immediately when they get your order. Any other company that I have dealt with ""holds"" the funds until the item has shipped. They can claim its for security reasons all they want, but if I have a problem and want to cancel an order, I have to wait for their claim of however many business days it takes to refund me. They do have good discounts, however Amazon is starting to beat their prices and I can get free shipping at Amazon with much better correspondence and ability to trust what they say."
166,1,"I placed two orders with SoundStage Direct,LLC on August 20th 2016 to purchase eleven albums one order was $124.76 and another for $177.95.One album they were not able to get and four albums were supposed to ship in two to four business days and the other album should have been in stock because my printed receipt shows no side note for how long it will take. My question is why are they making a transaction when half the albums I ordered where not able to ship in a few business days. How about giving my money back to my credit card until the other albums are in stock and ready to ship. They have $132.76 on my credit card and I have no product. BAD BUISNESS PRACTICE."
167,3,"I went in to fix my screen on an Iphone 6 plus on 9/16/2017. I had no malfunction on my phone, everything was working fine as my screen cracked 6 days prior to going into the store. The fingerprint feature was working perfectly fine. I paid $60 to get my screen fixed as well as my sister. I left for... a few minutes and came back, paid the money and left with out checking my phone. I then used my finger print feature and it did not work. I went back to the store met an employee at the door who asked that I come back the next day and that he would need to do a hard reset on my phone for the feature to work. I came back the next day and the same employee was not there. Other employees tried to fix the problem by telling me that they would first back up my phone and do the hard reset (WHICH I DID AND LOST PART OF MY BACHELERETTE PARTY PICTURES). The problem was still not resolved after visiting the store 3 times. I then went bank and met the first employee who was out for a few days. He immediately denied responsibility and said that it was a software issue. HE WAS RUDE AND KEPT YELLING. HE HAD A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT THEY WERE WRONG?"

171,1,"We ordered a TV from and they used Ceva Logistics for their delivery service. We ordered the TV on 8/24/2017 and I received an email with a shipping confirmation on 8/25/2017. However, the link with Ceva to track the package was unavailable. As such, I called multiple times per day to inquire about the status of our TV and received zero feedback from CEVA between 8/25/2017 to 9/1/2017. Most recently, I was able to get in contact with one of Ceva's representatives and they were able to let me know that the tracking of the TV had been updated and that they will be able to deliver it on Friday 9/8/2017 between 6:30pm-8:00pm. Today is Friday 9/8/2017 and they just called me at 2pm to inform me that our TV was at our house. I informed them that this not the correct delivery time and asked if they can deliver it at the appropriate time. The delivery person informed me that they cannot do that and that he was unaware of the proper delivery time. I then asked if I can rush home (I work 20 minutes away from my home) so that I can get the TV today. He said that this is not possible and that he cannot wait for me. Then, I called CEVA to inform them of this issue. They are now calling the delivery person to see if he can stay and wait for me. This entire delivery has been a complete disaster. This company lacks professionalism and I do not recommend them for any services."
172,1,Terribly poor service. The item I ordered from Overstock was never delivered without any notice. I was waiting for two days (4 hours each day) for delivery and was on hold about one hour two times when I called them. Don't want to deal with them again. Never ever!!! It is waste of time.
173,1,"This company is the worst of the worst. I have shopped online for as long as it's been available. I have never had such a negative experience as the 2 times this company has been making a deliver for. Do not buy anything that is delivered by this company unless you wish to spend countless hours. Hold time average more the 40 minutes at CEVA. First order was supposed to be signed for. They just left 3 very heavy boxes on my door step. Second order was supposed to be delivered today, but it's not yet out for delivery!! Now I am spending more wasted time waiting for an order that won't be delivered. No call, no email from CEVA. I am reaching out to see if they have a better way to deal with this company. It puts in bad light too. Just not what you would expect."

On 7/13, I received a call from CEVA that it was delayed and would be delivered between 4pm and 8pm on 7/15. I went home early to receive the delivery and it never came. CEVA did not contact me to let me know that it wasn't coming. I contacted CEVA on 7/16 and was told that the earliest that they could deliver now is 7/20. This is terrible customer service and should not use a company that acts in this manner. I warn everyone to stay away from this company."
175,1,"Failed Overnight Delivery, Failed Communication, Failed Re-Delivery Promise Utter Fail.I placed an urgent order through HP in which case they shipped my order OVERNIGHT AIR using Eagle / CEVA. The order was to be delivered 9/3/15 (next day) but it has still NOT been delivered as of 9/8/15. To make matters worse, customer service at this LA location has been rude and their supervisor has flat out lied to me about delivery. In talking with the company on 9/3 requesting information about the whereabouts of my urgent package, I was told that it would arrive that evening and be offloaded for delivery on 9/4. Which already was LATE but I changed my schedule to accept the delivery. When the shipment still did not arrive as of 2:00pm on 9/4, I called the LA location again. The same rep answered and told me it hasn't offloaded yet and gave me an excuse that they are busy and have a large warehouse with lots to offload. I stated that I was not happy about being lied to about delivery and requested to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor apologized and said my order would be delivered on 9/5, which was a Saturday, so I asked ""you will deliver on a Saturday?"" to which the supervisor replied, ""yes, we also deliver on Saturdays."" I came in on Saturday and had my staff awaiting delivery for this package but nothing. Not even a phone call. I was AGAIN flat out lied to. This has been the most atrocious failure of service and completely inexcusable. Not only did EAGLE / CEVA completely miss my urgent delivery they flat out lied to me twice! My experience with this company has been a joke. I have emailed HP already about this and will provide them with additional details about CEVA practices. "
176,1,"Hi, I bought a parrot through this website emailing back and forth with this email address https://www.willparrotsavairy.com. We talked on the phone, His name is Blake supposedly. My parrot is paid in full with delivery, paid like... 600.dollars.... Now I didn’t get my parrot and the guy is not giving me back my money. I started to believe that was a scam because the JFK Pet delivery service was asking for more money. I asked him to send my pet or refund me. Am getting no answer and his website is a fraud and a scam to steal money and not deliver what they promise. This is very disappointing and frustrating. They get away with peoples hard earned money and that is not acceptable. I just want my money back."
177,3,"I've spoken to whom I was told to be the General Manager of Pet's Plus, and I was told I was going to be recieveing a refund for my kitten that I've purchased back in March. He has passed away in September under unknown conditions. Pack was a pet that I've adopted as family for my 5 year old son.... When explained the situation to Dawn she said I was supposed to take him back to the pet store in 10 days. When I purchased him I was told that as a first time pet owner I was not aware of that, and before I was able to take him home he had to be vaccinated several more times. She told me in November that I was going to receive a refund and I haven't yet. I've tried texting, and phone calls all of them are beine ignored. I have even called another one of their locations I've left a message with employee and he said she was the only one who handles these matters. Still no contact and no refund."

I have been getting the run around regarding a refund for purchase, required check up (because the gift insurance provided... through the store also hasn't reimbursed me for the visit) and cremation. I spoke to Manager John who was very empathetic, but advised I would need to speak to Dawn regarding a refund as she is the adoption coordinator. Dawn only returned my call when animal control contacted her. I have placed additional calls and today I haven't received a returned call since then with was in early- May or a refund. I don't wish to obtain another dog from them because there was some information provided which made it seem as someone else's dog may have also passed away about the same time."
179,1,"Contacted Juan through his webpage inquiring about buying a puppy. He said he had 2 female Rottweiler puppies. I asked if I could come up today 3-19-16 to see & buy the puppy he said ok. We (my son and I) drove to the address on the website that even says just drop by. When we got there, their... was no pet store signs for the address. So we knocked on the door and a lady and child answered the door and had no idea of any puppies. We walked back to my vehicle where I tried to call Juan. I got his voicemail, so I left a message. I then proceeded to text him that I was at the address that his store was supposed to be at. I then got no response from him. We waited a few minutes and my son tried to call Juan from his cell phone. He got his voice mail as well. Then he received a text asking if he was calling about the puppies. He said yes. Juan responded STOP. Not only did we drive 2 hours it seems this person only answers for females and does not indeed have a business of selling pets. I felt like it was either a way to get a woman in a bad situation or some kind of scam and am so glad that I had taken my son."

They claim we would have to... still -pay the insurance fee. After doing some research, I have discovered at least three other names for the same company with the same address just in different states. The shipper (cashier) name is Malvin. I've also discovered different names for the seller, but with the same address. Malcom and Keri and Emmanuel and Keri There is a mention of a breeder named Blake.
I would like this company/seller out of business, so no one else is scammed."
181,2,"August 2017, I dropped my dogs, off at Holiday House Pet Resort for a weekend boarding. I asked that both dogs be bathed. Has a trachea issue; upon arrival, I specifically told the handler that he cannot be walked with a ""slip lead"" - which she had brought with her to... transport him. I mentioned this again to the woman behind the counter doing our check-in, and then specifically wrote that he had a trachea issue on his sheet. When my husband went to pick up, he called me in a panic that something was wrong with our dog. He told me that was in distress when they tried to release him, but he had been told that he was merely having a reverse sneezing episode. I immediately asked if he had been on a slip lead when my husband arrived to pick him up. My husband said that he had been, and had been jumping against the restraint in excitement. After a quick, I told him to rush back and ask for help, as there was something clearly wrong and our pet was in severe distress. The veterinarian (who also owns the facility) gave him some medication and said he must have swallowed some water up his nose during his bath. She assured me via phone that he was totally fine. When got to our house, he could barely breathe and was struggling immensely. I rushed him to the emergency veterinary hospital - 45 minutes away. Ultimately, he had to stay in the ICU for 3 days and undergo multiple medical procedures that revealed he had severe inflammation and swelling in his throat. In short, he could not breathe and had suffered an injury of some sort. This had never happened before - ever. I personally went to Holiday House to request the records from his stay. They refused to provide them to me. The manager, Fran, did go out of his way to request the records from the veterinarian who had treated, and then ceased communication with me. Overall, our medical bills were an excess of $1100. Settlement and accountability from Holiday House that acknowledges our dog was greatly injured in their care."
182,3,"We bought a self-washing cat litter box manufactured by the company. The unit is defective, requiring a replacement. It still covered under the manufacturer warranty, by the manufacturer is denying the service. Initially, they asked us to find the purchase receipts in order to honor the warranty...(which is not stated in their warranty disclaimer). Now, when we found the receipt, they warranty was denied because we bought the unit at discounted price - it was sold at Bed, Bath and Beyond new and unopened. Thank you for your attention to this matter."
183,1,"I purchased a product from the company, their cat genie. The unit did not function as expected and dangerous chemicals flowed throughout the device without mixing with the proper water mixture thus creating a toxic environment for my pet, family and home. I contacted the company on numerous... occasions requesting to speak to management only to be denied. I will requested a full refund for the monies paid and was denied. After doing my research on the company it appears this is a normal practice for this company and needs to be investigated. I believe there are serious health risks with their product that need to be investigated and they are not returning money to customers as they should be with dissatisfied customers. If you try to contact the company, they have no live attendance answering the phones only recorded voicemail messages."
184,1,"On Nov 11/17/2015 i went on to the Cat genie Web site in hopes of purchasing two units. With the 15% off Coupon Code i received. Code being the unit is normally priced at $244.00 but if buying more than one they give you an additional 10% off making the unit $219.00. you can still apply any... additional promo codes and discounts to that sales price. I contacted there toll free number hoping to get this cleared up. i was left for 2 hour for a return call when there automated service states 30 mins. Finally, when i do get a rep named Shelly she states that the discount code i had expires to day Nov 17. i said well it's not midnight yet can you do anything to assist me in trying complete the purchase and get the additional 15%off. the agent stated the system is what states what is valid at the time of promotion use. she then hung up and i recalled once again placed on a auto recall system . So i went looking online to other providers or third party vendors and found petco they offered 20% off of the the price that was on sale for 239.99 and that did place me 20 dollars less but not with the same package deal of the provider. i finally get the second call back and was placed on the line with an gentle man by the name of Brian and he was explained the same thing as Shelly with the exception of i informed him of the offer. he stated he wouldn't help me or offer me any type of assistance when it came down to the facts they have an online discount code valid till the end of the day. they would not honor or explain why they would not honor it. Lastly there call back and customer service is rude and shows no respect to a customer that is wiling to spend over $300 dollars for a litter box. this is a scam if not dishonest in advertisement of promotions and discounts towards there products."
185,3,"I purchased the auto-renewal for cat genie supplies. It was great. It eliminated the hassle of not having supplies or needing to order new supplies. Apparently it was a one-year deal and did not auto-renew. I never received notification that the plan was expiring or expired. The only way I knew... was when I went to replace granules, I found I had none. I called to inquire about what had occurred. The rep I spoke with was very polite and helpful. She said I would need to reenroll in their new program (as it had changed and now had an auto renew option). She said that since I had a problem, and I was out of supplies, she would send me one free granule box and one wash cartridge. She said that since I was completely out she would do free 2 day shipping. I was really impressed with the customer service. She said it would ship out the next day and I should have it 2 days later. She was a great customer service rep. Her name was Margie. I received the tracking label from UPS that had a scheduled delivery date of 10/8/15. I never received it by this date. I went back online and checked the status and it said, processed and ready for pickup. 5 days after not receiving it after the delivery date, I called back in and spoke with a Selina, who said she was the senior customer service rep. She said that Margie had misspoken and they would not be sending me granules or cartridge. I felt like she was very rude and would not honor the agreement that was made by Margie. She said I would just need to reregister. This is a problem. When you run out of supplies, the machine stops functioning. When you have no granules the cats go to the bathroom on the floor. I have 3 cats and now a huge mess and problem. This is a good product, but due to this issue, I will not be renewing and will be eliminating the use of the device, unless the issue is resolved."
186,2,"Oh, Where to start... First let me say that I've been a customer of this Petco store since it's opening. I bring my beautiful Golden Doodle to the grooming salon and purchase my food at this store. THE PROBLEMS: The grooming salon has since seen so many changes with some of the worst managers I've ever met. However, Shelly, the new grooming manager, is by far awful. She has NO RESPECT or COMPASSION for me (as a paying customer) nor my dog. When she groomed my dog (she insisted, because my usual groomer wasn't available), she cut his ear!!!! When I asked what happened, she said oh well, he'll be fine. No sorry, no credit, no nothing… She was and continues to be RUDE, and now I have found a NEW salon that cares about my business and my dog. The Store. The store has also seen it's fair share of changes, but I still love going there. The store now, is stocked and clean, and I love it... except for ONE THING.... I was looking for some products that I guess are out of stock or something, I found this girl or guy (I don't know what it is), and asked for help. They said their name was Amanda, new store manager. Well let me tell you how awful she was, the things she was saying to her staff when I was there would never be tolerated in ANY company… She berated her employee's, was narcissistic in her behavior to them... Meanwhile with me, she didn't care to help me, she said ""I don't know, we don't have it"" with a rude attitude and ignored me there after. Next time I returned to the store, I unfortunately ran into her again as she was running down the isle, like its a marathon. I grabbed my food, and hoped to miss her, but she stopped and behaved towards me as if I should leave the store. I WONT BE TREATED LIKE THIS. I""M 55 YEARS OLD AND BELIEVE IN TREATING OTHERS HOW YOU WISH TO BE TREATED. PETCO SHOULD GET BETTER MANAGERS IN PLACE, ONE'S WHO TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND DOGS WITH RESPECT AND GRATITUDE."
187,1,"I purchased a Trixie cat tree online on the 6th of July, 2018. It was delivered on the 11th and reading the dimensions on the box, realized it would be too large for the intended bedroom. Immediately drove the sealed package over to a nearby location and had a smooth return process, because I was prepared with my ID, payment card, and online return receipt. I am still waiting for the refund!! Emailed them at petco@calibamboo.com and their response was to blame Golden1 credit union. Nonsense! I filed a complaint with the BBB, to prevent this from happening to anyone else. PetCo is keeping my money as a short-term loan without interest. Businesses will continue doing this until consumers take the time to report it. Knowledge is Power."
188,3,"I emailed this on Feb. 22, 2018 to customerrelations@petco.com and never received a reply. -- Hi Petco, You've been in my neighborhood a long while, I've occasionally picked up dog food from your store, and I prefer shopping at your location over PetSmart... even though you're a longer drive. Your store is organized and had a clean feel. I usually have a simple and successful time getting what I stop by to grab. But... I've got to tell you. I feel judged and scolded buying fish. And, this isn't something that just happened. Okay, it did happen yesterday. But it's also happened to my husband 1-2 other times while I was with him. Both of his experiences have been within the past year. Awhile back my husband went to bring home a beta fish, then a few weeks later he wanted a snail. My daughter and I stopped in yesterday to get her very own beta. She's 6. But, here's how the interaction goes. I'll start with yesterday... My daughter and I walk up to the employee in the fish department with a fish bowl and food in tow and say we want a goldfish. He asks if we wanted to put it in an open bowl. We said yes. He says he can't sell us a goldfish unless we put it in a tank with a pump. Surprised, I cite how as a college student I had a really cool black goldfish with big eye in an open bowl that lived a long while. He tells me it's actually inhumane. Trying to recover quickly, he suggests a beta fish saying it can be in an open bowl. My daughter being flexible, agrees. Then, we got to check out and I tell the cashier that as someone who works in communication every day there has to be a nicer way to coach and guide customers in their purchases instead of coming across as authoritative. I even suggest having a sign like ""Interested in buying a fish? We'd love to help you make sure you have everything you need to set up your ideal environment."" She said people don't read and says it depends on who I talk to in the store. I swallow my opinion and leave the store. But, here's the deal, Petco. If I owned a store and people had this kind of experience trying to buy things I wanted them to enjoy, I would be heart-broken if I lost a customer because they didn't feel like they could tell me or that I would listen. I do think it's important to treat animals humanely. I do think that people should be screened for having the right environment for their pet. The shelter my family got our rescue dachshund/poodle had a whole application for this and made sure we were aware of the grooming expenses for this breed. But... the conversation was a conversation. An educational conversation. NOT a conversation that made the employee sound like they were in control and I was an idiot for even considering putting a fish in a certain container. I don't keep up with the changes in how a goldfish is sold. It would have been a better experience if when I approached the employee about getting a fish for my daughter... who was standing just beside me... if the employee would ask if I preferred an open bowl fish. Upon saying yes, he could have made it a very magical experience for my daughter and said, ""Well, I'd love to introduce you to some really special fish that would love to live in that bowl."" Then... he could have walked us over and showed off the fish or at least said... ""Here they are... take a look."" So, here I am, begging you to really think about your employee training on communication. Your commercials and marketing are so happy and friendly. But, this customer's experience in your store doesn't line up. Thanks for listening."
189,1,"I was in the Petco in Fairfield, OH the other morning, and I was looking at their small animals. A woman and her son, who looked to be about 3 years old, were looking at the animals, as well. An employee was assisting the woman and proceeded to take a Pac-Man frog out of its enclosure. I was no more than 3 feet away, so while she showed the frog to the other customer, I looked, too. Well, this dimwit employee, who has no business handling animals, was holding the frog on her open palm, making no effort to cup it in her hand or hold it securely. She then poked at it with her other hand, and to the surprise of no one, the frog tried to escape and fell at least 4’ to the bare concrete floor onto its head. Casually leaned down and retrieved the now dazed frog saying, “Ha, he doesn’t care, he just thinks, ‘I’m free!’. I was speechless. She proceeded to hold the frog in the exact same manner and poke at it again, and the dumbass let the frog fall AGAIN!!! By this point, I was furious. I cannot comprehend the carelessness and nonchalance exhibited toward the welfare of an animal by someone in charge of looking after it, or how someone so stupid could be put in that position at all. Before I could bite my tongue, I muttered something along the lines of, “Jesus effing Christ!” I then quickly turned and walked a couple aisles away, as I was on the verge of losing my temper. I continued to watch as this twit went on showing animals to the woman and her kid. She took out a lizard next. I looked away for a moment and next thing I see is the employee on the floor reaching under the aquariums to retrieve the lizard and saying, “He can’t go anywhere.” I don’t know if this animal also fell to the floor, but it would appear that it did. Either way, it had escaped her, as well, and was in danger of being lost in the store. I’m reporting this incident to their corporate office, but I have little faith that anything will be done. I learned from another employee that while Petco likes to preach about adopting animals as opposed to purchasing them from breeders, their own animals are purchased from breeders. The best part is that the animals are shipped like mail through the likes. One really must wonder if getting dropped on their heads is the worst thing to happen to these animals. Petco should be ashamed of letting such a careless and irresponsible person tend their animals, and for having hired her in the first place. Did not show the least bit of concern that the animals may have been hurt because of her and that seems to be right on par with the mentality of this corporation."
190,1,I would like to give this business a 1 star. Petco in Brentwood Ca was very unprofessional when i took my dogs in for grooming on 2/8/18. The head groomer called very rudely to state that one of the dogs had bit her 3 times; she also mentioned that the dog had bit before. the question is if the dog has bitten before where was the notification was the first time; why did you except the appointment in the first place. 2nd compliant i took 2 dogs in the second dog remained in the cage for 2 hours without being touched; the supervisor Cory stated they assumed we were going to leave the dog. Yes leave the dog for grooming. Petco made the decision that this dog was also a violent dog but rather have us take both dogs at the same time; they told us about one and had us leave the other. The dogs are a chihuahua and a Yorkie and neither dogs has ever had a problem at any other groomer and we have had them since they were puppies. They way this situation was handled was very unprofessional and i felt the dogs were more at risk than anything else. With new discussion going on about dog groomers and how they treat your pets; be weary if you decide to take your dog to Petco 5481 Lone Tree Way Brentwood Ca.
191,1,"2752 Veterans Rd West Staten Island, NY 10309 (718) 227-9723 GROOMNG IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! I brought my puppy here for his first groom because they only charge $25.00. Well you know the saying...you get what you pay for. The groomer that did my pup was Diana, the grooming manager! Okay, she said that after she bathed my pup, he pooped and then rolled in it and had to rebate him. I suspect it happened in the drying crate. She probably left him there without any reassurance, and he probably got scared Shit, pardon the pun. When she told me she did not seem to be annoyed, but when she handed my pup over to me and I examined my pup, I knew she was! 1) She didn't shave his face and paws as I had requested. I told her and she said oh right, I forgot. I observed her from the window as she took the buzzer and began to work on his face, of course this being his first time, he was hesitant and resistant, Diana looked very annoyed and went back to get someone to hold him, she never introduced him to the sound and feeling of the buzzer prior to buzzing him, and she didn't do a good job of it, his muzzle was all uneven and I had to ask her to get under his chin as well. Still did a horrible job, my pup now has uneven hair on his muzzle, and it looked better before she touched it. She made it look worse. 2) She didn't even bother to clean his ears! I was shocked when I looked at them, heck if I was able to do it I wouldn't have brought him there. The chunks of hair inside his ears were not touched, and there was ear gook all over. She was on the phone and told the person she was talking to that she was almost done with this customer, to which I stated...no your not.... you didn't clean his ears...she replied once again, oh sorry I forgot. She stated she would take him in the back (the room with the mirrored door that you can't see into) for some unknown reason. A short time later she returned and told me to watch one ear because there was a lot of stuff in it and it had a slight order which could mean sign of infection, so much for the ""7-Point Pet Care Check"" which was not done automatically. Besides I have never been to a groomer that did not groom the ears! 3) When I got home, I noticed that she did not even clean his paw pads nor clip his nails! This was supposed to be part of the service, not to mention I asked her to shave his paws on top and she didn't do that either. 4) She did not clean his wee wee! Another thing I have never seen a groomer not do! I complained to the store and they offered me 15% off. Heck they should not have even charged me the extra $15.00 for the services that were not done at all or the ones that were not done properly. Needless to say, I did not tip her, nor will I be going back anytime soon! My advice.. stay away."
192,2,"On August 4, 2016, my healthy, one year old, neutered male dog was groomed at Doggie Style Pets at, Philadelphia, PA. My dog had been groomed several times at other businesses with no issue. I paid at 3:05 PM, and immediately after picking him up, at 3:09 PM, he urinated dark...red, nearly black, urine. I immediately took him to, the nearest emergency veterinary hospital. While end route to the ER, I contacted Doggie Style and spoke with the store's manager who informed me my 100 lb dog jumped from the bathtub while being groomed, but it didn't appear severe at the time. I was not informed of this at checkout, which is where I believe the dishonest business practices begin. I was told that the business uses their own, in-house veterinary service, but that it was not an emergency veterinarian. I stated my distress at the severity of the situation, and that I believed immediate emergency veterinary care was required. I was assured by the manager that if the veterinarian determines trauma to be the cause, they would handle veterinary expenses. On September 2, 2016, I mailed Doggie Style Pets pictures of my dog with the bloody urine timestamped 4 minutes after the time on my receipt from the store. I included a copy of my receipt, my dog's medical chart demonstrating bloody found in his bladder, with trauma as the diagnosis, and requested a full refund for the grooming service rendered at the store and reimbursement for the veterinary medical expenses that were previously promised. Over one month later, on October 17, 2016, the business owner, Howard, denied the previous claim that my dog jumped from the bath tub. I was also denied the full reimbursement that previously promised by the business and offered $220 in store credit. My dog received physical harm at this location and they could not pay me to bring him back, therefore the credit is absolutely useless to me. The business reneged on its promise to cover medical costs, which I believe to be dishonest."
193,3,"Brought my cat for the 2nd time to this grooming place. I requested the lion cut grooming package which costs $75 which includes: nail trim, ears cleaned, wet or dry bath and a haircut. I also requested her teeth be brushed since I had a coupon. The staff called me 5 hours later that my cat is ready... to be picked up. Upon arrival I asked how she did because last time I brought her there she was calm and given a bath. No problems at all. The staff said she was trying to bite and scratch the groomers. I asked if she had her teeth brushed and they completely forgot. I asked if she got a bath. They said she didn't need one because she's clean. First of all, she hasn't had a bath in 8 months. only thing they did was give my cat this horrible cut that she looks like she's been skinned, and I do not recognize her. She looks like she has cancer or leprosy. I asked if they trimmed her back claws, cleaned her ears, gave her at least a dry bath and they said no because she was difficult to handle but they were able to do the most difficult thing which was cut and shave her WHOLE body. They charged me $81 for the whole package that originally costs $75 and they did not do any other service but did a terrible job on the haircut. If she was aggressive, their staff should've called me ASAP and I would've picked her up since I only live 5 mins away. She did not receive the most important service, which was a bath. Spoke with owner and she said she has to pay those two groomers. She then told me that I don't have hair from head to toe, I don't bite or scratch, so that's why they charge me the full price and an additional $6 which came out to a total of $81. This cost more than a woman's wash, cut and blow dry. my cat wasn't even washed. They could manage to shave her whole body but not be able to wrap her in a towel and trim her claws or clean her ears with a q-tip?? Doesn't make any sense. No one from there staff notified me until I had to ask when I picked her up 5 hours later."
194,3,"Had appt for dog grooming at 10:00 am, July 29th. Dropped off my 6-pound yorkie at 10:10 that morning. At approximately 1:45, my husband received a call my puppy was finished. My husband arrived approximately 5 minutes later. Upon arrival, head groomer Laura said that my puppy was finishing up...behind the glass. My husband took one look and twice said that's not my dog. Laura says if course it is, he is the only Yorkie we have on the premises. My husband pays for the service, with tip and leaves the facility with this dog. Upon getting him home, I immediately knew it was not my dog. My son, at this point, calls the Shop and insists that this is not our dog and where is our dog? At this point they have I'm assuming discovered that they did, in fact, have another Yorkie. I thought my puppy was stolen. In the mean time, I spent a half hour chasing this strange dog around my yard, because he's petrified of us and my other dog. Starts pooping all over my rug and floor. Diarrhea, I might add. Neglect at its finest. Not sure whether I'm more upset that they sent the wrong dog home with the wrong people or the fact that they had no idea that my dog was back in a cage for 4 hours."
195,1,"I took my dog to this business to get groomed and she came back with fleas. We called the company right away and the owner said that she tries to quarantine the dogs that have fleas, but they cannot always prevent all of it. My dogs fleas increased I called them for a refund and the owner agreed,... but when my husband went to pick up the money she yelled at him and reneged on what she said. I called her because I was just leaving work and she yelled and talked over me. Now my other dog has fleas, we have to get both of them treated with is going to be $165 for both for the initial treatment and we have to use a exterminator to bomb our home to kill the fleas that will cause an infestation in our home which alone will cause a safety risk to my family. Poor and unsanitary business; they do not even require that the dogs have health/shot records."

Owner has several expensive pets for sale on website, everything looks legit, we talked texted and email agreed on price and he said he would airmail my dog to me the next day after I him $635.00 next day he got his money everything was going good I thought! I get a call from... another phone number in Maryland it was the same guy changing his voice saying he was from the US Postal service and I had to pay another $285.00 for insurance, i refused he hung up and he blocked my number so I could not call or text him anymore! Needless to say i haven't heard anything back from him and have not received any dog! The dog i supposedly bought and paid for is still on his website for sale! Please try to shut this guy done before he screws anyone else out of their money! I'm not upset about the money I'm upset that my dog had died 2 days earlier and I was trying to replace her for my kids then I had to break their hearts all over again by telling them there would be no puppy delivered to them and the whole thing was a scam, they have cried their eyes out for days now over the loss of their dog and we're crushed to find out the money we had for a new puppy was taken by a scam artist! Please shut him down before he breaks anyone else's heart!!!"
197,2,"I was a customer of Red Opal for pet walking services for my two dogs. I required services at my home Monday- Friday for one hour to walk my dogs (two 30 minute walks). I noticed in March of 2017 that my credit card was being billed for additional dog walks - in one week increments amounting to...$436.12. I contacted the business and requested an explanation and refund for the additional services I was billed. I spoke with the business employees (maybe owners) Lana and Jen and they indicated the additional bills were an error and that my credit card would be refunded. My credit card was never credited and upon numerous emails and phone calls to correct this error and adjust my account, the error was never corrected. I ceased using Red Opal on 6/15/2017 because I was not receiving an adequate response. I'm hoping for a resolution of being credited for the dog walks that were never provided. To date, I believe that Red Opal owes me approximately 5 weeks of dogs walks amounting to $2,180.06."
198,3,"We were quoted incorrect prices twice on rabies vaccine. Twice we were quoted $25, but we were billed $38. Dr. was incredibly rude and rough to my pets. We paid for an exam for both animals and, in my opinion, an adequate exam was not done on either of them. They were both examined in the... back. Only one was brought back by the doctor and she proceeded to use her bare index finger to push on a tooth that was swollen around the base, making puss come out of his mouth, and making him yowl in pain. Our second pet was brought back by an assistant with no mention of her health or any concerns. We were whisked to reception and given our total. That does not qualify for an exam! When I contacted the hospital manager, Heidi to address my problems and ask her to make it right, she told me there is nothing she can do. She never listened to my issues and never offered anything to make things right."
199,2,"We adopted a dog in March of 2015. Was very nice & very informative about the dog. We signed the papers & we're so thrilled to adopt a dog who fit really well into our family. Soon after adopting the dog, my fiancé got sick. 3 weeks after having the dog we realized he was in fact allergic to the dog. Very strange because we've lived with dogs in the past & do now currently, so we couldn't exactly pin point what my finance was allergic to with that breed- all in all, the dog did not work out unfortunately. Anyways, keeping our side of the agreement, we did as we signed in the adoption papers & not find him a new home ourselves, but gave him back to find a new home. Became very cold to us soon after. We were told we would get the $200 out of the $400 we paid initially for the adoption when the billing quarter ended in June. Here we are 7 months later still with no money back & always getting an excuse for not getting paid still. I support the cause of adopting a dog but would bring my business elsewhere to a shelter who is organized & keeps their word."
200,3,"We filled out paperwork and provided a check for $250 for the adoption/rehoming of a 6-year-old golden lab. We did not receive the same day, because her current owner was out of state, and wanted a chance to say goodbye. Within 24 hours (on May 31st, 2016) we contacted Angela and... requested that our check not be cashed. We had just found out that my husband and I were infertile, and felt we should wait before adopting an animal. Angela agreed not to cash the check, and we never received. Three days later, the check was cashed. It has now been well over a month and Angela will not return our money. Yes, we filled out the paperwork, but we did not receive what we paid for. Angela has been uncooperative and unwilling to come up with a plan to return the $250."
201,1,"First if you're going into Food Lion in Columbia Maryland be ready for the creepy employees to have a nerd off with you in the check out line. They are as you guessed rude. But get this. A creepy white female about 25-35 came in there straight from the nuthouse, off her medications again. The woman in question was acting suspicious. She was the typical liberal white black heart attack. So many American moms should have their license to be moms revoked. When I came into the store I was applying for a job. She became belligerent and committed disorderly conduct. If you want to save your life, do not trust those people Frankie. Food Lions employees and customers are insane. See mob scene from Frankenstein. I would shop at Giant on Centre Park Drive. The food is better. The selection is better. Some of the customer service employees are nice at Giant. Especially one of courtesy clerks. They treat the customers like people at the Center Park Giant. Way more professional than Food Lions employees. Avoid Food Lion."
202,2,"I have been a customer of Food Lion for decades. Until I moved to Durham, NC, I did not have any complaints in all of those years. Because of the treatment and conduct of a cashier at Food Lion Store #1343, I felt it was necessary to write a complaint and give it to the Store Manager. Because of the convenient location, I continued to shop at this Food Lion store avoiding the checkout line where this cashier was working. I did not know that my written complaint was known by other Food Lion employees in this store. This became very clear recently when I was at the checkout line and a cashier treated me in a very disrespectful way. She seemed to especially have a problem with the bottle of wine I was purchasing because after placing all my groceries in a bag, she left the wine unbagged. I asked her to please put the wine in a bag. She told me in a very harsh voice to pay first. I did not know what to think. Was she questioning my ability to pay or did she have a problem with people purchasing alcohol? I paid as she told me. She then placed the wine in a bag while telling me in a sarcastic tone to ""have a blessed day."" I was dumbfounded as to why this cashier acted the way she did. On another day, I went back to this Food Lion store. I told a Food Lion customer service representative about what had occurred. I showed her my receipt which had the cashier's name on it. I was told that this cashier was there and I could just talk to her. I went over to this cashier and asked her why she treated me the way she did. This Food Lion employee started yelling and saying she was busy and did not have time to talk to me. I told her that I could have gone straight to the Store Manager instead of coming to her. This cashier told me to go ahead and go to the Manager. I then turned and went back to the Customer Service Desk. Before I could say anything, this cashier ran up to the service desk and said that I am the one who made a complaint against a Food Lion employee. I then knew why I had been treated with such animosity. It was because this cashier was retaliating against me because of the written complaint I had made. The Store Manager gave me a $15 Food Lion Gift Card as an apology for what happened. I will be using this Gift Card at another Food Lion store."
203,3,"On Jan. 8, 2014, I picked up 2 packages of lunch meat (Oscar Meyer Deli Fresh) (ironic) at Food Lion #809 (3037 Legion Rd. Fayetteville, NC) around 8:30am that was on sale. When my teen son got home from school, he made himself a sandwich. Two hours later, he came to me complaining that his stomach and head hurts. I gave him a Tylenol and had him take a shower. Before I knew it, he started vomiting profusely and had diarrhea. The only thing he had ate in the two hours he was home was the sandwich, so I checked the date on the lunch meat and sure enough it was expired (Jan. 2, 2014). I will be confronting the Manager this morning. That is their job to check dates not mine. But you can be assured I will be obsessed with it now. The other package of lunch meat doesn't expire till Feb. 4, 2014."
204,1,"On October 08, 2013, I went to purchase a 12-pack of beer. My wife is a regular there so I thought me going there will be a good idea since it's close to my house. I happened to take my son with me. He is 4 years of age and I was denied to purchase the beer from the cashier. I demanded to speak to The Manager. He goes by the name of Scott. He informed me that I couldn't buy it since my son was present and it was up to him to sell it to me or not. I was very respectful and polite to him and I asked him for the corporate phone number which he replied that they were closed and that if I wanted to call corporate, I should google the number. After feeling very disrespected by Mr. Scott, I decided to call the police so that they can write a report and present it to an attorney to find out if my rights were violated.
When the police arrived, I was able to purchase the beer. My Wife also came to the store demanding answers from the manager but he refused to speak with my wife. I will not recommend this place to anybody. This manager thinks he can take the law into his own hands. Please stay away from this place. The customer service is the worst I had ever experienced. My name is David, a very disappointed customer. If you feel you were disrespected by this manager Scott, please contact me at so that we can take legal action and this kind of behavior will never happen to anyone else."
205,3,"The reason I have a concern, my daughter Krista has been with Food Lion 7 years. She is a very good worker, shows up to work every day. She found out Friday she was going to have a baby. Went to her boss and told him. He took it upon his self to go tell other managers in the store. She was called stupid...and has been put down since then. I called in to the store and voiced my concern. Her boss, Nancy, was saying all kinda stuff, ""she should be married"", etc. I told her mind her own business. She told me ""now the drama will start."" The bosses are very rude to the people that work there...my daughter did not want the store to know about this until she went to the doc, but boy, news traveled real fast. Shame on them. Then today, she goes and someone tells her that ""they are going to hire someone else because you probably will not show up."" Her dog was sick, we took it to the vets, and this is what she hears today. I would like to know your privacy act. I do believe your bosses at the Hanover location broke it. I will no longer shop there or support a store that cannot treat their workers better than this. I know they are messing with my daughter and grand baby. My son worked there two years. He could not wait to found another job. They are so rude. There is plenty of people will back this up. You may call me. I would love to talk to management. She is so upset how she is being treated. Just because she's having a baby does not mean she is going to change to another person. She is a very hard worker. Please call me any time. I would love to talk to someone about what all has been said to her. She will be calling too. Thanks."
206,2,"I bought almost $140 worth of groceries yesterday and when I got home and put them away, I was missing 2 frozen dinners and 4 frozen protein drinks. Also, I should have been given $10 back - I didn't have that either. I went to Customer Service and told them what I was missing. The clerk went to the office and left me standing for about 15 minutes before he returned with $10. A lady came out with him and said the video showed I loaded the groceries in my cart. I asked her if the video showed those items in any of the bags. She repeated that I loaded them in my cart; I still do not have the items I purchased. And if they erred in giving me my $10 change couldn't they have erred in bagging my frozen items? I told them I wouldn't be back. They said okay. This is poor customer service and explains why the store is never crowded."
207,1,"I went to this particular store today because of its convenient location between my gym and home to buy lunch meat and necessities before entertaining out of town guests. Two store employees were blocking the deli counter interacting and laughing as I tried to find a way to get around them and make it a quick trip. When I saw a sale placard for a ham brand on sale, I asked one of three ladies behind the deli case to supply me with a pound of the sale ham. The reply that I got was that they couldn't see the placard and would have to walk out from behind the case to see it even though she had me read it to her, in full, on two occasions. I was yelled at and reprimanded as she walked out and I simply had to stifle any remarks as this woman seemed to be looking for a public fight. I'd rather not be arrested for fighting back with a store employee even if defending myself. I left the counter to go after other items as this lady cut the ham, in order not to instigate any other altercations. I thought perhaps she had been joking with me or would apologize for her behavior but there was no such event, even upon picking up the sliced meat. I will never patronize this store again unless under dire circumstances. It was not just this particular young African American employee but others in the store were unwilling to move out of the way for me to see the deli case. I'm sure there is a store camera that had recorded this event. This is just the first of many reviews I intend to post on this store."
208,3,I am unhappy that your stores are no longer selling Florida Natural OJ as it is an all-American product and I feel it is the best quality for my family. I will now have to drive an extra few miles to do my shopping at the local Kroger or Food City stores near me. I have really enjoyed my experiences at Food Lion but have noticed over the last few months that you are carrying less and less of the brands I favor. The staff at the store here in Johnson City is very nice and I will miss not shopping there anymore but if corporate doesn't care about the customer (only their pocket books) I will have to look elsewhere.
209,1,"Based on long-time experience, I feel the processing and distribution of Food Lion milk comes far short of any regulation or guidelines. This milk, especially since it became part of the WIC food assistance program a couple of years ago, is not going to be fresh for more than one day after opening. And of course, storing in a cold refrigerator. Even if the date is a week away, the milk is rancid in about 2 days. As if it has never been pasteurized or even held in a cold warehouse? Do not buy it unless you are going to use it immediately within 24 hours tops. On the subject of meats, consistently the absolute worst prices you can possibly find. Outrageous."
210,3,"One evening after work, I went to my neighborhood Food Lion to shop. A large gentleman, he appeared to be a store manager, was asking me why do I come so often to Food Lion and I looked like I am hustling. I was very surprised and outright shocked, that was none of his business. I gave him a few reason such as it is closer to home and that I bargain shop. But he had no right to approach me the way he did. Since then, I rarely buy my groceries there, since people over there lack customer service skills and could be doing their jobs instead of being nosy."
211,3,"While at Food Lion store #2122, I wanted to get some fresh baked rolls for lunches, but they were frozen. Even the Artisan bread was frozen. There were two lanes open, one being express so I had to use the other lane with no problem. After I placed my groceries on the belt, I looked up and noticed four employees chatting and joking around. One young girl was adjusting the collar of a male employee. Then one man comes behind me with about three items. The checker of the express was involved with the other three chatting. I left to place my groceries in my car and went to place the cart in the cart holder and the carts were half out in the parking lot. Walking back to my car, I noticed three men getting in their white SUV thinking that they were district managers that I had seen checking out the departments in the store and I said laughing that someone needs to get the carts in. One man speaks up rudely and says, ""I'll get on it."".
There are too many people needing jobs and these people are getting paid for standing around doing nothing. Heck, I can drop frozen rolls in a plastic bag and put them out on the racks. I said to my checker, ""Do they always stand around doing nothing?"" And he said, ""It happens every day and they get paid more than me."" AI almost forgot that when three of them noticed that my checker was now bagging my groceries, they busted their butts racing over to help him after he was almost finished bagging."
212,2,"I have shopped at Food Lion ever since I have lived in North Carolina which is now up to four years and the location on Arlington and Firetower rd. is the closest to me. Each time I go food shopping there is always at least one pack of meat that has gone bad or they expired. Pork chops, a whole turkey for Thanksgiving or steak etc., the food is never updated and continues to be sold even past expiration dates. I spoke with the supervisor there about it once and he said to notify them if we noticed it again and that he will notify his head supervisor also. The discount offers on food are not very much of a discount and the stores have benefited from the price raises throughout two inconvenient occurrences, one in which there was a tornado in a location where they get their food from and another time when we had a hurricane hit the coast. Both were in 2011 within an eight-month span. Since then prices have doubled.
I continued to shop there and still noticed the meat is still expired and I even had to throw away some meat in which I could not get a return on them because I could not find the receipts at the time. Also prices continue to go up while the quality is steadily dropping. As a result, I have to travel over two miles away to Wal-Mart to get meat that was naturally cheaper at Food Lion but now for a more expensive price."
213,2,"I have been receiving Personal Trainer food for about 2 months now. The package when delivered has had melted ice, frozen food cracked and packages of food open. I let this go by for my first 3 deliveries because I really do enjoy the program, it's easy and food is good. However, today I received my 4th package, all of the ice was melted and the food totally defrosted. When I called to complain I was told ""Well I can ship you a replacement order which will get there next Wednesday. We don't do overnight, nor can we guarantee delivery"" (today is Friday) - I now have a trash can full of wasted food and no food in my freezer to eat until next Wednesday.
I had also ordered chocolate shakes with all of my orders and only received them once - I called the first time and they were shipped, they came in the second order, and no shakes in 3rd or 4th order, even after calling to ensure they were still to be included. Since I had auto delivery set up as my program I now chose to cancel and will look elsewhere for a home delivery program. I can only see this getting worse as the summer is now in full swing and their packaging methods leave much to be desired, along with customer service when logging a complaint."
214,2,"Gerber graduates chicken mashed potatoes and carrots - This was supposed to be chicken mashed potatoes and carrots. I heated it for 25 seconds, and this is what it looked like when I pulled the cover off... I almost vomited! I will never buy another Gerber product. This isn't the first time I've bought bad food and I'm sick of it! I'm not sure how it's even possible for carrots to form that shape."
215,1,"When rinsing the plastic rectangular baby food container for recycling, my thumb was sliced pretty good. Took 2 days to heal up. This is due to a very stiff paper/foil material in addition to the outer plastic container. The injury was not that difficult to accomplish. I called the consumer hotline, at their request, after posting a photo of the injury to their Facebook page. They sounded alarmed and said this had never happened before. I find this very hard to believe. I am writing this review to inform others and ask they report any incidents here or online elsewhere. I could not find anything about my experience. In any event, take it as a warning. Do not become a cautionary tale. Handle with care."
216,1,"My now 2-year-old son has been eating Gerber blueberry with whole grains for at least a year and a half. Today we opened a brand new, store bought, sealed package with mold, and one of the sealed cups was empty. This has never happened before, but one time is enough. He did not consume any of this yogurt, but presumably he has eaten yogurt from this plant on previous occasions. Gerber is supposedly a trusted name for all things baby/toddler. This is definitely an eye opener that they cannot be trusted."
217,3,"My 18-month-old was struggling to get the food out of his Gerber Graduates Grabber tonight and when I looked at it, I saw a hard jellied substance sticking out the top. I cut into the package and found that it was through the entire spout and down into the pouch. I can't tell what it is, but it definitely is not supposed to be there! The package is within its sell by date and was kept at normal room temperature after purchase. If my son had been able to suck it through it would have been a major choking hazard and also could have made him sick!"
218,1,"I put a few puffs out for my son to eat while we were eating supper. BRAND NEW PACKAGE! I had just took off the seal. My son started choking. He had never choked like this before and never had problems eating anything. He choked so long he turned blue and we had to call 911. Luckily I had been trained in car or my son would not be here today. I had to flip him upside down to beat him, didn't work, tried several things before I just completely stuck my finger back in his throat as far as I could to get the thing out. They tell you never to do that because it can go back further. Well if I hadn't he would have DIED! It took the ambulance 12 minutes to get here. It takes 6 minutes for brain damage. After everything calmed down, we inspected the Puffs and they were STALE! The BRAND NEW, NEVER OPENED PUFFS WRE STALE! When they got wet it caused them to get STICKY AND HARD NOT DISSOLVE. This product just needs to be taken off the shelf. I don't think any product of sales is worth a child's life. What if I had not known what to do? My child's life would have been on Gerber’s hands."
219,2,"I found this in my 2 year old's meal last week. It looks like a piece of wood. Met with a Gerber rep to pick up this product, haven't heard back from them. I was a very loyal customer. I spent $75-100 each month. My son loved these meals & the other Gerber products but I returned everything that I had because I don't trust Gerber products anymore and now it's hard for me to get him to eat anything because he was so use to eating these meals daily. And I will never buy Gerber products again since this happened and reading all these other reviews!!"
220,3,Hello everyone... This morning for breakfast I gave my daughter banana flavored Gerber baby food. I was halfway through feeding her and was about to give her a spoonful then noticed something strange in her spoon. I looked through it and pulled out a big fingertip size piece of plastic! I've called Gerber repeatedly. All the representatives say they will send me an email in the next hour and they don't! They are not doing anything about this. They are also saying they'll send someone over to my address today and yet there has been nobody that stopped by. My baby is now in horrible pain and I'm bringing her to Er. I believe she ate plastic I did not notice.
221,2,"My mother purchased the stage two Jarred meals of Gerber baby food at a local Target. When I began to prepare my daughter's meal I noticed that when I opened the jar the usual pop didn't happen proving the product wasn't sealed. I looked inside of the jar and there was a huge spongy chunk of mold on top and you could see that the rest of the jar was dried out and moldy. Upon further review I saw that all of the 7 jars my mother picked up all had the tops popped up and all had the mold all with an expiration date of later this year. I never thought that I would have to check my daughter's food before I purchased it and neither did my mother because of all things I at least expect my child to be safe but now I will always have to check two, three, and four times and always inspect. I am absolutely disgusted to think that I have said my daughter this food and she will never be eating Gerber again! Any company that can't take food that goes inside of a baby's stomach seriously is not someone I ever want to do business with!"
222,3,"I have shopped in this store in El Monte, since before it was ""Food 4 Less"". I am a senior citizen and don't buy a lot now, but have raised a family and been a regular customer for over 50 years. When they don't have an advertised item, they don't want to give a rain-check IF: they expect it in a few days or if it's the day of or the day after the ad starts, or whatever the excuse is. That STINKS! Once when they refused, I was at the drugstore in the same shopping center the next day. They STILL didn't have the item & STILL didn't want to give a rain check. Today they don't have the chicken that was advertised. The man in the meat dept. didn't even know it was in the ad. The price starts Wed. This was Thurs. And they expect it on Friday??? Why do they think it is OK for me to make a 2nd trip for one item because they screwed up? I asked the cashier and she used the phone to ask. Then she said she can give me a rain check for up to 5lbs. The man at the next check stand was ""management"". He told her NO, she can't. They will have it tomorrow. I told him that stinks and that is really lousy customer service!!! I was polite but mad! And it will keep happening because in spite of ""The Friendly Place to Shop"" they don't CARE!!!"
223,3,"If you are anything like me and you use coupons you will understand my frustration all too well. Every time I download digital coupons and go to the Food 4 Less on 103rd street in Los Angeles, CA the system does not recognize or add my coupons so in turn I end up with items being rung up for full price that I intended on getting at a cheaper price because I have COUPONS! It's so frustrating! If they aren't going to honor the coupons then it would be best just not to offer them!!! Meat and poultry sit on the cookie isles because there isn't enough help for go-backs. This store although it's in an urban area gives Kroger a bad name. The store is needed but just because the area is poverty stricken doesn't mean those of us of have to shop in this area should be subjected to poor quality of service. IT'S WRONG!"
224,3,"Problem: All the Food for Less in the area seem to be out of my preferred sugarless coconut almond milk. Then, I find it, only to find it priced higher than the store down the street from my grandmother's house. I asked for the manager to inquire about and exchange of the milk I have from the store on my street. Rather than calling a manager as I requested, a checker tells me she is acting manager and that she will not exchange my milks purchased at another food for less for a different flavor because she can tell from the computer scan that the milk is a different price. There was an angry customer with many groceries in line behind me who asked her to check her out so she could leave. I once again asked her to speak to a store manager. The checker tells me that she is the acting manager. I asked her to give me the number to her corporate office and she tells me that she will call the manager. This is over a price difference in milk from a Food for Less one more exit over, less than a mile and 1/2 away. I know that for exchanges of items the price make no difference for an exchange, at least it hasn't the last couple of years I have shopped and worked for grocery and my mother has worked for grocery and my husband and every other time I have exchanged bad or wrong items. However, today this employee decides to act as if I am taking something from her personal pocket and she wants to play manager, until I ask for the corporate number. Meanwhile, my handicapped aunt is still sitting in the car waiting for me to get out and take her home with the sugar free milk. Scenario: Checker, whose name I neglected to get. She was about 5'6 with tattoos on her right forearm, black hair, medium length, she wore it pulled back in a mid length bun. I believe she is of Hispanic descent. I stood in the back of the line with three Califia milks and asked if she could call the store manager. She asked me what the problem was. She asked if I needed a price check. I told her I would like to speak with the acting manager. She told me to stay in line and she would help me. Background: Food for less on Imperial and Long Beach are out of stock on Califia toasted almond coconut milk 6/10/15. The milk was priced at $2.99. This is a dollar cheaper than the price I saw in Maywood at the Food For Less on Slauson and Pine Ave 6/09/15 $3.99 the morning before, and they were also out of stock. This time I asked an employee at the Imperial location to check in the back for me. After checking he found there was no more milk available, I asked for a rain check. He spoke to the lady who was ""acting manager"" or ""team..."" is what she calls herself. I have seen her there numerous times, tall, she wears a short, high bun in her hair, and wears it pulled back. The male employee who helped me told me that the manager said that rain checks are only given for things that are in the sell paper. I did not bother to check the sell paper to see if the milk was there because I have never personally seen Califia milk advertised in a sell paper. What is the deal with the customer service around these parts. When do the food for less in the area get the new stock in? Why are the prices different from Los Angeles to Lynwood. They are both poor areas."
225,3,"As I was leaving Food 4 Less my cart locks on me right on the exit door hitting me hard on the front of my right leg. Right away I get the help of one of the cart guys and security guy as they are trying to unlock the cart and could unlock it they start dragging it out. Meanwhile I'm in pain lifting up my pant, I show them it's bruising and getting swollen. I ask the cart guy ""can I get a manager?"" He runs to help get him out. The manager comes out already piss off asking, ""Why it happen? Did you go through our registers because this normally doesn't happen,"" he try accusing me of a thief now. I ask ""can I get an ice pack?"" He said ""we don't provide any. I can get you some from the meat department. I ask ""let me file an incident report,"" he say ""we don't offer incident reports unless you ask for one.""
Then he runs back inside the store, brings me an icepack and says ""here you go and if something really happened here we have cameras on out entrance and exit door,"" well guess what good you tell me that this manager was a total punk. When he brought the icepack he thought I was just going to leave, so I said ""thanks for the ice supposedly you didn't have but I still want to file the incident report."" He's all mad say ""follow me."" I tried following as fast as I can but now I'm limping and lost him for a minute. Ok he comes back out, throws me the paper, and still has the nerve to say I don't have any witness. I said the security guard, he says ""no he doesn't count, he does not work for us."" The cart guy finally, he just gave me the cart guy's name, went home, called corporate office's managers at Food 4 Less, seriously need training on how to give good customer service."
226,2,"I opened a credit card account with Roaman's online after being promised $20.00 off. They take only $10.00 off your first purchase with the promise of an additional $10.00 off your next order placed on their credit card. I placed the order and received the first $10.00 off automatically. I tried to place a second order but I hadn't received my new credit card yet. They were having troubles with their online server at the time, and didn't have access to my new account information. The clothes were only on sale for a few more hours so my son paid for them with his PayPal. It wasn't their fault. I paid my first billing from Roaman's in full for my original order. I neglected to see a Rewards Coupon to be used when I placed my next order. I placed my second order using my Roaman's credit card without the Rewards Coupon Promo Code, my error. When I received the statement I realized they don't automatically take the second $10.00 off the bill like the first order. I called Roaman's and explained my situation. I waited 30 minutes and had to talk to a rep, a fit specialist and finally customer service. Customer Service told me they could not give me $10.00 off unless I ordered another order on my credit card because that's the way it is done.
I said that is fine, but I'm not interested in purchasing anything right now after already purchasing $200.00 worth of clothing. I only got this Credit Card for the discounts so if they can't honor a $10.00 Rewards well knowing the purchases were made then why would I keep their Credit Card? No savings here. This isn't about who's right or who did or didn't do whatever, it's about Customer Service. If you don't want to service your customers don't expect to keep them. I will be closing my account with this 2nd statement. This is how it's done when you’re dissatisfied. This customer will spending her $$$ elsewhere."
227,2,"I have been a customer for years buying from Roaman's Women's Clothing, and will no longer be a customer of theirs! Was told when I received a coupon code that I could use it on a specific item, even called twice to verify. Then when time to use it would not allow me to use it. The item was excluded from the sale, after waiting WEEKS to buy this item that was normally $179.99 they told me that some items are not in the sale. Well they need to train their customer service people on this, because even the morning of trying to buy the item the lady told me that it should be allowing it to discount the price, and even gave me another code that was expired and would not allow me to use that one. Will never shop with them again!"
228,1,"Was told it would be $7.50 return fee total. I returned the low quality items. Then got a bill to $20.40. Customer service felt the need to argue with me that I needed to pay again for the shipping cost as well as the return fee. This company is so rude and nasty, I would rather let the $12.40 go into collections. I should charge them an aggravation fee. Sad thing is I'm disable so do all my shopping online. Never will buy from them again. They don't appreciate their customers. This woman Melinda desired she wanted to argue with me like I'm some child. At this rate it won't be long before Roaman's is out of business. People don't put yourself through it. There are too many good online companies out there. I HATE this experience, and this company. I am cutting my card into tiny pieces so they can stick them anywhere the sun doesn't shine."
229,3,"Used to order a lot from Roaman's. Nice clothes (when they fit). Ordered twice in July, both times the website froze up during the searching process, crashed, took FOREVER (customer service phone line backed up too). Took 2 HOURS (during a promotion) to place the 2nd order (about an hour for the 1st order). WOW, guess I REALLY wanted these items!! Tried multiple ways to order (my PC, cell phone, bla... bla). Outcome was the same. Because it kept freezing up, it changed the quantities and shipping info. Even when it looked like the info/changes had not gone through. Finally, I got everything ready to order, ordered, expedited shipping, so I could have for my high school reunion trip, and... it got worse. Even though I saved in cart, it froze up and popped me back to an earlier screen. WORST part was it changed the shipping preference back to the earliest preference, NOT the expedited I requested."
230,2,"This company is deceptive in the way they do returns and exchanges. They offer a 30-day FREE exchange, however when I used the enclosed form and returned it with a formal dress requesting an exchange for a smaller size, they sent me an email saying that my RETURN had been received and they showed they have charged me $7.50 for shipping on my returned item. I wrote an email to their customer service email and never heard a word. So I went out and reordered the dress in the size I had requested in my exchange. The dress arrived and fit. My credit card had been credited for the differences and recharged.
A week goes by and I notice another charge on my account pending and receive another email from Roaman's stating that my order has shipped. I again reached out by email as there is not a telephone number to call and the number listed on the charge on my credit card goes directly to a Direct Marketing company. Long story short, the dress showed up yesterday, I am refusing the delivery and have reported Roaman's to my credit card company as a disputed charge. Loved the dress, but will never do business again with this company based the lack of customer service and inability to speak with customer service."
231,2,"I bought some new clothes online from Roaman's catalogue for women. I just got the order yesterday. I did not open it until today. It was sealed in plastic and paper. Brand new. Well, I open the pants I got and noticed a smudge on the crotch. So I look inside and it is so disgusting and totally gross. It looked like someone wore them without underwear on and got whatever on the inside. So now here's the thing, I call them up and talked to customer service. I tell them there is this whatever (looks like you know what) in the pants. No blood... So she checks and says ""well, I am so sorry but we are sold out of that item in all sizes..."" I got angry and hung up... I called back and talked to someone else. He said they were totally out of the item as well. So he suggested they would give me a $7 refund on my card. Ok, so now I have to wash the item. I got it for a conference I am attending next Wednesday. I will never shop with Roamans.com again... So disgusting..."
232,1,"I placed an order on Dec 2, 2015, it shipped on Dec 6, 2015 and they charged my debit card on Dec 6, 2015. The tracking says it got to a HUB about an hour from my house on the 9th. It is now the 15th and it hasn't moved. I emailed customer service and their response was there is a backup at the HUB and if I don't get my package by the 26th to let them know! This is a Christmas gift! So I called through and talked to a ""supervisor"" who told me there was nothing they could do. I asked for my money back or reship same order by UPS not FedEx! He said they could not do that because they wouldn't have their package back, BUT IT'S OK FOR THEM TO HAVE MY MONEY AND I HAVE NO PRODUCT! He gave a number to Executive Communications to file a complaint. I will try that number but it is probably owned by them. I will NEVER order from them again! BEWARE!"
233,1,"Today, Nov 29 and tomorrow Nov 30, Roaman's is having a Cyber Monday 50% off sale. Sound good on the face of it, doesn't it? What Roaman's does it raise ""regular"" prices so that the 50% off price isn't such a bargain after all. I was waiting for this sale to purchase 5 shirts in different colors just like the one I bought recently during a 40% off sale. The shirt I bought at 40% off was a better final price that the same shirt at 50% off! The only way that can happen is that the regular price was raised. It isn't the actual dollar amount that makes me so angry. It is the intentional lying and deception. Please carefully check the prices before taking out your credit card. What you think is great bargain might not be at all. Roaman's lost a sale from me because of their dirty tricks."
234,2,"Roaman's catalog clearly states that Roaman's Platinum credit card holders receive certain benefits. Among those are ""Free standard shipping on orders of $75.00 or more after merchandise discount four times a year when you use your Roaman's Platinum card."" I wanted to take advantage of the offer for free shipping and placed an order over the phone in the amount of $132.64 using my Platinum card. My total came to $148.63. When I questioned the difference, I was told that I was being charged for shipping. It was explained to me by a Roaman's supervisor that the ""free shipping"" offer was at the discretion of the business and offered only at certain times of the year.
In other words, in order to take advantage of free shipping, I would have to place an order during one of these periods. I cancelled my order. I shop when I need something, not at the convenience of the merchant. In my opinion ethics were violated in not revealing the true nature of their offer for ""free shipping"". I will not be using this company again and plan to burn my credit card."
235,2,I ordered two tunic tops about three weeks ago - still have not received them. When I checked the status of my order it said it was just shipped from China. What??!! If I had known that I would have to wait at least a month for this order I never would have placed it. I am also questioning the quality of the items I will receive since they were made in China. I try to purchase products made in the USA. I will NEVER order from Zulily again.
236,2,"I ordered a personalized plaque with my daughter's name for her nursery and it is nothing like the advertised picture plus her name isn’t spelled correctly. When I sent them an email with the picture of what was sent and what it was actually supposed to spell they offered me a courtesy store credit. Once I told them I’d like my refund sent to my bank account because I no longer wish to do business with Zulily or order anything else from their website due to such an inconvenience, I was still told that I’m being offered a courtesy store credit and that the name says what it is supposed to say."
237,3,"In May, several orders were placed on my Zulily account that totaled over $1,000 within a span of a few hours. Since I have alerts set up on my accounts, I called both my credit card company and Zulily to advise them of the fraud. My credit card company cancelled my account and issued a new card. Zulily said they would cancel all transactions (which were addressed to Cypress TX - which should have set up a flag?) and they also closed my account. However, during the next billing cycle, Zulily charged my credit card for some of the items. I had to call my credit card company again and dispute the charges.
I called Zulily and they said that disputing the charges was the best route. My Credit Card company is going to take another week to investigate. While waiting on hold for Zulily, their policy is to take orders and then place the order with the vendor to make the items, so shipping is usually delayed for a few weeks. How did these items get expedited to ship the next day? Something doesn't seem quite right that I should have to keep beating back these fraudulent charges."
238,1,"If I could give them 0 stars I would!! I ordered an Dusty Rose Maxi Dress for my pregnancy, when I received it I tried it on and it was nothing like the picture or what I was expecting. I returned it expecting my money back on my original payment method minus the shipping I paid (been 3 weeks). I been e-mailing customer service for weeks and they did not resolve my problem, and they tell me the same thing that I have a store credit of $7.04?? I did not ask for store credit and never even wore this dress more than 1 minute to try it on. Right when I received it in the mail I sent it right back.
Customer service at Zulily is so crappy and do not help you. They did not explain the return or exchanges and when I read it before I purchased it said I could get my money with no hassle and easy returns which is a LIE!! They scammed me out of a purchase around $24 and kept the shipping for a re-stocking fee plus customer service said I can either get the $15.99 for the dress for store credit or only get the $7.04 back on my original payment method. Which is pretty messed up when I received an e-mail saying I would get it back from the original payment method. I e-mailed customer service saying I will never shop with them again. Also, very unsatisfied customer. WASTE OF MONEY!!! If I were you I would not buy from them! From my personal experience lesson learned. Just waiting for my $7.04 refund now to my bank account. If not I will be calling them back."
239,1,"This was my second month using this service. I had requested to be in the lowest price range but the clothes I received were out of my range. Because of my weight, they assumed I was plus sized. They do not list sizes on the clothing pictures. They choose sizes for you. Their edits are very large (15 items). So in my last one I was being sent 3 tops, 5 pairs of wide legged pants in black, 3 skirts, 4 dresses. They were all similar!!! I called to cancel and they apologized (that is a well used phrase for them!). Told I would not receive the box. Well guess what!!! The box is still coming!!! I am sending it right back! I found the customer service to be very poor! Don’t use them!!!"
240,1,"Do NOT shop at the Dressbarn in Winter Gardens FL. The staff this Saturday were disrespectful and insulting. To top it off, I ordered 2 shirts online on a Sunday, I needed them for an event on the following Friday so thinking shipping would be fast, I had them sent to this store, which is the closest to where I live, about 30-40-minute drive. Loved one of the shirts so much that I decided to go the Wednesday before the arrival date to try them on. The staff that day were amazing, I explained my situation and they were very helpful. Found me tons of items to try and ended up buying like 10 items more. I was assured that when the online order arrived, I would be able to return the shirt I re-purchased."
241,1,"On 4/4/18 while traveling for a conference I used the hotel laundry facility to do a load of laundry. I was traveling light and had brought a black and tan pair of Dressbarn pants knowing that I could mix and match for the week. Both pairs of pants shrunk causing me to take a cab to a local store and spend money purchasing new pants to get through the remainder of the conference. On 4/5/18, I called customer service to return or replace the pants. I explained that there was no indication on the tag that shrinkage may occur and was very disappointing that the product had let me down. I was read a scripted response from a call center employee and she was unwilling to deviate from her script to offer me any assistance. The return policy states that returns can be made within 60 days (I purchased them on Feb 19th) so, I am well within the 60 days however, because they had been worn and the tags removed, I was not able to return them. I asked for them to be replaced and again referring to her script, she was unable to help me. I asked to speak to a supervisor. The ""supervisor"" which come to find out was not, read the same script. I tried to have a reasonable conversation but it is hard when employees are scripted. After a very frustrating conversation, where I was told there were NO supervisors available ""because they are all in a meeting"", I was told that I was going to be put on hold ""probably for a long time"" while she waited for a supervisor, she was rude. Finally a woman named McKaila came on the line. She was not able to assist and made it clear that the call center does not have any authority to truly assist the customer. This is shameful, Dressbarn must empower their employees to provide customer service. It was very clear to me that this call center was nothing but an automated center in which the standard is NO. I will not support a company that does not care for the customer and employs low paid, low impact personnel to read scripts to people vs. talking to the customer and standing behind their products and service. This whole experience has shown me what kind of company Dressbarn is and I will make sure I inform my friends and network what a poorly run company this is."
242,3,"I have purchased a lot of nice things from Dressbarn but found that a pair of pants I had bought were not going to work for me. I took them back to the store and explained to the person helping me that I had tried them on twice and realized I was not happy with them and wouldn't wear them. She had a distrustful attitude toward me from the get-go. The first thing she asked, in not a very nice way, was if I had worn them. I told her I had not. She then said she could not take them back because the tags were off. I had a receipt and I did not see how I could not return them if I had the receipt.
She then informed me that it was on the back of the receipt that the tags must be on the item. I told her it never occurred to me to read the back of my receipt and she informed me that was my contract!! I need a contract to buy a pair of pants!!? She picked up the pants again and said, ""you didn't wear these???"" I am not sure how I kept my cool but I did and after a long time and a lot of stalling and treating me like I was trying to pull something I did get my refund. After reading some of the other reviews I see that this kind of treatment is not an uncommon occurrence."
243,2,"First let me say I don't shop anywhere else but Dressbarn, not anymore. I bought a pair of black crop pants. I wore them twice and I felt something weird and I noticed that the whole inside of the leg was shredding. I went back to the San Dimas store in CA. I picked up another pair just like it to do an exchange. The manager said (we don't take back damaged items). I said I only wore them twice and she repeated herself. I said ""I heard you might be closing"" and she said ""yes probably"" and then discarded me and walked away. I can tell you that I shopped there so much they knew my name. I am going to call corporate. What really made me angry was her disrespect for me. I spent $40.00 on these pants."
244,2,"I have been a loyal and active customer of Dressbarn for almost 10 years. What happened today was the only bad experience I have ever had at Dressbarn. I have never had any problems with the store I shop at in Laurel, MD, but today was so surprising and made me rethink the value they place on customer relations.
I bought a top for my mum with couple of other garments and tried to return the top, which was NEVER worn (obviously so) with tags and receipt intact, only to be told that the return cannot be processed as it ""appears"" to have been worn because it smells. Customers try on garments in stores and I'm sure some wear heavy perfumes or have body odor. We normally just pick a clothing off the rack that we like. I did not know when it became a requirement for DB that customers smell clothes before buying otherwise they will be unable to return due to the smell of the garment. I find this preposterous as I was at a loss.
Bear in mind that it was even confirmed by customer service after calling to make a complaint that my record shows that I am a very active customer with little or no returns. I sometimes do exchanges only for size changes. I have a Credit Card with DB that I pay on time on, and even take visiting family members to shop there. Just within these past 2 weeks, my sister and mum made purchases to the tune of almost $500. It is so unfair to be looked in the face and told you did something you didn't do especially when your record even speaks for itself.
I definitely will no longer be shopping here again. I will pay off my credit card with DB ($180 or so) and close the card. I honestly do not want to have anything to do with a store that treats its loyal customers like trash. My mother still loves the store. That is the only store she gets all her garments from when she is town with me, which is rather unfortunate. I waited for over 30 minutes this morning for the store to open up and quite frankly, the store manager, who I believe did not do her job well, really messed up my day. She readily and gleefully gave me her name to call customer service. I guess it is because she probably knows the company's customer service wouldn't do anything, which was exactly what happened."
245,2,"I've shopped at Dressbarn on various occasions in the stores, but in April I decided to order two dresses online through their website. I thought I was getting a deal when the shipping charges were free; however, it took three weeks for me to get the items. I bought items from two other stores through their websites at the same time; their shipping fees were also free; but I received those items within 7 days of order. Gladly I wasn't in any hurry for the items; however, I didn't like the dresses and had to return them. Here's where the problem began.
With the shipping return label that is provided there is no way to track the package further than post office, because that package is passed onto another shipping company and that tracking number is not available to you. I mailed the package back on May 1 and still have not received my refund. In contacting customer service, I was told it takes at least 30 days to receive a refund. Next week will be the thirty-day mark and I hope I to receive my refund by then. Regardless, I won't be using Dressbarn's online ordering system again."
246,2,"This is my first time writing a review as to clothing. I thought I had finally found a store that had my style of clothing. This summer I purchased approximately 6-7 tops at DressBarn and I received many compliments on them. The problem is after a few washings the stitching around the neck, sleeves, hem, etc. started unraveling. Rather than pay extra money to a seamstress to repair the tops, I gave them to a thrift store and cut my losses. I had no receipts to return the tops to the store. My last purchase at DressBarn was skinny jeans, that I love, but I'm concerned the jeans may fall apart after a few washings. Sad to say, I doubt if I will buy any future clothing at DressBarn. It's too bad because I do love the styles but the quality is poor."
247,2,"I purchased an item at Dressbarn that I decided not to keep and never even wore it. I went back the very next day to return the item. When I took the item out of the bag, I somehow lost the tags that were not attached any longer. I told the lady at the counter that they must have fallen out at home or in my car that I would look for them and bring them back. The lady said that they could not take them back because even if I found the tags, they were not still attached to the garment and it was policy not to take them back unless the tags were still attached. I explained to the lady that the tags had fallen off the item when I tried them on in the dressing room the day before and that the lady who cashed me out said it wasn't a problem and just scanned the price and threw the loose tags in the bag with the item.
This very rude lady then told me that all employees reattach the tags before a customer leaves so there is no problem with returns. I was so upset at this point! This rude person was basically calling me a liar! I again told her that the lady did NOT reattach the tags and that I walked out of the store with them like that. She pushed the item back at me and said she would not accept them without tags. I felt so disrespected as a customer. I drove all the way home and looked everywhere and of course I couldn't find them so I'm stuck with merchandise I will never use. At that point, however, I was more upset they treated me so badly. I was looking forward to purchasing some of the wonderfully colorful blouses they had there and now I will never step foot in that store again! Customer Service is outrageous!"
248,2,I purchased a faux leather jacket online and had it delivered to the store for pick up. When I checked out online I had an option to use a credit card or PayPal. I used PayPal and what a mistake. I tried to return the jacket back to the store because it does not lay right when you have it on and I was told that because I used PayPal that I could only get store credit. When I got back home I went on live chat and ask why it was that way and they said PayPal is third party. I stated that they should have that on the web page and I was told they did. They provided me with the web address and I went to that site and could not find anything explaining that if you use PayPal you can only get store credit! On top of that when I ask why on live chat they replied to me like it was all my fault. No apology at all! I will not shop there again!!
249,3,"Hi my name is Suzan. I went to Ross today 2 days back and bought a cologne, I thought it was for men so I bought it for my husband. I went home and then open just the plastic and I was reading the complete instruction to see if it was for men or women, then I found out it was for women so I can the next day which is today and went to return and exchange line, the manager name ""Marcela"", said she can't exchange because we just open the plastic. So I want told her I want it to talk to the manager, she said in a rude way that she's a manager. And she object is and said if the plastic is open or if it's used it can't return or exchanged."
250,3,"I bought a very large rug in Ross for Less. I realized after 2 days when I was about installing my new rug that the cashier forgot to remove to anti theft tag. So on 03/18/2018 at noon, I went back to Ross for Less located at 3851 Oakwood Blvd, Hollywood, FL 33020 and I spoke DIRECTLY to the Security Guard at the Entrance store, the security guard was very nice and took me to a cashier who forward me to another cashier by the name of NADECHE, she was very rude and refuses to remove the anti theft tag telling me that I need the receipt. So I nicely explained her that I cannot find the receipt, she told me in a very rude way that she cannot help me.
Then I asked for the Store Manager, she answered that SHE IS the Store Manager and again refuses to remove the Anti-theft tag that one of the cashiers forgot to remove during the sale. It was a very frustrating experience due to the fact that I was not responsible about the Anti theft tag removal. Now I find myself with an expensive large rug that I cannot use..."
251,1,Just went to Chili’s Harrisonburg Va and the worst experience ever. We won’t ever go back there! I went to the restroom and when I came back to go to my table I walked by the kitchen and a waitress getting ready to take food to a table had her hands in the food eating from the customers dish and didn’t think a thing about it and there were 2 other employees right next to her didn’t say a word. Gross!!! I called over the manager and he could care less. Must be a common practice for their employees to eat and take from the customers plates and eat their food prior to serving it.
252,2,"I could not believe that on Saturday before Father's Day that this Chili's at ROSENBERG, TEXAS had no Ribs of any kind to fill orders. I ordered the Big Mouth Bites and the PICK 2 Make It A Combo (6oz steak & shrimp). The Big Mouth Bites were to have bacon, cheese, sautéed onions & ranch dressing. When I got home the bites had no ranch dressing, no onions and the bacon was a joke (bacon bits). They had forgotten the shrimp on the Combo meal, so I waited while they fixed them. When I got home the shrimp were half raw and the steak was tough. I do not plan to go to this place again unless they do a better job. I did call the manager on duty."
253,2,"I visited the Chili's on State Farm Parkway in Homewood Al on May 18 at 3: 00 pm. Upon arrival I walked in to the take out side of the restaurant, the manager was showing an employee something on the computer. No one acknowledge I was standing there, or greeted me, or even said one minute. I proceeded to look at the menu and asked the cashier about menu items. I asked her what came with the Triple Dipper. She told me she didn't know. I placed my order and came back to pick it up. When I arrived home I looked at my order and it wasn't<U+200B> prepared well at all. I ordered the rib eye meal with potatoes and broccoli. There was no broccoli. I ordered the quesadillas. They were overcooked. I ordered the Triple Dipper. It had no dipping sauces. Everything was wrong. Worst 44 dollars spent. I will never go to this location again."
254,2,"My special needs daughter and myself went to this Chili's on Navarro St in Victoria Texas on Saturday, May 5, 2018. We walked in and a woman and young girl, around 9-10 were behind the counter. The woman took our name for the wait and the girl just stared at my daughter. We had to wait outside because the benches inside were full. Our 10 minute wait time went into 20 minutes. I went in and asked about our table, the woman said she called our name. I asked her if she bothered to check outside, she said she didn't think to do that. Really? You have enough seats for maybe 6 people and at least 10 of us were waiting, where do you think we would be. Others were outside waiting as well.
She sat us in the bar area. After 10 minutes, our waitress named Rosa took our order. Waited 15 minutes for our food. Once the food came, we never saw Rosa again. She never checked back with us to see how our order was or to see if we needed anything else. I paid with the the self pay machine at the table, grabbed a to go box for my daughter's leftovers and left. How's that for customer service?? Will never go back to this place."
255,2,"I don't care for Chili's as the food is mediocre at best, I tend to get diarrhea from the food, and the service is not consistent. But, my son loves it, so I cave in now and then and go. The food and service was mediocre, as usual. I paid with my debit card on that little table top machine. Later that night my bank emailed me about 5 suspicious transactions on my account. Whoever got my debit card number wiped my bank account out. I didn't use my card any other place that day or the day before, so I have to assume the table top payment machine had a skimmer on it.
Fortunately, my bank is not holding me responsible for the charges and I will have my money back in my account in 5 business days. I called the manager of Chili's the next day to warn him about his tabletop payment machines. He refused to believe it could have been his machine. He said in the two years they have had those machines this has never happened. I can't prove that it happened at Chili's, but I don't know how else it could have happened. He thanked me for the warning, but I doubt he will do anything to help protect his customers. My son will just have to learn to live without Chili's."
256,2,"I had no complaint about the service, the waitress and other staff were very nice. The food is bland and fair at best. There is not much selection on the menu. On our table, there was an electronic device that allows you to sign up to become a member, pay your bill and play games. While waiting for the food to arrive, I played a game. To my shock, they charge for this. I had no idea. Nothing was mentioned anywhere about there being a fee. I have seen little games at other places I had been to and there was never a fee. That was the final straw for me. I went there because someone gave me a gift card but as far as I am concerned, I won't be back."
257,3,"Unfortunately the service at Chili's is inconsistent. I once a week ago and had a wonderful experience than this past Sunday. My daughter, mother and friend went and had a horrible experience. They went Sunday around 2 p.m. There was a female manager and a short waitress blonde hair who treated them terribly. The waitress overcharge them, double charge them, upcharge them without letting them know. When brought to her attention she made excuses and actually blamed them saying they probably touched something on the little kiosk that they keep on the tables. Instead of taking responsibility for her mistake and fixing it she had them wait there for an extensive amount of time and the manager didn't really seem to care. Very sad that the service is so inconsistent. This was the Chili's in Pennsylvania in the Tannersville area."
258,2,"I went to Chili's (Diamond Bar, CA) last night with my son. I am already apprehensive about going there because the quality of the food and the service has gone way done in the past couple of years. We get seated and wait at least 5 or 10 minutes before our drinks even come out. We order and wait another good 20 - 25 minutes for the food. I ordered the sirloin steak, medium well. Well when I get it, it looks rather pale and almost as if it were boiled. No grill marks on it whatsoever. It didn't even look like a steak, it looked like a blob of putty on my plate. I go to cut into it and it is completely raw/rare. It starts to bleed all over my mashed potatoes and corn. I ate those right away and waited about 15 more minutes before my waitress ever came back to check on my food, by this time I am aggravated and grossed out. She finally comes over and I show her the steak and I tell her I can't eat it because it is way too bloody.
She takes it back to the kitchen, and she did ask me if I wanted a soup or salad while I waited but I declined. I just wanted my steak and to get out of there. It finally arrives about another 5 or 10 minutes later and they ask me to cut into it to see if it is cooked correctly. It was, but it was the toughest, rubberiest, chewiest steak I have ever eaten. I chewed certain pieces for what seemed like 2 or 3 minutes until I finally spit them out into my napkin. What a huge disappointment in the steak. And I've been disappointed by their steaks before so I kind of kick myself in the butt for even ordering them and trying to give them another chance. I don 't know what's going on with Chili's lately but my last 5 trips, at least, have been substandard. Seriously not going back anytime soon. Maybe ever."
259,3,"We were at Chili's Khalidiyah Mall last Friday 19th Jan 2018 and it was really a BAD experience. We asked for New York Steak and it came as if it is BOILED, no taste, no herbs, no salt. The mashed potato was as if it is the leftover collected. We asked for the sauce. They said, ""You will need to pay for sauce!!"" We asked for the standard steak sauce in bottle. They said, ""Sorry not available."" My husband went to the manager at the branch asking for money refund as we didn’t see any value and he didn’t eat his meal as the food was really awful, she said, ""Sorry we can't. We can change only."" Neither the waiter nor the manager cared about people's satisfaction and it is really bad to see the Quality of Chili's declining that way."
260,2,"On this day December 16, 2017 I went for a visit at Chili's with my daughters to relax out and it was the worst experience ever. First of all when we arrived we were seated fast then the waiter was Bobby came to the table, introduced himself and asked if we were ready to order. We stated, “Give us a minute” but we ordered the drinks. He brought the drinks without the straws so we then asked him for the straws. He passed our table at least 4 times going other places for other customers and then next he brought our appetizers out which didn't bring our straws nor silverware out and then he said, “Huh I need to get silverware and straws?” We were just sitting there waiting all that time and then he came back with the stuff and few minutes later here he come with our meals which we were trying to finish the appetizers and the meal just sitting losing temperature.
We ate our food. He wasn't acting like he wanted to be bothered with us really. I almost just walked out of the place. I was so unhappy. Finally he came and we were ready to pay so I handed him my gift card and cash. Well I knew I last had 22.18 left on my card so she, he came back I asked him to see a receipt because I didn't feel the amount of change wasn't right so he mumbled again. Hmmm when he came back he said, “You had 11.08 on your card.” So my change was 2.12 which he still didn't leave the 12 cents which at that time I was feed up with him and the point of it all is that everything was just horrible. One thing after the other and I surely don't want to visit again just poor customer service and I am a Nutrition Manager and we serve the same way at our facility in course so I know the ropes that place need a major turnaround if the staff all work that way."
261,3,"I tried Chili's for the first time with my daughter. We were sat next to a booth that was closed off with buckets beside it to catch water from a leaky roof... Nasty! We both order Fajitas and a appetizer. We requested the app have the guacamole removed, it was still put on there. Her meal came out first and was very charred and missing the pico from the beans. I had to wait 10 mins for mine. When mine finally arrived, there were no limes with it. The server suggested I use the limes from my drink, and I quote ""take it from your drink"" with a smile she said. This was the worst experience ever! I did speak with the manager Zack. He said he would speak with the server and apologized and offered to send Gift Cards to cover our next meal. Since he handled it so well we will give Chili's another try. I will also write another review as well with that experience."
262,2,"I ordered a bacon, cheese and spinach omelette and was told they don't allow you to build your own omelette. When I attempted to leave I was told they would make my omelette as requested. I received an egg with spinach a piece of bacon on top with a few sprinkles of onions. The waiter told three other employees about me and they stood in the hallway just starring and whispering. The fork wrapped in the napkin was dirty. I Will never go to another Denny's because they truly left a bad taste in my mouth."
263,2,"Waited 10 mins to be seated, no one around. Once seated and ordered ahead of three other people. We waited 40 mins for our food, a grand slam breakfast meal, while they all received a dinner meal which should have taken longer to cook and received theirs before we received ours. The food was not HOT, sausage could have been cooked longer as well as the hash browns, I ordered over easy eggs, but yolk had been broken and slightly well done. Never going back."
264,3,"We sat down and three other groups were seated after us but ordered before us! We sat and waited and finally got someone’s attention. His response was “wait a minute”. Then we ordered build your own slam. We both ordered the same things. There was a picture of the options. We ordered the two pancakes, hash browns, two eggs over medium, and the two biscuits as shown on website build your own slam. We got two of everything except one biscuit even though the choices pictured showed two. Waiter said only one. I asked for the manager and he said it was a side order that had two."
265,3,"Today we visited Denny’s store 9284. OMG. It was so hot in there. It was miserable. I spoke to manager. She stated air has been out for 2 months. This makes no sense. Customer & employees are uncomfortable. I really don’t think corporate cares about anything but making money. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this really messes with the morale of employees. They are hot and irritated. Come on. Really!!! I was told employees and customers have been complaining for the past 2 months and nothing has been done.
I placed a call to corporate to speak with someone. The person that handles complaints was out to lunch. Her name is Gabby. I provided receptionist my name and call back number. If I don’t receive a call before end of day I will be calling back until this is taken care of... If you usually visit the Denny’s in Murphy, Texas please take the time to stand up for the employees and help get the air fixed... If you would like to call number... Thank you."
266,3,"The price of their food, run-of-the-mill food, has skyrocketed! I just wanted a hamburger. One burger that is not cooked to order, being that they do not ask how you want the meat cooked, was just under 11.00 dollars. I tried to get a ""new"" featured burger, which in the picture on the menu showed bacon cheddar tots. Well, the joke's on you should you order it as the picture depicts. It is an upcharge for these 6 tiny bacon cheddar tots. Even more irksome, was when the order was placed, the server did not care to let me know about such an upcharge. I requested that the burger not have caramelized onions, tomatoes, or pickles, but suffice it to say, this did not decrease the cost of the burger.
The server and the cook did do the order as requested, however I ate the entirety of the meal, but was not asked whether or not I was enjoying it while eating it. I received the receipt, then found the aforementioned upcharge on the meal. I said this wasn't right and felt as though such dishonesty is the same as stealing. The server shrugged and apologized. This did not mitigate the price listed on the bill. After taxes, it was over 12.00 U. S. dollars. I decided to decline leaving a tip. This is very atypical for me, however, with the rumored raises serving staff has gotten, not by my choice, I no longer feel it prudent to add to it with a tip. Particularly after this kind of service was given. If a large company like this chose to grant such raises, should the consumer be picking up the tab with overpriced menu items? This of course is a rhetorical question."
267,3,My family have always went Denny's on payday. We never had a lot of problem with this restaurants. But we had one waiter take our drink but we didn't get them until about twenty mins until a another waiter walked in and then we got our drink. The second waiter took our orders since the first one (Brittany) didn't give our drinks or even take our order. And then once we got our food my daughter had to eat with her hands bc there was no forks or nothing giving to us. And we had to asked the waiter in the pink shirt two times to bring us some... But the good news the food was great. But next I just going to see if Amber or Hannah I think the second girl name is at works. Becasue our family wouldn't of been treating like this at all. But anyway food was awesome but need to work our y'all waiters' skills. Thanks.
268,1,"Don't ever go to the Denny's on Zaragoza in the Plaza de Flores. We usually go there once a week and have tremendous service, but this time we went to really horrible service from the waiter and the manager. The waiter never refilled our drinks until we had to ask him, he kept telling us that we couldn't do certain things to our order because he wasn't allowed, and he overcharged us on drinks. We go to check out and the manager tells us that we don't qualify for the kids eat free that are from 4 to 10 when I tried to explain it to her that we order the same thing weekly and never had this problem. Her response was, ""It isn't my fault that the other managers don't do their job right."" Support and educate your customers about changes and policy because it isn't their fault that not everyone is on the same page."
269,1,"Ordered the new dulce de leche crunch pancakes that normally costs $6.79. As you can see from the photo, the pancakes look NOTHING like the picture shows in their menu or on website. No whipped topping, cinnamon clearly on in the center of the pancakes and the rest is plain. Total joke. The restaurant should be ashamed to be so deceiving. I've always disliked Denny's and never eat there and this experience definitely seals that. Thankfully T-Mobile paid for this. Very disappointed!"
270,3,"I went to the Manchester Friendly's for breakfast with my granddaughter and was surprised at the new changes. Instead of having a hostess seat us we had to wait in line to put in our order. We were then given a number and chose a table. The employee came to our table and gave us silverware and then when the order was ready brought to our table. She also took our dishes when we were done. My granddaughter who is 10 years old didn’t like the way it was done also as we have been a customer many times when a kiosk was on the table and we put our own orders in with the waitress.
We noticed that there were only 4 other groups there and we were used to having a large number of groups at the tables. We left a tip for the employee and asked if she was getting any tips this way and she said sometimes she does and sometimes not. We feel this new way isn’t very friendly and certainly not good for the waitress since this probably is her livelihood. Not sure if I will go back since we liked the original way and prefer waitress input - getting recommendations etc. Hope this way won't continue."
271,1,"My friends and I went to the Friendly's on the Mohawk Trail in Greenfield, MA for breakfast. There appeared to be only one waitress working. Our silverware was dirty with old food stuck on it. I ordered a garden veggie omelet without mushrooms. It came back with mushrooms on it and in it and I sent it back. I then got back my same omelet that was reheated (no garnish on top as I had removed it as it included mushrooms). I opened the omelet and it still had some of the mushrooms in it. I sent it back and said I didn't want any food replacement! My friends had finished eating at this point. One of my friend's eggs were rubbery and my others friend's bacon (ordered extra crispy) was rubbery. The manager was kind enough to take my meal and my coffee off our order. Haha. This place was a joke and I will never go back again. I will also recommend that any of my friends and family avoid this establishment!!!"
272,2,"I sent my husband out to purchase an ice cream cake at Friendly's for an upcoming birthday celebration. He came home with a lovely cake, but it had no writing on it - no greeting or names! I asked him what happened, and he said that the hostess said that they no longer write on cakes, since ""corporate"" does not give them the supplies to do so. I called the restaurant and complained, and they verified this information. Needless to say, the cake was quickly returned. They couldn't care less. This was supposed to be part of a celebratory meal at our home. I do not have the supplies or skill to write on cakes. That is why I purchase them! This is a special treat. I will not be patronizing this chain in the future. As a further comment, we have noticed that their service has been declining and their food is increasingly unhealthy."
273,3,"On September 15, I went to Friendly's with my husband and 2 friends and I was very disappointed. I usually go to Friendly's with my 4 grandchildren, daughter and son in law and husband and everything is usually okay. We went for the $2 quarter pounder burgers and fountain drinks. The waitress was nice and tried, but the experience was terrible.
We ordered 4 $2 burgers. We were told $.99 for French fries, $1.99 for waffle fries and $2.49 for a salad. My husband and friend ordered the salad. My friend and I ordered the fries. The waitress came back and said the salad would be $3.69. My husband and my friend changed to fries. We ordered 1 diet coke and 2 lemonades. I order iced tea and was told that is not included. We got square hamburgers that were not quarter pounders and no taste. We then ordered dessert. The bill came and the fries were now $1.99 each. We told the waitress and she said they changed the price. They would not take it off the bill. When we left, the sign said iced tea was included. I am totally upset about the entire situation."
274,1,"I can't believe this place still has franchises open. It is absolutely horrible. Friendly's??? How about unorganized, terribly managed and unfairly priced. I watched our waitress seat people, including us, take orders at about 10 tables, run food to tables that were not hers and her own, buss and clean tables (hers and not hers), she said she would be back with our ice creams after SHE had to make them and I even think she had to go in the kitchen and make some of her own food for her tables. Meanwhile, I never saw a manager until this big blond lady came out of the back to use the bathroom.
She went past a table and grabbed a credit card receipt and handed it to our waitress while she was talking to us and said ""make sure you close this out as soon as possible"". I don't know what that really means but our poor waitress is literally running this restaurant and I'm assuming the manager only wants $ or has some kind of quota. What a lazy piece of crap! She could of grabbed a dirty glass or threw away the napkins but NO! Needless to say our waitress was great considering her endless duties. I feel bad for the people that work there. Not to mention, the food sucks!!! 10 for a burger with nasty cold fries. I've had better in a hospital. This place sucks and their management should be ashamed of themselves. You will go down. Hopefully soon."
275,3,"My family and I went to Friendly's Restaurant in Norwood, MA recently and had a terrible experience in almost every way. First, it took about 15-20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and come take our drink order. When I asked a waitress about it, the waitress was very rude and unfriendly. The funny thing is that it was lunch time, but there were not too many people in the restaurant that day at all. My family was already complaining about how Friendly's was notoriously slow, but this visit was ridiculous. We waited about 1 hour for our food (4 people all simple orders), and again, not super busy. The waitress did not visit the table even once during that time and did not appear to have any people skills or friendliness skills, ironically. She didn't come once in the entire meal to ask us about drink refills. She seemed bothered to even stop by.
We go out a lot to different restaurants, and this was one of the worst experiences we have had, if not the worst in a long time. The worst waitress we have had too. When the food finally did arrive, it was wrong on multiple accounts. I ordered the crispy chicken breast sandwich, and what I received were three sad chicken fingers on a hamburger bun. I called back the waitress and asked her about it, and she said they ran out of the crispy grilled chicken. Frustrated, I said, ""Oh, Really? So, you just give me chicken fingers without telling me you ran out of my meal and without informing me that you were giving me something else? If I wanted chicken fingers, I would have ordered them..."" To me, this was the antithesis of not caring.
Next, my wife ordered the Chicken Bacon Ranch salad with grilled chicken. It was missing the tortilla chips. It was missing the egg. It came with crispy chicken instead of grilled. And, it was the saddest looking salad I've even seen bar none; and this is coming from someone who worked in restaurants for nearly 10 years. There is more, but I think everyone gets the point and would agree that there was no excuse for this disastrous kind of service. So unfriendly. So not interested in serving us. So unprofessional. And, sooo long of a wait for absolutely no reason.
I thought the service was bad. Apparently, it wasn't as bad as Friendly's management who never even responded to this letter I send them, which is why I'm putting it here. Chipotle responded to my high praises of them the next day and to a recent complaint the same day. That is a business. Friendly's has become a disaster. No wonder so many of them are closing..."
276,3,"My fiancee prepaid for my rental car. When I picked it up at Ontario Airport I had to provide a card in my name since she was not there at the time of pick up. I asked if I would be charge and the customer service representative told me ""No, the balance is $0, your card is needed in case of any damages or if the car is returned with less than a full tank of gas."" Six days after I returned the car I was charged for the rental. After speaking with a customer service agent at Ontario Airport who verified my fiancee's card was on the account I was told that a manager would contact me. When the manager contacted me I was told that my fiancee's card was removed from the account. They told me I would not receive a refund because the account was closed. I had been a loyal customer for years. It is nice to know they value money over their customers."
277,1,"The experience I had with this rental car company was awful. You can book a reservation but when you go to pick up your car you must have a major credit card which you are not told that when booking the reservation. I was going to a family reunion and when I went to the location to pick up the vehicle in West Palm Beach, Florida, I wanted to use my debit card which they wouldn’t accept, and I was not told that information when making the reservation. I was very upset and had to go to another car rental place which put me behind by about 3 hours. I will never recommend National Car Rental to anybody ever..."
278,1,"I just received a bill from National - THREE months after I rented a vehicle for four days in Kalispell Montana. The bill was for $983.90 for a LESS THAN 1/2"" chip in the windshield. I was not notified of this nor was I contacted to discuss this ""CLAIM"" and how it was to be handled. They included an invoice from Safelite auto glass for $874.90 - when I obtained a quote for cash from Safelite - it was for $310.00. National then added their own ""fees"" to this as well. Everything about this screams scam and ripoff.
When you rent a vehicle you are told to report everything larger than a quarter. This chip (not a star) was less than 1/2"" in length, and it was not in the driver's line of sight. National took it upon themselves to replace the entire windshield, and send a ridiculous bill. Do not rent from this company! I rent cars about 6 times a year and this is a first!!!"
279,1,"BEWARE! I was stuck in a snowstorm in Duluth, Minnesota. We received word that our flight to Minneapolis had been cancelled. Having to make a split decision to drive through the snow to Minneapolis to try and catch our connecting flight in Minneapolis, I called National to tell them we would be returning the car because of the problems with the flights to Minneapolis (2 hours away). They had no mercy on me and charge me $300 for the change. I expected a penalty but not 447% of the daily rental price. And of course had I made a regular reservation of the same journey, it would not have been $300.00. I called and emailed National but they did not care that this was the largest storm in the area since 2014 nor did they care about my situation. So beware... They are all about the money and do not care about the customer!!!"
280,1,"I recently rented a car in San Antonio on Dec 29th, I dropped it off in Austin (returned it). The Austin location didn't process the return properly and I was charged an extra week for the rental. I have called numerous numbers, departments and although they are all very pleasant - they are trained to come across as helpful - they did not rectify the situation... So due to their inept processing, their mistake, my rental currently sits on my credit card at $1,001.00. Amazing, and I rent 75ish cars a year at least from this company all over North America. I can't imagine how they treat others that aren't as frequent a renter. Avis Here I come... Very disappointed in National Run Around and Terribly inefficient Customer Service... They just blow smoke and sugar coat, I will take my business elsewhere."
281,1,"What a nightmare dealing with this company has been. I was billed for damage to the car that I did not do. I took pictures of the car a few minutes after I picked it up that showed a very small crease in a fender that I had not noticed in the dark parking garage where it was parked. Upon returning the car, the receiving agent never saw the damage and I pointed it out to him. The process after that has been the nightmare. I was told lie after lie. Airport car rental managers to agents at the damage recovery unit. Almost as if they have been coached. Never again will I rent a car from National."
282,3,"I really don’t know what’s their point to have a grace period. It says there is a 29 min grace period. Between 29 min and 2 hour 30 min there will be an hourly charge. I was late for less than 2 hours and got a full day charge because the hourly rate is half of the daily price and nobody has informed me about this. Customer service said when you are late for over 1.5 hour. It will count as 2 hours. So basically it means if you are over 1.5 hours late, there will be a whole day charge.
The grace period showed online is just a joke. Customer service are all Indian accent and really hard to understand and doesn’t seem want help and just tell me to ask local position. And the local phone cannot be reached so I drove all the way to the airport. The guy there was nice and tried to help us but National has a really bad system. When they put my name on the computer they couldn’t find my reservation but when I call them they could find the reservation although it also took them a long time. And he told me hourly rate is half of the daily rate."
283,1,"I made my reservation online and knew I would need a “credit card” to get a car as per usual. In the recent past that has always meant any card with a major credit card symbol on it, including a debit card (I prefer not to have a credit card). After arriving at the airport to get my car I was told that I was not able to rent a car as the policy had changed in June. Now I’m totally stranded. They would not take cash, they would not take a card over the phone, they would not let someone make the reservation at another location in person with a card. The major issue was how much they “enjoyed” shooting down any possible option I could think of.
The customer service line sent me out of country and they refused to help, only referring me back to the local office. At every turn nobody would help and could have cared less that I was stranded. I will never choose National, Alamo, Budget, Enterprise again as they are all one company. I will be telling my story probably for the rest of my life every time “car rental” comes up."
284,1,"We rented a car six months before traveling to Venice and there was only one attendant at the counter. She spent 45 min. with one customer while 6 others were waiting in sweltering heat. It was finally our turn and she refused to give us a car because I am 80 years old. AGE DISCRIMINATION! I am extremely fit and walk 14 kilometers a day and am mentally fit. Years of experience with no accident, but refused a car not on ability, but AGE. They will however rent to 18-year-old with no experience. We were shocked and stranded in Venice with no car. The result was that we had to pay $566 extra Canadian dollars for 12 days to get a car through Hertz, since we had no reservation. Our total cost was $1,736. for 12 days. NEVER EVER RENT FROM NATIONAL."
285,3,"I reserved a vehicle 15 days ago to be picked up on 07/27/17. I told the clerk I would pick up between 12 and 1:00 p.m. When I arrived, it was 11:55. They first tried to overcharge me, but I showed the receipt with the quoted price. Then I was told I was an hour early, my vehicle wasn't ready. I reminded the person that I reserved that vehicle 15 days ago, an hour early shouldn't matter. She told me it hadn't even been returned by the previous person. So, I was supposed to wait for an hour because the vehicle wasn't even there. I sat down to wait and wasn't very happy about it. A few minutes later, the person at the counter came over and told me since I was so rude, they were canceling my reservation. A couple I was sitting next to had been waiting for 2 hours and all 3 of us were totally shocked. I've never seen such poor customer service. Had I walked in from the street, it would be expected to have to wait. But, with a reservation, that is just unacceptable!"
286,1,"Last week I picked up a car from the Emerald Club Aisle with no discernable damage. 9 family members will also attest that there was no notable damage to this vehicle when I got it and when I took it back no incidents in-between. When I returned the car, the attendant went straight to the right front fender and noted a VERY SLIGHT misalignment of the bumper to the fender–nothing that one would notice upon casual inspection and barely discernable even when you get up close and look for it. She then crawled under the car and reported the entire airfoil missing. Manager immediately fills out a damage report against ME. I did no damage to this car. I had no way of knowing–sort of crawling under the thing at time of pickup–that I was getting a damaged rental car. And it appears I have no recourse to protect myself against being charged with this repair and turned over to collections if I don't pay. I've found several accounts of this nature online with National. And the unseen damage/ ""missing airfoil"" are noted as a common scams in CBS news articles, etc. on the internet. I am kicking myself for not getting the VIN and license number, taking pictures, etc. But in truth, what good would that do me unless I'm willing to pay thousands of dollars in legal fees to contest this. Rental car companies can hit consumers false, and possibly fraudulent claims based on their word against yours as to whether the damage was there before you picked up the vehicle. What recourse do I have? They put a damaged car out on the lot, whether by accident or intentionally and can claim any previous damage against me and/or any number of renters before or after me, bill me, turn me over to collections, defile my credit rating... and I can do nothing about it? I have no legal leg to stand on? They have the car in their possession. I live 3 states away and had a plane to catch so I couldn't adequately respond to the claim at the time or now."
287,1,"I purchase a car for $9,995.00 and they finished totaling up the cost., it was over 16,000 dollars. I was looking at the local news and found out they were supposed to sell the car for the price it was and not add any other prices on. And by the way this is a 2001 car. I never would have paid that amount of money for a 2001 car. I could have purchased a new car. This is so wrong for them to take advantage of hardworking people. Also false advertising. You end up putting down more."
288,2,"I wrote in before about this company and how they rip hardworking people off that don't have A1 credit. I recently decided to turn that car back in after that car put me and my family down again. That car stayed in and out of the shop more than I could make payments on the car. My family and I never got the chance to enjoy the car because the car was always in and out of their shop being worked on for the same thing. When the car first started giving me problems, I gave them the choice of giving me my money back and take the mess. Every month the car was in their shop being looked at. Then they were calling about their payments.
I'm disabled and needed the car to help me and my family get back back and forth to our doctor's appointments, to the store and make sure that my kids get to school. I was not trying to call around and ask for rides and pay for rides from family and friends when I had a car sitting right outside my home. I don't live on bus line and there isn't a bus stop anywhere near my home for about 6 miles one way and 8 the other way. Then waiting on someone to decide when they would have the time to take the car back and pick you up was something I wasn't trying to go through. I decided to give them their car back.
Now they have sold the car and telling me that I owe them $9,000 for what's left owed on the car. I don't feel like I should pay them back anything when I started having problems within the two weeks after paying them $3,500 down for something that I couldn't enjoy and something that was always in and out of their shop being fixed for the same thing."
289,1,"I purchased a vehicle from Pars Cars two months ago and I had to replace the power steering pump last week (July 13, 2012) which cost me $678.00. This car is a total lemon. The regulator in both windows on the passenger side needs to be replaced and that will cost an additional $700.00 to repair (that is for parts only, not including labor). There is a major leak with the oil pan which can only be fixed at the dealership. The salesman that sold me this car had the audacity to follow-up with me a month later to let me know that he was disappointed because I had not referred anyone to him. Are you serious? I would not be a true friend to anyone by referring them to Pars Cars, only to be sold a lemon! This is one of life's lessons I have to learn. However, I will be more selective in who I do business with in the future.
For those of you with challenged credit, do not purchase from Pars Cars! There are reputable car dealerships that will do business with you. You may not have your ""dream"" car but at least you will have ""dependable"" transportation that doesn't cost you huge repair bills every other month. I hope I've managed to save someone from this headache and deception. Do your research!"
290,1,"I bought a 2003 Nissan Murano on March 29, 2012 from Pars Car Sales on Mount Zion Blvd in Morrow and thought I was getting a really good deal on this car until they started adding up all this extra stuff. The car already had 117,000 miles on the car and my husband didn't like that at all, but we needed a car because we are both disabled. We started having problems with this car burning oil, rattling and not wanting to pick up speed going uphill in March and we called them about it. They told us to take it into their service department and have them look at it. That's what we did and all they did was top it off with oil. Then in May, we were there again twice for the same thing and again on June 29th. For the same thing, they did the same thing again and sent us on our way and told us that we would need to bring it back. But before we could do that, the car put us down not too long after we left there. We had to have the car towed into their service department over at Southlake and that is were the car is still. When we got the car, the car had a warranty on it for 90 days 3000 miles and we had 2000 more miles to go before the warranty was up. I think about 3 more days. We have been trying to reach someone over at the Mount Zion location since Friday and haven't gotten anything but the runaround and haven't been offered a rental car or anything. Mind you, my husband and myself are both disabled and have doctor appointments that we have to go to but no longer have a way to get to them because we don't have a way of getting there. They called today, July 5th, 12PM, telling me that the warranty has ran out and we will have to pay $3,100 to have the motor replaced in the car because that is the problem. I don't think that this is right when the car started messing up in April, not even a month of having the car. This company needs to be put out of business and not be able to sell any more cars."
291,1,"I only had $500.00, and I also had a 1999 Volkswagen Passat that I had to trade in because of the cost of maintenance for it. I don't know what I was thinking. I needed a reliable car, and I thought I could get one from them. I was there for 8 hours. I qualified for this 2003 Impala, in which they initially stated that the monthly payments would be $390.00 per month. I had enough sense to know that was ridiculous, and I talked them down to $315.00 after four hours.
After driving the car for about a month, it began to slip very often. I took the car to the Chevy Dealer for a diagnostic test, before my warranty ran out, and received paperwork stating that the transmission and the engine was bad. They told me that the car was no good. They looked at me in pity, as if they knew how crooked Pars Cars was. So I took the car back, and showed them the paperwork. Pars Cars stated that they couldn’t go by the paperwork and had to do their own diagnostic test and that it will cost me $95.00. So I had to pay them for the diagnostic test. How crazy is that? So I was just waiting for them to disagree with the Chevy Dealership’s diagnostic results, but they agreed that the engine and transmission was going bad. Maybe it was because I said if they don't give me another car, I will leave that car there. Not that another car would be any better.
So they said I qualified for a 2002 Honda Accord with 150,000 miles. The payment for this car was much higher, $350.00, and I had to spend four hours again talking them down to $315.00. One of the sales manager's spoke with such professional ""crooked persuasion"". He just kept saying, ""Oh you have a great car here""! I knew that I made a bad decision going to that place. After a couple of months, the Honda began slipping, the D4 light was blinking on and off, and the car was idling to 4-5k. I took the car to several places to get it fixed, replaced all the mounts, the head gasket, water pump, and other things that I have paperwork on. I went to Mr. Transmission in Riverdale, GA, and was advised that the transmission is bad. He said that it would cost about $1700 to repair the vehicle. This is money that I don't have. So they gave me another lemon! My interest rate is about 28%. I owe about $23,000 on the car and if I paid it off with cash, it would cost $12,000.
I didn't really know what I was getting into. I just knew that I needed a reliable car. There's nothing reliable about Pars Cars! So this car is going back! It's not worth the crazy headache, that it has been costing me. Now everybody tells me, ""I could've told you not to go there"". ""Everybody knows their crooked as hell""! I'm a single parent, with two kids, struggling enough. They do ** so slick, you don't even know what hits you, if you're not hipped to the game! I will never recommend anybody to go there ever. And if they try to throw paperwork at me to go to court, I have my paperwork too! And I will use the $$$$ that I save from taking this junk car back, to pay for an attorney! I know that we live and we learn. This place definitely helped to open my eyes. It’s sad what people will do for money."
292,1,"I purchased a used 2000 Ford Escort from Pars Cars in Morrow and the car did not last 6 months. The car had a bad engine. I paid full in cash for the car. The customer service I received was awful. I had to put the car in the shop twice, at Pars Cars dealership. The first time, I had to pay them $600. The 2nd time, they asked for an additional $2400. I refused to pay. The car is still sitting on their lot. Do not buy from this company!"
293,3,"I purchased a used vehicle from Pars Cars on 4/29/09. I was not aware of Georgia's lack of lemon laws until I heard it repeated to me several times after they took my money. But Pars Cars’ claim is that they will put credit challenged individuals in safe, reliable vehicles while you are making affordable payments while rebuilding your credit. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I sit here writing this complaint, I have spent $1,267.39 in repairs while still making $350.85 monthly payments. It started with the ABS light, then the ball joints, then fuel pan leaking, then the tire rods. Now, we are back to the ball joints again because they were not installed correctly by Pars Cars.
Due to the amount of money I had to be paying to repair the vehicle, I communicated with the credit department that my first couple payments would not be on time and was granted extensions; however, I was not aware that I was accessing late fees for those months. I went on to make my payments and was never told about the fees until September when United Auto Acceptance debited my account without my authorization for an amount that exceeded my payment amount. When I tried to use my debit card and it declined, I was notified that they had debited my account twice totaling over $900.00 and sent my account into overdraft because I had other charges pending in addition to a money order I had already purchased for the car payment.
I have been paying with money orders for the past few months. I notified Carol of UAA that I would be sending the payment on 12/7/09, and I did. On 12/9/09, I took the car in for the ball joints inspection, and after making the arrangements to do the repairs, and as I was getting ready to pick up the vehicle, I was advised by Ms. **, the Credit Manager, that the vehicle will not be released until the full payment is received. I offered to bring my portion of the money order as proof of payment, and she refused and claimed I owed $421.07 and that is what I would need to get the vehicle back today. I have been paying an average of over $300.00 for repairs on this vehicle every other month. The late fees are $70.16; that is nothing compared to $300.00.
When I expressed to her that I have no other means of transportation and I need the vehicle to go to work, her response (while eating) was she needs my account to be current for me to get the vehicle. When I questioned as to why I was charged late fees when UAA agreed to give me an extension, she became nasty and asked me what did I expect when I purchased such an old vehicle. She went on to emphasize the year and make of the vehicle. Doing business with Pars Cars/United Auto Acceptance has been a nightmare. I did not pick this vehicle. After they took my deposit, I was basically led to the vehicle and told that is what I was qualified for. Please help me."
294,1,"Newark, NJ - Rented a car from them several weeks ago now, purchased the EZ Pass thinking it would save me time and be worth the money. Had a charge several weeks later for the tolls. Okay no problem $50 plus dollars worth of tolls seemed a little much but okay I'll pay it. Then receive another fee of $60 plus dollars several days later with no explanation to what it could be. When I call Enterprise (can't get a hold of the exact location; how convenient). I talk with customer service they say they can't tell me what the fee is exactly for but it's a cleaning fee for the car. $60 plus dollars?! She asked if I smoked in the car? No I don't smoke. Did I have a pet? No was on vacation; didn't even eat in the car and yeah thought it was taken care of when they looked over the car with me. I mean they gave me a receipt that says no discrepancies... so she says she has to contact them and they will give me call to talk about it. It's been over a week and haven't heard anything? 2 days later I get another $20 dollar toll charge? As if $50 wasn't enough. Now I want a list of the tolls I went through; how much each cost. The details would be real helpful but you can't get a hold of them no matter how many messages you leave. Really great customer service too. They all act like well it wasn't them that made the charge. So funny enough started working with an ex-employee of Enterprise recently and they told me a lot about how sketchy they are and how much they're pushed to tack on as much fees as they can get away with. Honestly completely unsatisfied with this company's behaviour. It's absurd you share your private information with them and they think they can get away with adding themselves to some type of payroll without your consent. Super dodgy people that are inconsiderate about wasting your time. Probably just want you to give up trying to get these absurd charges back."
295,1,"Hello, I would like to leave negative stars if it would allow me too. I have been with Enterprise for the past 4 years and a platinum member all four years. Not only will I not ever use Enterprise again due to this location and the location at the Houston Bush location, but I will spread the word on the horrific experience I experienced and the negligence of Enterprise taking care of the situation. It's been over week since this incident happened and I can not even get a hold of the branch manager or district manager. Several messages and emails has been sent.
I had to use the Enterprise road service and needed my car towed. They told me that they could not tow it back to Hobby, and that I needed to get towed to Bush airport. I said that was fine. This was a 50 minute trip. But instead it turned to a three hour trip. I was first taken to Buckeyes for him to use the restroom. That was okay till we stopped to talked to another tow truck driver (not the same company) for 20 minutes and not using language you would use in from of a customer.
After getting on the road he tells me, ""Oh ** my tires are flat."" We just left a gas station that had air. I said, ""Okay what now."" He said we need to fill them up. After driving for 15 minutes we pull into a neighborhood. At this point in time I am very scared and nervous and tried to remain calm. He parks and goes into a house. I send my family my location and tell them the situation. I am not from Texas and this made my family nervous and I was not sure really what to do.
I literally froze. My tow truck driver then gets back into the truck after going into the house for a few minutes. He states all better. I said, ""The tires?"" He said yes. I did not want to cause him to get upset so I said, ""Please take me straight to the airport."" He said okay. I may not be the brightest when it comes to cars, but I know going into a house will not inflate tires. After driving for an hour and 20 minutes, we pull into another gas station and he looks at his phone and says,""Oh my god we have been going the wrong way."" I told him that I was very nervous and need to know if I need to get out and Uber. He said, ""No the airport is half an hour away."" We then get to the place that he needs to drop the car off and he leaves the car and finally drops me off on the ramp to get to the car rental.
I explained my situation to the employees at Bush, the attendant taking care of me apologized and said, ""Geeze I hope we get our car."" I said, ""Oh yea you got it. It's about 5 minutes from here."" He said, ""Wait he took you there too."" I said yes. Obviously he was not supposed to take me there either. The gentleman that was checking me into my car told his manager what happened and he did not seem to care at all how horrified I was. I told him, ""Look you can look at the GPS tracker in his truck and get all the locations and stops that we made."" I told him that you can see that the pick up is 50 minutes from here and not 3 hours.
The next day I told the branch assistant manager of Hobby and I was told that the manager would call me. After 2 days the manager did call me, left me a voicemail with a number that no one ever answers. I have emailed him asking him to please call me over a week ago. I have called the customer service line and have left a message for both the Branch manager and District manager to call me back and here we are a week later and nothing. They obviously do not care about their customers or the fact that they have experience a terrifying experience."
296,1,"This is a review of Enterprise Rental Car Company, specifically in Kirkland, Washington. I was tasked with a job of driving the shuttle bus I normally drive for work to a location in Kirkland, Washington to have a new paint job done for a rebranding of the location I drive the bus for. It was arranged in advance by my employer to have a rental car reserved so that I might get back to Bellingham, Washington to retrieve my car and get home. When I called the Enterprise location to get picked up, I was put on hold for a couple minutes, while on hold I listened to the recorded advertisement for the company, which repeated over and over, with the main theme being “we pick you up”…”relax and leave it all to us”.
When the agent came back on the line I explained who I was and that I was calling to get picked up, he then informed me that they don’t actually do that on Saturdays, as they are understaffed and too busy. I explained that my employer had arranged this rental car specifically because I would need to be picked up from the shop where the bus was to be painted. I also explained that I had no other form of transport to get to them to get the car. At that point the agent relented and said they would pick me up.
Once he had and had brought me back to their office, another agent “the manager” asked for my driver’s license which I provided to him. He entered it into the computer and then announced that I was on the “do not rent to list”, I asked what was he talking about and he said I had an outstanding balance with Enterprise from 2011 and that they would not be able to rent to me until that was paid. I had rented a vehicle in 2011 and had prepaid for the rental IN FULL. I never received any additional bill in the mail, never received a phone call, never had anything appear on my credit report, and was never contacted by collection of any kind. All of which I told him, and he said I would have to take that up with his corporate office which would be open on Monday (this was Saturday).
The actual rental was being procured by my employer who is a nationwide company and the billing information had been provided by my employer, I was only listed as the driver of the vehicle. This did not matter to these agents in this Kirkland office, they reiterated that I would have to pay my balance before they would “rent me the car”.
I was now stuck 90 miles from my home. Attempts were made to obtain another car from other rental car companies in the area, but there were none available. So while all of the options of transport for me to get home were being exhausted and subsequently another employee of the company had to drive down from Bellingham, 90 miles to pick me up and return to me my vehicle and home. This all took 6 hours, 3 of which I spent in the parking lot of Enterprise where I was told to move twice by the manager to smoke a cigarette, ending up across the parking lot, and the office closed while I waited in the parking lot, all without another word to me. I strongly advise anyone contemplating using Enterprise Car Rental to NOT. Find someone else to give your business to."
297,1,"I had a car rental because I was in an accident. After insurance paid for the first 30 days, the auto repair body shop and Enterprise, acting on my behalf but without my agreement, made an agreement for the auto body shop to pay for the additional car rental until my car was finished. When I got my car back in May 2017, I returned the rental. In Aug, 1 day apart, both the auto body shop and my bank acct was charged. Enterprise received payment twice for 1 account. After Enterprise admitted to owing me $600 out of $1740.96 and saying they would at least pay that back to me, they have not to this day refunded my money and I am going to small claims court to sue the company for my money."
298,3,"I called the Redmond Enterprise branch this morning on the 4th of August 2018, to confirm that they had availability. I was told they most had availability for various different vehicles that I was interested in. I then proceeded to book online and I made my booking for 2 pm on the same day of the 4th August 2018. When I arrived I was told that there were absolutely no cars available and I should just come back at 9 am the following day when there ""should"" be some cars available. Am I expecting too much, that if I make a booking on their website and even call first for confirmation, that a booking should not go through or be accepted if the car(s) is not available? Is that too much to ask? I really felt that the situation was treated with such a cavalier attitude. What if I had set plans that I could not break and I was relying on this vehicle to get somewhere by a certain date(s) and time(s)? Just shocking!"
299,1,"I didn't rent a car from Enterprise, my parked car was hit by an Enterprise Rent-A-Car driver who purchased supplemental insurance. I've been waiting three months and RIS, the rental insurance services company in Tempe, AZ, refuses to pay citing they don't have enough information--not sure it's covered and a host of other reasons. Story: My car was parked in a residential neighborhood in LA three months ago. This woman who rented a Toyota from Enterprise in Beverly Hills and purchased the supplemental insurance hit my parked car and another parked car on a Sunday @ 2:00 a.m. How do I know? There were police reports on his car and mine. My car was towed later in the morning to my mechanic. I called Enterprise, reported it. Submitted BOTH police reports, pictures of my car, tow truck bill and my mechanic's bill. According to Enterprise in Beverly Hills all is good because the driver purchased their supplemental insurance.
Enterprise's Liability rep. Jaclyn says not so fast. Not sure it's covered etc. I called the Insurance Commissioner of California. Enterprise is a private company--I can sue the driver in small claims, if I win (She said how could I not) Enterprise would have to pay my court fees and the claim. Meantime, I can't get this rep to talk to me and Enterprise is ignoring me. Because the damage is not enough, I can't get an attorney. Enterprise knows this which is why they're playing this game. I travel for work and will no longer use Enterprise for a car rental. If you HAVE to rent from Enterprise, use a credit card and say NO to any of the insurance options. The Salespeople make commission on selling it to you and there are NO guarantees you will be protected from purchasing it."
300,1,"When I rented from Enterprise I used a debit Visa Card and the website let me reserve the car. The website said you can use Debit/Visa if you show a Bank statement and some bill (Hydro) with your name on it. When I go in to pick-up the car I was told I couldn't use Debit/Visa, but they will allow it this time if I pay an extra $200 deposit from my card, which I will be reimbursed after I return the car. That should have been said on the website! That fact that they did this in the moment I was standing there in need of a car is slimy as! But I had no choice and of course they know this! So I put down the deposit. When I returned the Car I was then only then told that the deposit couldn't be reversed and a check would have to be mailed to me. I said that! In the year 2018 you can't reverse a charge, (that was a deposit not a charge) and your mailing a check!!! So almost 3 weeks later and no check!!! When I called Enterprise The typical idiot who didn't know what I was talking about! He says his supervisor isn't around and He will call me back. Never called me back!! Called again. Got the supervisor. His name is Jamie. He made this slimy deal in the first place. Here is Enterprise great customer service! This guy (Jamie) makes me feel like telling me they never should have rented to me in the first place! That they don't take Debit/Visa. So why the hell did you rent me the car! See this is a true sign of a Sociopath, make the other person feel even though you made all this happen! Jamie should be fired and charged with theft! Also this company gives you a car with half a tank of Gas! That is such a RIP OFF! Every customer is going to give the car back with more gas in it. You can't top off half a tank! This company needs to be looked into because they are clearly stealing from their customers!"
301,1,"Do not, I repeat do NOT subscribe! I’ve had the subscription for 3 months and I have gotten one box. The second month when I didn’t receive the box I contacted customer service and was told they would be sending me a replacement with tracking because the first tracking showed it was sent back to them for an error on their part. After a week I had not received the email with tracking so I contacted them again, this time I was told I would not be given tracking but the box should show up within 2 to 3 weeks.
It has now been over three weeks, a third month has come and been billed and I have yet to receive the last month's box or tracking for this month's box. I have contacted Customer Service again and requested a refund on last month's and this month's and cancellation of my service. I’ve read some of the reviews that said that they don’t necessarily cancel when they say they do so I’m prepared to contact my bank if need be. I’m filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau as well."
302,1,"I've been a subscriber for 5 months. For the last 4 of those 5 months, I've been charged for the box and weeks later have had to email to ask where the box is. Only then does my box ever get shipped. Today I decided to call instead of email. The first person I spoke to was very friendly and understood my frustration. He told me he saw in my account that my box has ""missed the truck"" literally every month. He transferred me to a supervisor to further assist me. That's where the problems really start. He left me with this HORRIBLE woman who was the nastiest customer service representative I've ever spoken to. She basically tried to tell me that it didn't miss the truck and it was leaving the warehouse today. I asked why I had to prompt my box to be shipped every month and she interrupted me (which she continued to do over the duration of the call) and told me it was not because of my promoting. I said I felt like that was a lie because it's happened every single month and the person I spoke to previously admitted my box kept missing the truck and he didn't know why. She then flipped out and wouldn't stop yelling at me about calling her a liar. I kept trying to say I was sorry for saying I felt like she was lying to which she continuously interrupted. I told her I was the customer and she probably shouldn't speak to me this way and she went off again saying I was the one who was being awful. I wasn't. But even if I was, I am the customer who clearly is frustrated because my money keeps being taken with no box showing up until I ask where it is. She then interrupted me and told me she was transferring my call. She didn't. She left me on hold for several minutes. I hung up and called back to cancel my account and request a refund. Do not become a subscriber. There are a million other beauty boxes that aren't littered with bad customer service and terrible warehouses."
303,2,"I am very disheartened by the fact that for the last three or so months my card has been charged at random times throughout the month, I do not receive products until late the next month when promised otherwise, and I have not received any assistance from customer service as they take too long to reply and only send copy and paste replies. I have had a particular issue with allure beauty box and after requesting they reimburse my account or cancel my membership, they went ahead and processed my debit card instead. This company is untrustworthy and even though I try to get reimburse or cancel, it seems to fail each and every time."
304,1,"I'm living in France and I offered a one year subscription to my sister in law who lives in Las Vegas in December 23, 2017. Allure Box has charged my bank account for the total amount of the subscription and I've received an order confirmation without any order number, since then (we are now mid January) I absolutely have no news about the shipment of any box although it is mentioned on their FAQ ""If you are a new subscriber, your box will ship no later than 10 days after sign up"". I wrote a complaint to BEAUTYBOX@ALLURE.COM on Jan 2nd and never got any response either. I call it robbery and now I'm about to contact my bank to oppose the payment as an fraud. I'm so unhappy I needed to share this very bad experience."
305,3,"I had a horrible experience with one of the girls in Mac in Flatiron Mall, Broomfield, CO in spite of buying $100 product because I just asked her to try the product before I buy. She not only refused in a rude manner but also said to me that she does not like me. I asked for her manager. She got one of the other girls in the store and they both said they are tired of helping the customers and they are done for the day while it was just 3:30 pm. I have been buying MAC products and I was treated this way, I went to buy eyelashes, but I didn't buy them and even today I have not bought because of this rude behavior. This should be escalated because such people should not be in customer facing environment."
306,3,"I do like the lipsticks (colors and somehow they wear) for the most part, seemingly allergic to something in their eyeshadow and only theirs? NOW, onto the brow pencils, the last two I used with nearly every stroke they would break off and no I don’t open it too far, I’ve taken photos of the size pieces that would break off. I sent them these photos along with a message on their Facebook page as the store I purchased from is 25 miles away. They responded to take them to the store for exchange (too far plus first one gone), and then gave me an address to customer or consumer care to write to which I did and NEVER heard back from them."
307,2,"I started out purchasing Mac as a permanent makeup solution for fashion, media, social outing, and professionalism. I went back the Carlsbad Mall and was approached by a saleswoman, demonstrating how to use the Mac makeup for under eyes. I did not agree with the saleswoman at the time and I said, ""No thank you, I just need a eye liner, over from there."" She guaranteed it will make my eye shine but I said, ""My pupils are shiny enough."" She responded, ""Your eye's like around your eyebrows, but all around the eyes."" I responded, ""No thank you, I just need liner."" She replied, ""Like the one in your hand."" I said, ""I'm going to pay for it as soon as I make it to the counter."" The saleswoman says, ""My station, right here"" and I replied ""Before the checkout stand?"" The saleswoman replied, ""Yes."" I replied, ""I only need this eyeliner"" and she says, ""Is it liquid, is liquid eyeliner."" I said, ""No, just eyeliner, something I can put on."" The saleswoman jumped in my face and I went forward and landed near her work chair but was not sitting. The saleswoman say, ""You're already over here, just allow me to put this, do your eyebrow, eyeliner."" I said, ""I don't think I would like it."" I tried to make it to the checkout counter, and the saleswoman notice me trying to leave and said, ""Just let put, what color do you prefer,"" and notice the black eyeliner in my hand. By then the lady at the checkout had left and returned and walk to me to say, ""Just let her put on the makeup."" I said ""It is eyeliner. You're on your own."" The saleswoman asked the checkout lady, ""Do you prefer liquid or the old eyeliner pencil?"" The checkout lady say, ""Liquid. I have it now."" The saleswoman says, ""That is what I am trying to explain, the pencil is old news, liquid is what is in."" I said, ""I rather keep the old pencil."" The saleswoman says, ""Why?"" I said, ""How long does it take to dry?"" She says, ""You can't answer a question with a question. Just sit back and let me."" She then attempted to grab her makeup gear and I sprinted the checkout stand and left the eyeliner and the mall."
308,1,"I got a cosmetic kit from MAC in January 2017. When I got the kit I realized that both lipsticks included are dried out and low quality. I sent them back (paid ~$15 for shipping) and asked for refund or replacement, as they said they would do if the customer was unhappy and sent back the product, but nothing has happened after more than 3 months of sending them back their product. Not even an email of explanation! I am so unhappy! Don't buy from them! I need to add that I also got some other products that I liked, but this one was more pronounced to me, so I would give 0 stars if I could!"
309,1,"October, 2012. Was told I would receive a sedative before procedure. A prescription for  was given to me. Seated in the room before the procedure I asked the technician what other type of sedative I would receive and she told me the was all I would need as most people are very groggy when they come in. I was totally awake and the doctor was surprised but continued to inject my face. I was to return the following day to have bandages removed. They scrubbed my face raw. The sutures behind my ears eventually started to come out and to this day, June 2017, this area is totally numb. I also had my eyelids lifted - Which turned out uneven. Paid $10,000 and had to sign a waiver stating I would not sue if there were any unforeseen problems. Worst decision I ever made."
310,2,"I had this Lifestyle facelift in San Antonio Texas by a very disreputable doctor. I have since found out I was supposed to have it started at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Did not start until 7:30 that night. I was told it would take an hour and a half. The surgery was completed at 11:30 that night. After much pain the next day the stitches fell out.
I went back in to have stitches put it back in and was yelled at about the doctor that my blood pressure has gone outrageously high. So that was my fault instead of his for whatever drugs he was giving me. I have resulted in having severe face pain and numbness on above my ears all the way down around my jaw, up to the other side of my temple as having no feeling whatsoever except the horrible tingling so it is painful all of the time. If there is a class action lawsuit against this Lifestyle facelift I would love to be a part of it. Please let me know."
311,1,"Without a doubt the worse decision I have ever made. I had watched the infomercial on this procedure over and over and it sounded so good, I finally made the call and set up an appointment for my consultation. Everything seemed fine and I felt good about the procedure. On the morning of my procedure I was very calm and relaxed, not scared at all. Even the nurse who took my vitals made a comment on how calm I was. I was given 20 mg of and put in a room to relax. When I was good and sleepy they came in to start the procedure. Well there is no stimulus like pain. I chose to have the fat pockets removed from under my eyes. It felt like pure fire in my eyes. I could not be still and my surgeon became very upset with me. When my blood pressure shot up they gave me 10 mg more of and went to the lobby and told my husband they were having a little problem with my blood pressure. When the procedure was finally over, they wheeled me to my car and sent me home with 30 mg of in my system. Look up, 2 mg is a huge dose. It was late when we got home and my husband put me on the couch and went to bed. Several times during the night I know I stopped breathing, something would tell me breath, and I would struggle for a deep gulp of air and then fall right back to sleep. The next morning I could not even see. Procedure was advertised as down time 2 weeks. Well, 2 weeks after my procedure I looked like I had been beaten. My face went from blue to purple to yellow to green to brown. I was swollen and bruised for months. My face did not even feel real. My ear lobes are forever changed and cannot wear hoop earrings anymore, because they stand straight out. This was the most painful experience I have ever encountered and the most misleading. 8000.00 to be tortured. Would never let anyone touch me again unless I was under general anesthesia and the procedure was done in a hospital. Everyone who fell for this scam should be reimbursed what they paid plus pain a suffering."
312,1,"I had Lifestyle Lift surgery in Dallas office on 2006 at a cost of $4500. They did some lipo and lifted my chin-somewhat. The results were minimal and lasted only a few months. The trade-off? They DISFIGURED my ears. I have no lobe and where there was a lobe it is now attached to my face. For years there was considerable scarring in front of and behind my ears. Thankfully the scarring diminished about 5 years after the surgery. My temples had a lump on each side where it appears they bunched up skin. It took years for the lump on my right temple to diminish to the point of nearly invisible but the lump on left side of my face is still there. For years I have also had a lump in front of my ears. It is more pronounced on one ear than the other. It appears that is were they gathered skin and just sewed it up.
I never went back to ""fix issues"" because clearly they have proven their incompetence the first time around so why would I risk further disfigurement? After seeing numerous disaster plastic surgeries from Lifestyle Lift and other surgeons around the country to include those that do surgery on celebrities which are known to pay millions, I have come to the conclusion that 90% of plastic surgeons are incompetent and only in it for the money. They couldn't care less if they disfigure someone. In spite of it all, I consider myself one of the lucky ones. My disfigurement is nowhere near as bad as others I have seen online compliments of Lifestyle Lift.
My belief now is that facial/chin plastic surgery should only be done on someone whose face is already disfigured as a result of accident or illness and surgery is done to eliminate or alleviate that disfigurement not for the purposes of eliminating wrinkles or sagging skin. There are better, safer non-invasive procedures these days that can eliminate or reduce wrinkles and sagging skin in face and neck. If I could go back in time I would have NEVER EVER done this procedure. Ever since this surgery I have little faith in Doctors in general and avoid them like the plague. I do my research and look for alternatives if I have to have a procedure done. Please please please do not do this! The amount of ""successes"" are small compared to the failure rate. And yes they will disfigure your ears (pixie ears and more) in order to what they consider successfully complete the surgery."
313,2,"On May 9, 2012 I had a neck and lower eye lift done in Syracuse, NY for $9000.00. My initial follow-up appointment went well but I did not see the doctor who performed my surgery. My next follow-up appointment on May 21, 2012 I was not seen by the doctor. On November 12, 2012, I returned to the clinic to report my disappointment with the outcome of the neck lift procedure and was told by the nurse no doctor again, that yes there was a problem, the results of the procedure were not what they told me they would be and they would correct the problem at a reduced cost.
At that time they scheduled me for a return appointment which they later cancelled. I tried many times to contact the office to reschedule an appointment and I was always put on hold and could never get through to talk with anyone in the office. I am disappointed and dissatisfied with the outcome of my neck lift and even though I attempted to have my situation corrected I was never able to do so. Please contact me if there is a class action lawsuit. I would like to be included."
314,1,"Went in for Lifestyle Lift and resurfacing on total face in 2012, my face was so tight it was hard to smile and I had a lot of spots on my face (forehead, chin and upper lip) that had oozing scappy spots. After healing, my face had deeper lines and scars, my face fell drooping and neck was very loose and I can still feel pulling from my ears down the side of my face with expressions and eating when doing this the skin puckers up. I look older than before. I have a huge scar under chin and behind my ears looks chewed up. I had problems healing under chin and ears, I had bleeding and oozing behind my ears for about a month after stitches were removed.
After calling their office I was told someone would get back to me, no one did. After repeated tries to call and phone just rang with no answers or the same runaround and excuses, I gave up. I managed to keep the areas clean with otc products till completely healed. I did go to a clinic and I was told they wouldn't help me because it was cosmetic and I needed to go back to the dr. that performed the surgery - as I said I was given the runaround. This was very painful and now I can't wear my hair up because of the horrible scars and have to deal with this pulling when I make any facial expression or chew and the scars from the resurfacing and incisions. This company hurt and ripped off a lot of people!"
315,2,"I was reading some of the reviews, and happen to agree that they have changed the formula of some things. I noticed, that the loose powder that I have bought for years, does not feel, or look the same. Plus, I agree with not just Clinique people who like to tell you the color they like. All department store cosmetic people don't know what they are doing. I cannot say how many bottles of foundation that I have thrown away. So, I am looking for another loose powder. Serves you companies right, when you start changing the formulas, and think people won't notice."
316,1,"Bait and switch marketing on the free gifts... So I’m sitting there at work and I get an email if I spent $28 I’ll get this free gift set. I didn’t need any makeup at the time but my concealer was running low so I thought I’d buy that and find something else to get this free gift set as it looks so darn cute. I clicked the link I had my choice between 2 gift sets- I chose the one I wanted. I then bought $28.83 worth of items which did qualify me for the free gift. But the free gift never came.
When I contacted customer care they said I already had a 15% off discount so I couldn’t get the seven piece set. That went on for three or four emails. Then I finally get somebody higher than that he says I only spent $27. I mean it’s right there on my bank account what I paid. I had free shipping. This is NOT a case where I just got something wrong. By the way this is the second time this is happened to me with Clinique. The makeup isn’t that great. Armani does a much better job with foundation. It cost a little bit more but you’ve got to try it. Anyway this company wouldn’t honor the seven piece free gift set with me and I wanted to share that with everybody so don’t be surprised if it happens to you because I went on their Facebook and it’s happening to a lot of people."
317,3,I have worn Happy for 20 plus years and I believe that Clinique has changed the formula. The perfume has a similar yet different scent than what I'm used to. It smells just like a knock off brand I bought mistakenly overseas in Dubai. The scent also use to last all day and by the end of my day the scent is gone. This is horrible considering the price of this perfume is much more expensive than before. If you are going to make shortcuts to a product then you need to be fair to your consumers and decrease the price rather than increase it. BAD BUSINESS CLINIQUE! Would appreciate you going back to the old formula as this is my favorite and meshes well with my body chemistry.
318,3,"Clinique products is all I ever use and although I'm very happy with the wide range of make-up, perfumes, and cleansers I use from Clinique. I am very disappointed in the level of customer service. I placed an online order for a few items although my delivery seems to be missing 1 item. I have emailed 9 times. I have phoned only to be on hold for 20 minutes to be disconnected before actually speaking to anyone. I've also tried online chat only to be told nothing she can do. Email or phone customer service. You would think for the size of this company and the price they charge they would actually care about customer service."
319,2,"I purchased Clinique foundation and loved the natural look and feel of the makeup. However, though this product is listed as hypo-allergenic, it is the ONLY makeup that has ever dried out my skin and given me a rash. I do not have sensitive skin at all and I never have dry, flaky, or rashly skin. There must be something in this product which is unhealthy and even toxic to the skin. I came on here looking to find out what that could be... Apparently there are many other bad reactions in the customer base too. I don't know how a company could hope to remain in business like this. I did notice that there were no Clinique counters in most department stores anymore, and in the one who did sell it, the Clinique counter was all the way in the back and poorly attended."
320,3,I bought this product a week ago. I used to use Youth Surge SPF 15 with no comments. It was perfect. Then the lady who is responsible to sell this product convince me to go for this product. I put it on my face every day. On the third day I start having irritation on my chin. Then later on fourth day my chin looks very dry (It looks I did not use my cream. Very dry). I keep use it then I suddenly on the sixth day I have a swelling around my eyes and the skin dry. I do not know what to do. Help.
321,2,I joined Younique 06/16/18. For one make sure you get a good sponsor!! Yes my sponsor was Brook. She wrote something on my group page to make me look bad! So I ask her if she needed to say something! Send it to me in a message. So I didn’t respond to her rude message so the next morning she blows my messages up. So I got off Younique because of her. Then I wanted to join another girl that I should of join in the first place and Younique wants another 99.00 to get a new sponsor. That’s not fair at all.
322,3,"I began using Younique back in early 2016 after a friend began selling it. At first I loved it. Or at least I thought I did. I was using cheap drugstore makeup before that. Of course this was better. My regular items were the primer, liquid foundation, powder foundation and blush. I also got into using the mascara, eyeliner, lip stains, face wash and eyeshadows. By Jan 2018, I had tried every product they offer. I even was a seller for a few months. Now the bad part. In mid 2017, my skin began changing for the worst. I was getting cystic acne all over my face. I never had acne growing up so this was a shock. My face continued to get worse as the months went on but I refused to believe it was my makeup causing it since I had been using it for so long without any issues."
323,3,"I purchase products on October 1st 2017 was charged several time different amounts. Finally my Credit card company called and stopped more charges from coming through at this time I am already charged 1250.00 over my purchase. Call the person I purchased through she calls her person said, ""Oh no worries, we will get this corrected and make it right."" Needless to say today almost 2 months later still do not have all my money back and never received anything, E-mail nothing for an apology. When I called the company they said the rep did it and I should press charges. The gal I spoke with literally told me I should watch who I give my credit card info to. They don't even back the people that sell the products. Really did not feel as if they cared there was a mistake and they did not even help at all. Totally disappointed in the company."
324,1,"Very disappointed. My presenter told me that the makeup was hypoallergenic. So I order one item. After I got it and used it for one day, I broke out in severe hives. My husband had to rush me to the hospital. They had to give me shots, etc. I had a severe allergic reaction. When she came back over to get an order again, I explained to her what happened. She laughed and said hypoallergenic makeup don't do that and she insisted that I had to order. I told her no I wasn't ordering again.
She actually put in an order without my consent and had them ship her the order. She came by a little over a week later with $100+ worth of products and told me that it was my order. When I told her I never placed any order with her she got irritated and demanded money for this order. I never asked for or even knew what it was! My husband came to the door and told her to leave. Or he was going to call the police. She got a lawyer and tried suing me for this bogus order. Needless to say she didn't get what she wanted. I just hope she doesn't try to scam someone else."
325,3,"I purchased the product from a presenter. Purchased it based on the good experience this representative relayed to me. The day creme is ok, but for the price, I don't see the value. I purchased an eyebrow gel and it was empty. I called customer service and they asked me to prove it was empty by sending pictures. I asked them how I was supposed to send them a picture of a non-existent product. They asked me to wipe the wand on my hand and take a picture. I did just that and sent the picture. They sent me back an e-mail saying that they could not see anything, and I responded that was because the tube was empty. After several e-mails and calls, and two weeks later, I still have not received a replacement or refund. Today they sent me an e-mail asking for the lot number."
326,3,"After 6 1/2 weeks of waiting for my 'in stock' items, I finally received everything. This after multiple calls to the manager and district manager. Their records would show an item in but when it came time to schedule delivery, delivery couldn't find it or some story. They would say they will find out what's going on and call me back. That NEVER happened! On March 6, I spoke to Manager, in person because of new oven has a factory flaw in the front. He said he would call service and get back with me. That was 11 days ago! During that time, I realized the oven was not getting to the temperate the display indicated. The upper oven was running about 100 degrees cold. The lower oven about 75 degrees cold. Neither oven can maintain the temperature and takes forever to heat up again if you open the door.
March 10 rolls around and I had not been contacted about a service call or update on what was to be done. I called store and spoke, Assistant Manager, he said he just spoke and they are working on it and will call me back. Ok, that didn't happen, again. On March 14, I called the sales associate who sold me the oven and told him what was going on. He said his service guy just happened to be there and he would talk with him and call me right back. Guess what? No return call. I can't use my $2000 oven properly. They never give an answer to any question. Their reply is ""I'll look into it and call you back"". But they won't call you back. March 16, I called, District Manager. He said he will look into and call me back. That was almost laughable. And the 30 day money back guarantee? Useless if they won't return your call!"
327,2,"My husband and I went to the Clarksville, TN store to purchase several appliances that we had seen advertised. We were treated as thieves. They locked the exit door on us, the other couple behind us they let out. This is my list of what I was going to purchase: 2 sets of front load washer/dryers, 2 stainless French door refrigerators, 1 induction counter top range, 1 free standing range, 3 stainless front, stainless tub dishwashers, 1 small bar refrigerator, 60"" + UHD TV Surround sound. I will never, no matter what they advertise, will I go into their stores."
328,2,"I spent over $5000.00 for a 65"" Samsung 4k Curve TV and components (including Movie Pack). I let them know within a week that I was having problems with the TV turning off and the Movie Pack does not and has not worked (the delivery men did not test this before leaving). I spent money on an internet booster hoping that would resolve the problem - it did not. I have made 3 calls to the store I bought it from, each time having to explain from beginning because no one was familiar - every time someone, including the assistant manager, promised to find a solution and call me back. I bought this TV before Thanksgiving and it is now 1/8/2015, and no one has called me. I called home office this morning and they said they will have a district manager call me. Terrible service - once they have the money, it's over as far as they are concerned."
329,3,"October 30, 2014, we purchased a BRAND NEW refrigerator and scheduled delivery for November 1, 2014 in our new home. When the two men installed the refrigerator, one damaged the freezer door with a 6-inch dent. I'm not talking a small dent, but a significantly large dent. The delivery guy was so proud he admitted to us HE had dented the door! He was also very apologetic. He made note on the delivery paperwork the freezer door was damaged. He explained he would turn in the paperwork to the repair guy and a new door cover would be ordered immediately. Two weeks goes by and no response. My husband calls the store Manager who 'puts in a request.' One week later, my husband calls back and the store Manager gives my husband number to call directly. Are you serious??? My husband must call?
No return phone call, no follow-up from the store manager. The week after Thanksgiving, we stop by the store face to face and talk, who says the request has been put in place and asks us to take a picture of the 6 inch dent and the tag on the inside of the refrigerator and email it to him. My husband emails the pictures the very next day. My husband has to follow-up with the following day to confirm receipt. TWO WEEKS go by and not a word. I decide to stop by the store in person. Calls his District Manager and tells me 'he is just the middle man. Then gives me the number to the home office for explaining is very busy right now. Are you really serious? I call the home office and get a ""general mailbox."" More than 6 weeks and not a single response initiated by Electronics Express."
330,1,Will never shop here again. The sales people are so rude and will lie just to get a sale. They sold us a refurbished computer. I bought extended warranty. Doesn't matter. They just keep bringing you a used computer. Our computer has never worked. It would have been one thing if I knew I was buying a refurbished computer... But I didn't. They pulled a fast one over on me. And then they treat you like when you get mad and go back and complain. Please please don't buy from this place.... They have been doing this for years.... read other reviews.
331,2,"A dishwasher purchased from Electronic Express was installed by one of their workmen. This individual appeared to be in a rush, failed to secure the drainage hose, gouged two pieces out of the edge of the counter and, while dragging the old dishwasher out, left a scratch across five kitchen floor tiles and two in the hallway. I notified the store. A representative came to my home, took photographs and assured me that everything would be taken care of. After failing to hear from them, I sent an e-mail, visited the store, made a number of calls, always finding the manager ""not in"".
Eventually, I lodged a complaint with the BBB. Nothing was achieved. Sometime after this unfortunate series of incidents, I purchased a disposal at Lowe's. Their very competent installer also properly attached the dangling dishwasher hose and repositioned the dishwasher, which had not been properly positioned. I filled in the counter damage. Unfortunately, the floor tiles are still damaged. An extremely dissatisfied ex-customer."
332,2,"How to get started with what happened to me at Electronic Express. I went to look at buying a new laptop comp. I was looking at several laptops on sale but I finally found the one I wanted. So the salesman came over to help me and I told him I wanted this one, so he goes back to get the one I picked. I notice the one he brought out was opened. He takes it up to the front desk and he looks to see if it has been opened and he and the manager both said ""no it has not been opened."" So I told them both I wanted to look at it and I notice it has been opened.
From there the manager spoke up and said it has been opened and he had been used because the manager said an employee had bought it but lost their job and they brought it back. So they tried to sell me a new comp at a new price. Now that was really a bad thing to do and I bought one anyways but it is going to take almost 3 weeks to get one and I'm not happy in any way, and more than likely won't buy nothing else from this company again."
333,1,"We bought a Samsung 46 inch 3d Smart TV... or so we were told. We bought this on December 31, 2011 for my 50th birthday. We were very happy with the great picture and features. At the time we purchased it from Richard our salesman, he went over all the 3d features with us. We looked through the glasses as he explained how great 3d is. That was a big selling point to us. After we had it a while, we could finally afford to buy blu-ray 3d player, 3d glasses, 3d HDMI chord, & movies totaling around $400. Then we went home & hooked everything up. It wouldn't play! After a while we decided to contact Samsung for their assistance. They had us on hold forever only to come back & inform us that 4600 series was not a 3d TV. We had to have at least a 4700 series or higher. That was news to us!
So we went back to Cleveland store where we purchased it & spoke to Richard. We informed him of our problem & he told us he thought it was a 3d TV as well. We both discussed how it said 3d on the box at time of purchase. He said he was very sorry & that we should speak to Chris the manager. Chris looked at computer with our info & told us sorry, too much time had passed. The only thing he could do is maybe discount $50 off a new 3d TV. At this time, he informed us there is no profit in TVs anymore with the competition out there. But if we wanted to contact the regional manager, Dwayne, maybe he could do something. At this point we felt everyone was passing the ball.
So we called the regional manager Dwayne. He was very short with us. He almost acted like we were a thorn in his foot. He ALSO said there was nothing HE could do about the ""misunderstanding"" and too much time had passed. We really wondered how these 2 managers got in the positions they have with their lack of people skills. All they said they were willing to do was give us a discount buying a NEW TV! Their attitude was that everyone has the money around to spend $900 just to fix the problem. We had saved a long time for that TV, then saved another year to buy the 3d equipment and we don't have the money to just run out & buy a new one!
I recommend to all of you before you buy a TV from Electronics Express to have them plug in the exact TV or item you plan on purchasing. Don't go buy what the box says or salesman tell you. CERTAINLY don't expect them to make any thing right that was done wrong to you. It seems like Electronics Express has some bad business policies, so I guess all I can do is say SHAME ON YOU ELECTRONICS EXPRESS!!! If you keep doing your customers this way you will end up just like Circuit City!
P.S. We planned on spending a LOT more money in your store. We also had referred PLENTY of people to you but we no longer will!"
334,3,"I recently visited the Electronic Express of Tullahoma prepared to buy a television. Coming through the door was a surprise to me, making it very obvious these salesmen work commission. Here is a very unprofessional and very aggravating young man by the name of Bryce who greeted me. I asked questions of my own to try to get answers which television I should purchase. But for his own selfish and greedy reasons, he's trying his hardest to lean me towards the most expensive.
Unfortunately, this salesman didn't have any idea that I recently retired from the electronic field so I knew most of the info he was giving me was false! Be careful of this clown when you see him and guard your wallets. Coming back a few weeks later hoping another salesperson who knew their product would assist me, I run into the salesperson who by the name of Kenny sold my neighbor's their 65"" Samsung. This guy was amazing at his job and has done great with juggling me and two other customers getting me out the door a satisfied customer."
335,1,"My husband-to-be and I were looking for a docking station for my iPod for our wedding. We had been to various stores and had finally decided on a Bose SoundDock Series II. It was the perfect size and price for our needs. I had seen the SoundDock II at Best Buy for $199.99 and had found the same price on Bose's website. We decided to check to see if Electronic Express at the 100 Oaks Mall in Nashville had it in stock, since the HH Gregg next door did not. Electronic Express did indeed have it in stock, but they were charging $249.99 for it! That's $50 more than the Bose website was listing it!
When we asked if they could price match, and showed them the $199.99 price on the actual Bose website, the manager told us no. That's absolutely ridiculous in my opinion and a lesson well-learned. Be careful what you buy from them. They increase the price for no good reason and rip people off. If they can't price match from the manufacturer's own website, something's definitely wrong with the way they do business. I don't understand how they are still in business, given today's technology. People can just check for lower prices elsewhere at the touch of a button on their phones.
There was a happy ending. We promptly left that store, announcing loudly that we were going to the Bose store at the Opry Mills Mall. When we arrived, we found the SoundDock Series II priced at $199.99, as advertised online. However, there was even a better deal to be found! They had a factory-renewed SoundDock II for only $179.95 plus an extra 10% off! It even comes with a one-year warranty, something Electronic Express wouldn't offer (or if they did, they'd surely charge you for it). It is the perfect system, with clear sound but enough volume to fill the tiny banquet hall for our wedding. We are very pleased with the sales associates at Bose - they were very polite and obviously knew their product.
Long story short, do not buy from Electronic Express! They will overcharge you. If you are looking for a Bose system, go to the actual Bose store. And do your research before shopping. Know which prices are the lowest and where. Don't let Electronic Express bully you into buying a product you know you can buy cheaper elsewhere."
336,2,"At the Tullahoma store, an employee by the name of Jeremy installed my high-powered amp on top of my gas tank in a 1996 Mercury Grand Marquis. Four screws were screwed into the tank to hold the amp in place. While driving, my 10 year old daughter got sick from the fumes that were coming into my vehicle. Even with the windows down, my child still got sick. Anyway, they are fixing my car by paying the cost of a new gas tank; yet still, there is no excuse for a so called professional car audio installer to make a dangerous mistake like that. My lawyer wants me to pursue further actions by adding my child’s medical bill from inhaling gas fumes to the list, as well as missing important meetings that I’ve had to attend which resulted in lost wages. But I just want my car fixed. I will never deal with Electronic Express again!"
337,3,"We made a special trip to your Murfreesboro location. We were prepared to purchase the Asus Eee Pad Transformer you had advertised for Sunday's sale at $399.88. Your ad says it includes the keyboard dock. When we arrived and asked about this item, we were immediately told that the ad was a mistake. We were told that the California office that does your advertising had made an error with the ad and the keyboard dock is not included. It can be ordered for an additional $179 because you don't carry it. This is false advertising at its best. What a waste of time! Office Depot was selling the same item for the same price, and the keyboard dock was cheaper. What was so special about this sale? We are extremely disappointed on how this was handled."
338,1,I don’t know what kind of business you all are running but in the electronic express of Madison TN there is nothing but a bunch of druggies! I was walking into the store and I could see 3 men smoking in a car. The were all wearing the blue shirts with ties and they were parked on the side of the building. I thought that maybe it was just tobacco until I enter the store and started speaking with another male who worked there his eyes were blood shot and he was completely out of it. I couldn’t believe this! I will never come back and I will tell everyone including the better business Bureo. I hope the owner of the store will give a random drug test and get these low lives out of his store. This is ridiculous!
339,1,"My experience buying at ABT was one time a good experience. Five years ago maybe. It’s 2018 now. They sold me a Whirlpool fridge in 2015 that has not worked since it was delivered. Service visits tell us the doors can’t be adjusted to close properly and the fridge cannot be leveled? That’s their answer. Now because to cool properly there’s a chance of a fire because to run properly it has to be set to the highest setting causing it to run red hot literally glowing red hot coils. We have a 40 degree fridge rising 2 3 maybe 4 degrees opening the doors.
Service? 2nd attempt today 8/2/18. The first appointment for service they call at 8AM and give me a 5 to 7 PM visit. Now today 2nd time they call at 8 and give me 4 to 6 PM visit. Who wants a repairman emptying their fridge at 5 in the evening. This is unacceptable. They have shown a decline in quality as they continue to get worse and worse is their disregard for customer needs.
I will never set foot in ABT again. They were an excellent company; now as of 8/2/18 taken over by non caring liars. Once they have the cash we are on our own. We have to buy another’s fridge or risk sickness from an under performing fridge. Sales told us it was a good product. I hope this helps you check around to other appliance stores before trusting a name not a business that used to be good living on their name."
340,1,"I wish I would have read these reviews before ordering a refrigerator and dishwasher from ABT Electronics because it took 4 1/2 months to get my brand-new Whirlpool Refrigerator working properly to where it didn't freeze everything that wasn't in a drawer. We threw out so much food and so MANY dozens of eggs it's ridiculous. Their service department stinks. They have grown too large to be able to keep happy customers and that was the ONLY reason I chose them. Five service calls and five replacement parts it took. Many promises to call me back and I'm still waiting for the service manager to call me back.
I truly believe if I didn't call back so many times I would not have a working refrigerator. The worst part is I didn't get any apologies, not even a gift card for the food I threw out. I had to send them videos and pictures to get them to believe me. On one service call they sent someone simply to take pictures of frozen food, even though I had already done it. I felt like they thought I was give them bull because I had stated I wanted a different fridge. I would never go back to them again. It's like rolling the dice if you will get a service guy that knows anything also."
341,1,"NEVER BUY FROM THEM!!! There you have been forewarned now. I had an awful experience with buying a 65” tv from them online. They told me I’d have the TV in 5-7 business days but then the way they ship these units it actually is double the time. Even after speaking with Abt customer service and after an hour having them cancel the order and NOT charge me a restocking fee (this should tell us they don’t care about customer service charging folks for items that haven't even shipped just to get $$ from you).
After all of this was worked out with Abt to return. I get a phone call and an email from Randy Abt GM telling me he did me a favor and didn’t cancel because he could guarantee the delivery date I was expecting. He assured me over and over again it would happen. Of course it didn’t as a few days later I was told It was delayed, wouldn’t make the delivery date and I had to start all over again with cancelling the order and now paying out of pocket to the TV installation service for cancelling twice. Go anywhere but here! Everyone sells TVs and you can get them in a few days. Don’t buy their excuse of using specialized shipping methods and carriers that takes 2 weeks from IL to NJ. They make guarantees they can’t deliver on and no pun intended here."
342,2,"We are going on our 5th day of dealing with Abt and it has been an AWFUL experience. We purchased a Fisher & Paykel cooktop from Abt. During installation they cracked our 2"" Granite countertop in three places AND the cooktop they installed was broken and leaking gas. When we called Abt to tell them about the issues they said they could send someone out in a couple of days. Not only was there a gas leak, but they damaged our counters and didn't even provide a working cooktop.
We are going on our 5th visit from Abt, 2nd visit-senior tech sent to ensure the stove was actually leaking gas, 3rd visit-tech to take away the broken cooktop, 4th visit -granite guys sent to fix the granite which will never be the same and the damage can be seen-the guys that fixed the granite were great but it’s broken granite so will never be perfect again, and 5th visit they delivered a new stove...and it is DAMAGED. They have done nothing to compensate us for our time or the permanent damage to our countertops or the inconvenience of taking FIVE days off work. This is the worst experience I have ever had."
343,1,"I bought a pair of speakers through Amazon. They sold the pair and Amazon was to fulfill the order. This was for a PAIR of speakers for $499. I checked the tracking and noticed they only sent one speaker, while in transit. I called them and they said the description was wrong (they blamed Amazon) and they will call UPS and have the one speaker returned to them. It was their mistake on the website, I saw it and wanted to purchase the PAIR. Needless to say after I called Abt, they deleted their part of the fulfillment to look like they weren't there. EXTREMELY DECEITFUL!! Just because they messed up on the price, they should honor it! If you found something in a store that was marked wrong, the store always honors the price. Too bad Abt does not care for customers. All they care about is the sale and how much profit they can put in their pockets. NEVER AGAIN will I deal with these clowns. STAY AWAY FROM THEM!"
344,2,"I had not ordered from them in quite some time everything seemed fine until it came time to track down the delivery (which brought back the memory of why I had not ordered in so long). I was told a date of 11/30 when I first checked in online with pilot tracking I could see there was a problem. The TV was coming from IL to NY but it indicated it had departed from IL and arrived in NY but then showed it was back in IL. I called and was told that the information online was wrong but I would still get it on 11/30.
I had to call again when nothing was delivered on 11/30. I was then told they had to look and get back to me they did and said now it would be Monday 12/4. I called on 12/1 to confirm since no change had been made to the online status. I was confronted for calling again by the person in customer service at ABT she made as if it were fun to make multiple phone calls for a single delivery. I apologized and said goodbye. Not worth the hassle back to Amazon."
345,3,"I scheduled service on my clothes dryer. The morning of service the tech called and asked the brand and type of clothes dryer so that he could put parts in his truck. I said I did not know but I would call home and find out the brand and type of dryer. I then asked if he would call back? He said yes. He never called back. He came to my house at the end of the day in a big big rush and spent 5 minutes (only putting his hand on top of the dryer) and determined that my vent needed cleaning. I said, ""Great. Do you have a ladder"" and he said, ""Oh that's another department"". I don't understand this, I called service (which turned out to be $166 dollars for a 5 minute call) for a simple fix but he doesn't clean the vent? Abt needs to call in a specialist to clean the vent? Is vent cleaning brain surgery? I asked if the call applies to vent cleaning and tech said that it did not.
The morning of service he called to say that he was going to put parts for my dryer on the truck but after saying that he'd call back he didn't take 60 seconds to call back. This leads me to believe that I was set up for a second call long before the tech arrived. The vent cleaning is $189 and so I called to complain. They gave me a $33 credit. This token gesture isn't good enough. Maybe Abt is forgetting that half the reason people shop at Abt is service. If I am buying at Abt solely for price then I better shop around a whole lot more. I am feeling that Abt has such a good business that they are not worried about individual customer complaints. Additionally, the tech was in such a rush when he called in the morning and such a rush when he came for service in the afternoon. It was almost rude."
346,3,"I have no complaints about the sales agents or prices. 9 days after my order, I hadn't heard anything about my appliances' delivery, so I called Abt and discovered the range had been discontinued, but no one had notified me. The agent nicely threw in a little freebie to the order to make them look good. A couple of days later I called in to make sure the right phone number was in the record (we'd dropped our landline) and was told that my appliances were in the nearby city.
I should be hearing from them anytime to schedule the delivery. But 5 days later I'd heard nothing. Abt uses Custom Global air freight and Custom Global contracts with locals to deliver. But their local partner didn't deliver to our area, so the appliances just sat on their dock until I called and raised a ruckus. Terrible order fulfillment and delivery experiences."
347,3,"Purchased all new kitchen appliances and a new washer and dryer. Sales person screwed up the order, deleting the micro from the appliance package we purchased and put the wrong washing machine on the order. (Delivery day came and they didn't have the micro and wrong washer). Had to take more time off work to wait for the correct appliances. Then the freezer didn't work, the fridge hasn't stopped running for 7 days. Took a day off work for the Service tech sent out only to find out they are installation guys and didn't have a clue what they were doing! Now taking another day off work for a certified service tech to come out and fix the problem that was supposed to be taken care of today because they sent out delivery guys instead of a repair guy!!! BEYOND FRUSTRATED."
348,1,"BEWARE!!!! SQUARETRADE not only STOLE MY 15"" high stat MacBook Pro serial number ""C02HL37DV35"", they also STOLE MY IDENTITY!!! They sent me back a piece of rubbish, outdated nonusable MBP with very low stats and ""Lion"" OS with damaged disc. I granted them permission to work on the one I sent. Within an hour charges were racking up all over the place at stores. Since I use a VPN and have various methods of protection the only people who could get my information was SQUARETRADE. The police came and report filed. The police officer spoke with a supervisor there who promised he would send me back MY MBP or one of similar stats that actually worked, and then I would return the non-working piece of trash they sent me.
THEY HAVE NEVER SENT ANYTHING!!! THEY ARE THIEVES and it took me more than a month to correct the original identity theft but it is an ongoing battle. I WANT MY MBP RETURNED TO ME AS THEY TOLD THE POLICE. I still have their trash and will gladly return. The OS is corrupted, just like them. PLEASE, if anyone has my MBP contact the police. This company hides behind warranties to get you to send your products to steal and have access to your information! Never use them. They are thieves, liars, identity thieves. I cannot imagine a worse company. I have never had any place do what they have done in the past 20+ using electronics."
349,3,"This product is poor quality and performs inconsistently. I was using the disposable version and then I decided to try this instead. What a mistake. It worked briefly then started doing this thing where as soon as I take a drag, it starts flashing and produces no vapor. This is supposed to indicate that I'm overusing it, but it does it all the time, as soon as I start using it. Got a replacement battery, it started doing it immediately again. I've done all the cleaning and troubleshooting, makes no difference. Also, it does not hold a charge at all. This product is annoying enough to make you quit quitting smoking."
350,2,"The prices are way too high for the quality of the tanks, Clearomizer, e-liquid. The tanks don't last very long... barely a day and I don't vape all that much. The Clearomizers leak. I've spent so much money on them that it's just sickening. I've since found a vapor stick and it works wonderful. At Blu you buy one tiny bottle of liquid and it's like $9 and now I can get a 60ml bottle for $19. This lasts so long that I can't believe I was taken in by Blu. I've called customer service with issues and problems and they either don't seem to care or the person on the phone just doesn't know.
How can you have customer service reps that are supposed to know their product and they can't answer questions. This company has made a small fortune off me and they just can't seem to provide quality product to the consumer. My last order was for two bottles of liquid and when it arrived there was only one in it. So now I have to call yet again and hop through hoops to get what I paid for. Total waste of my time and money. I'm so glad that I found a store here that has quality product and devices as well as a friendly knowledgeable people on staff to help and also answer any questions. Totally done with blu.com."
351,1,"Upon Rhapsody being acquired by Napster I had approximately $100 in music purchase credits. Both Rhapsody and Napster showed the credits but because they no longer offered song or music purchases there was no return or compensation for the funds in my account. On two occasions their associates confirmed the credits and were going to apply them to my monthly user access until the credits were used. This never happened, and they have now refused to provide communications or assistance in providing access to my Samsung TV when trying to attempt activation that recognizes my account and provides an activation code to enter that returns with an incorrect activation code.
It appears that this company is now owned and operated by a foreign subsidy that appears to be milking the Napster accounts without providing services being paid for nor providing client follow up. It would be my recommendation that each of us contact our State Attorney Generals and request that a class action suit be filed on the behalf of all subscribers both past and present.
We have seen nearly all Online or Internet services companies posting the changes that have followed the Facebook, Google, etc. failures in meeting the end user privacy legislation changes. This is not so with Napster and this alone should be recognized as a violation with Napster's operations within the United States. We can no longer let foreign or domestic non-storefront businesses continue to fleece Americans due to both intentional complexities as well as their intended avoidance with isolation from communications in operating any business license."
352,1,"My husband and I were with Rhapsody for a long time until Napster took over. Money begin missing from them overcharging us. Interrupting services with claims they didn’t receive payment even though I had proof they did. I ended up canceling my he Family Plan and switching to a better more honest music app. My husband wanted to stay with Napster because of all the music he had. It was going fine the first few months then he downgraded to a smaller plan. They took the money out our account but insisted the card didn’t go through. I advised them our bank had verified they were not holding funds. That Napster had indeed taken the funds.
I spoke to a supervisor at Napster and told him I’d send him my statement. He refused it and said I did not pay and insisted they didn’t receive any funds from me. He again refused to see my statement for proof. This company is full of and should be shut down. It’s run by a bunch of foreigners with bad attitudes that can only call you. You can not call any of the numbers back. Save your money. Don’t pay for Napster when there are plenty of other apps that are run by honest people."
353,2,"I have been a longtime subscriber of Rhapsody. Did not like the re-branding to Napster but stuck it out anyway. Back in April, I launched my app and got a prompt to update my account asap. Doing so, I accidentally created a new subscription! I already had a subscription and did not need another. I immediately contacted Napster/Rhapsody through their help channel telling them I made this mistake and that I would be contacting my bank. BTW the site is automated and you can't speak to anyone. Right away I canceled my subscription and contacted my credit card company. Just found out from my bank, that Napster will not refund me the money and they want proof of my error, just for an accidental subscription! If you click on the help link in their email, it opens to a blank page! There are better music streaming services available. Time for me to go exploring!"
354,1,I will NEVER use Rhapsody again! I was just charged today for my monthly billing and this afternoon my bank just called to inform me that my debit card has been hacked and I have to get a new one because my acct was hacked from using and paying Rhapsody! Now I'm with customer support demanding my money back and all they want to tell me is that I can close my account with Rhapsody. What? Seriously? They don't care that my personal information has been hacked because of them only that if I feel the need I can just close my account!! What a crock!! PEOPLE DO NOT USE RHAPSODY!!!
355,1,"Why in the world did they discontinue the sound equalizer on computer app? Seems like I can access it on my Android, but nothing doing on computer. Some of my downloads are from the 60's, of mono quality, but the new software prevents you from adjusting the quality of the sound.
My biggest complaint is the constant BUFFERING. Songs begin playing and then just stop for no reason whatsoever. Customer service [again, agreeing with the masses that it's a total joke] told me to uninstall and reinstall new software. Still no stopping the buffering. I always use WiFi as an interface, as recommended by T-Mobile and Rhapsody customer service. I also have a WiFi hot spot on my smart phone so I can get apps, etc. when traveling through zones with poor WiFi service. Rhapsody still buffers! The only way around this is to access libraries you've permanently downloaded onto your sim card.
And finally, apparently the new software allows you to queue up to three playlists for your constant listening pleasure, but you can't pick and choose within the libraries which songs you wish to hear, and which you wish to skip. If you queue up the playlist, you're stuck with all of them. And, in the case of a long road trip where you might want to listen to the random song mixer, no such doing on the smartphone app.
I'm tired of being billed for poor customer service, software that keeps changing, an obvious push into streaming music and unradio application, and an obvious sham/scam when it comes to previously downloaded, paid-for music, that's no longer available. Can someone say ""theft""????"
356,1,"There has been a charge on my iPhone for an annual membership of a fitness program which I don't use. As soon as the charge appeared, I initiated canceling it on my phone, realizing this was not what I intended to buy. Especially for one year membership and a fee of $99.99. I went under my ""purchase history"" and cancelled the subscription. I also called the bank and disputed the charge. Then I followed up by calling iTunes to make sure I was not paying for that. All of that happened end of May and June and I am still writing and calling with no resolution.
I have called several times, written several letters and argued my case with several managers since the charged appeared in May. The managers are rude and unprofessional and they tell me there is nothing they can do because it has been over 60 days since the charge appeared!!! That is a lie since I have been calling since day 2. They drag your case so days go by and they claim you are responsible for not pursuing your case. That is 100% lies. They are the most unprofessional and rude managers I have ever talked to. Instead of resolving your case, they argue and insult. They are liars. I know how hard I have tried to remove this charge on my end from day 2. Three managers either got disconnected or hang up on me but they never called back. I want to take them to small claim court and I don’t care how much more money this is going to cost me. This is a joke. They are thieves."
357,1,"I was sick of cd's and the radio while out driving distances so agreed a three month free trial and £9.99 per month after the free period. Which I assumed covered me to search for a song & add it to my playlist. After the free trial I noticed each month a payment of £9.99 was going to iTunes from my PayPal which I thought was normal. It wasn't until a while after I noticed some months another 2 payments of £9.99 were being taken 2 different dates of the month and random £1.99's and £3.99's were also being taken from my bank account. I notified the bank who cancelled the payments.
iTunes continued to take them so my bank had to cancel my card and issue me a new one. I have also reported iTunes to PayPal and cancelled the transaction with PayPal and cancelled iTunes altogether. I've tried constantly to rectify it. The only way I can get a response is via email. Firstly they said ""different department can't comment on it for security reasons."" I told them I want to know why they have taken it and I want it refunded, they just email back ""what Matthew said was correct, you may have another email address that was charged."" This means nothing, I didn't agree take what you want when you want. Please beware."
358,3,"I was recently noticed a charge from Apple that was taken from my checking account. The charge was for an Norton's for 29.99 that I never subscribed to. When they withdraw the funds from my acct it caused an overdraft fee of 35.00. I contacted Apple and was told, ""We are sorry that was done in error and we will refund this within 10 days."" As far as the overdraft fee I was on my own for their error. I was told I would be provided an email to provide to my bank to get the money back.
I never received the email and called back minutes later to be told that such email exists and hold on. I held for 20 mins until I was disconnected. So not only did you take money in error as you say you caused my acct to overdraft and cost me another 35 dollars in which again I have to take the time to call the bank and get this money put back in, also wait 10 days to get my own money back. This is the worst I have seen. Unacceptable customer service and poor management as far as withdrawing funds that were not authorized."
359,2,"Earlier today I needed to purchase a navigation app for my new car. I purchased the app via my cell phone while at the dealership. There were a number of problems getting connected and I left with the issue unresolved. When I got home I attempted to call iTunes to get more information on the app and find out what additional cables were needed. I called about 5 times back to back, each time the same man answered the phone, and when I told him I had already made the purchase and didn't need to purchase anything, he hung up. After the 3rd attempt I called the number on both my home phone and my cell. The cell call was again cut off--because he probably recognized the number; however the same guy answered the call made from the home phone. When I started talking, he said ""just a minute"" and then played music--on hold I assume. The music played for at least 30 minutes, and eventually that call was disconnected as well.
If I have to go to iTunes, I'll just do without the product. All I needed was assistance for a product purchased from their site. They could have answered the question and been off the call in a matter of seconds. This was a mean-spirited individual, who after 5 calls, gives a pretty good representation of iTunes as a whole. I had thought that iTunes was more of a reputable company. My mistake, I will never use them for anything again."
360,3,"My child unfortunately made charges without me knowing through my Apple store under the game toy blast, it was a whole month worth before I found that I was $358 missing from my account. I then worked with Apple. Gave them all the transaction order numbers, amounts, dates and how much was purchased for them to say a big fat, ""No. We will not refund you!"" I pay attention to my child but here you have a child with these bright colors and asking, ""Do you want more coins!"" Of course. Who doesn't! I did budgeting wise would want to spend that much on a game!!! NOPE.
I am disappointed and frustrated. Have a password but it is a password for the family as we share the iPad... my child is big enough to play game but small to not understand he is purchasing coins with ACTUAL money. Apple thinks different and will rob you of your money in every which way possible. I have been emailing them for a few weeks to nip this in the bud before it got out of control. No response until it got to this much! Do they actually think a adult who works full-time a single mom (not that makes a difference) but it does for with Apple."
361,3,"My son that is 12 ordered free apps but were actually on a free trial period. He's had his account about 5 years so no children account option available at the time. Therefore, I had no parental control. Started receiving charges. Call Apple support and inform them of the issue. They would credit the money back to my bank account and tell us the problem was resolved and we wouldn't see any more charges. What started out about $2 is now up to $56! Today I call to try and figure out how to get to the root of the problem so there won't be any issues. First call is 26 minutes, was placed on hold while the rep credited my account and was to send links on all the ways I can prevent the issue only for her to disconnect the call and not call back.
Call a second time, call last 38 minutes with a rep and supervisor. I was told the previous call a supervisor denied the refund because I've been credited previously. Said in the notes I've received information on how to correct the issues when in reality I had not. Nasty supervisor and by the end of the call she says she can't discuss the account because he's listed as an adult even though she understands he's 12! Are you serious Apple?! She refuses to help any further. So in order for me to dispute the $56 in charges that will reoccur monthly I have to cancel the debit card and dispute the charges with the bank. Problem is, it's my husband's card and he's out of town on business so that would leave him without any funds and he has to be the one to cancel and complete the paperwork anyways. I had previously deleted the card off my son's phone but that also removed it from being able to track.
Can't have that, as the tracking option has saved his phone from a person that stole it last year. In order for me to gain control of his phone I had to lie about his age, and make him 13. No help to Apple support with that either as they didn't provide the information. I've now done everything on my end to stop the charges and just want my money back and I'm only asking for the month of March! We had deleted the apps but didn't realize that doesn't matter. I don't think a 12 year old kid should be able to make purchases! My husband told Apple on the phone they didn't have our authorization to take any funds from our account but we found out the hard way it didn't matter. Due to Tammy (the rude supervisor) I'm making a complaint, which I told her I would be and she didn't care!"
362,1,"My satellite radio stopped working both in my home and in my car. It indicated a 'no signal' message. Through their website I attempted send a refresh signal to the radio several times, but still no signal. I double-checked all wiring connections and they were fine. I test the radio several times by turning it off, waiting 10 seconds and turning it back on. I re-positioned the antenna and still no signal. I tried a backup satellite radio that had never been used and I had the exact same problem: no signal in the house or in the car. I spent 3 1/2 hours, a significant amount of that time on hold, and was cut off twice. I spoke to a total of 6 ""tech support"" personnel repeating the same basic troubleshooting steps countless times. I was finally told that the modules in both my docking stations had gone bad. To anyone with a gram of common logic, the odds that the docking modules, BOTH in my home and in my car, would start malfunctioning at the EXACT same time are astronomically against this conclusion. Therefore, I reject this preposterous, inept diagnosis. After reading the complaints on the web about Sirius XM and listening to their repeated question - ""How old are your radio(s)?"" - I am fairly convinced that they are trying to get me to buy all new equipment. I have subscriptions on two radios, one for my adult son, that are paid through to December and September 2015 respectively. I tried yesterday to cancel and receive a refund. However, after being put on hold again for 15-20 minutes, the representative said she couldn't hear me. When I said I wanted to ""purchase a new radio"", she did hear that, but caught herself mid-sentence and went into her deaf mode once more. I want to cancel and I've read about the consumer complaints with the thousands of documented cases of the extreme difficulty of terminating a SiriusXM subscription. Is there a class action lawsuit in the state of Texas that I can sign onto? Please advise. Thank you for your indulgence."
363,2,"They pretend to talk like they're based in the US, almost overusing ""ya"" and ""no worries."" Fact is they're in the Philippines and they DO find your address (not from the dealer but from the DMV records they obtain so wherever your car registration goes, they'll send you several (I got 12 correspondences before signing up post free trial). I'm about up for renewal and tried to ensure my card wasn’t on file (changed cards anyway) but they lied *surprise* and stated that do not save anyone's credit card info. Guess they don't read these.
Anyway, no charges yet just impossible to get someone to help. Found a 6 month for 9.99 offer and nobody there would honor it. Sales guy (claims he was in the Caribbean) was such a chump - RUDE, obviously hates being a low paid phone rep because he definitely went into customer service. Tried to add our 2nd car and calling customer service for XM is such a daunting task that I'd seriously rather fold laundry or do some other mundane home chore. No more XM. They're a serious headache."
364,1,"Your customer service team is horrid! I called to open an account & gave your rep my conditions: 1) My service would begin July 1, 2015 and end June 30, 2016; 2) I would agree to pay ""x"" $ for that service. He agreed not once but twice, then took my info. At the end, he changed those agreements. Then when he couldn't honor my terms he agreed to, he sent me to another rep who told me she couldn't help me either. I chatted with your service team and ignored the conversation I had with the first Sirius rep I spoke with that agreed to my terms. Needless to say this has been a horrible start to a short relationship with your company. You guys don't honor your words!
I will use all media outlets possible and reviews to expose the unprofessional way I have been treated by your company and it's representatives. No person should ever be treated this way. Either honor the deals you agree to, or tell the consumer up front a deal can't be negotiated. Don't agree to terms and then go back and change the terms after you agreed upon them. That is disgraceful and totally unprofessional! You should be ashamed!
BEWARE! First impressions are usually good indicators of future behavior! For the record, I have never been under contract with Sirius Radio. I had a trial period where I listened and it expired. Almost a year and 1/2 go by and I negotiate a deal that they agree to and then modify when I am getting ready to give my credit card info. Don't waste your time with this company, I learned all I needed to know about their business practices and in the end am happy I am not nor will ever be a customer of theirs!"
365,2,"After being a whole year without Sirius radio subscription, they went and renewed my subscription without consent and charged it to my credit card (early March 2015). First time I called, they convinced me to accept the subscription at less than 1/2 price. Credit card was never reimbursed, and radio did not work. Second call I asked to cancel the subscription, told there would be a fee for cancellation. A month later, still no refund. Called again, said someone forgot to check a box in the demand and that it would be a couple of days and there is no fee for cancellation when done within a prescribed period of time (which they could not tell me what that time was).
Called again mid May, and now they said they do not refund the credit card but send out checks. The process would take about 1 month from my original call. They said the check should be in the mail, but could not show me any proof of refund, check number, transaction number... I then told them I would wait 2 weeks before bringing them to small claim court. Lo and behold, credit card has been refunded today. Not a way to do business. I will never take another subscription with them again."
366,1,"I just got stiffed by these crooks after I tried to transfer my new car, something they did the first time. I did this in 2013. I was ""sold"" a Lifetime subscription to SiriusXM, back in 2009. I wasn't looking for the deal, and remember I was just calling to make a payment. Today, same scenario, except I was told that the plan didn't cover car maker installed sets, only portable units. So I reminded the idiot that I did it before and paid a $75 fee, that incidentally I was never advised when I asked back in 09. I was then informed ""we did it as a courtesy"" yet I wasn't told that at the time, of said ""courtesy"". I was reminded that I must have read the terms and conditions... I guess over the phone... So now the lifetime plan with ""3 free vehicle transfers"" seems to only one and the not free at all.
I recall telling the thief that sold me this garbage plan that I always upgrade vehicles every 2-4 years sometimes more, so I didn't see this as something for me. But she assured me that I get 3 (maybe 4?) vehicle changes, didn't matter when, so it's seemed like a pretty decent deal. Now I am told that it was only for portable units. But since I never owned one in the first place, why on earth would I have needed that plan then anyway! And I think that would have/should have been relayed back in 2013 upon that transfer. What a bunch of crooks. Beware of these lowlife scum, very shady and totally unethical. They really show they value customers, lol, never will do business with them ever again. Don't trust them, or you'll get burned too."
367,3,"I received a letter from SiruisXM offering a 6 month promotion. At the very bottom of the letter it states will renew after 6 months at the current rate. XM charged my account on 4/22 with no warning and the charge was $102.44. I received another letter for an another renewal of $25 for six months stating the current rate of $14.99 and the same that a renewal will be based of the current rate. The unauthorized charge of $102.44 which equates to $17.07/mo. Did the current rate go up $2.08 in two weeks?
Next complaint is I was excited for the low fee and got it for my dad to travel with me so he could listen to oldies. Never really used it much on my own. He paid the fee, so I wasn't aware of a need to cancel anything but used my card and he paid me. I now see the new letter has this at the bottom. But Sirius XM doesn't sent out any reminders, they just charge the card. My payday hadn't occurred, so when XM charged my card I had low funds in my account. The charge was $102.44 + an NSF fee of $35. The next few charges that day for Amazon, food etc. caused me to be charged 6 more NSF fees total. My bank agreed that if SiriusXM was unwilling to credit this much they would reimburse me with a letter from SiriusXM.
After faxing my personal banking information to god knows where I finally got a message from a I believe. She responded ""I like only see one NSF fee so that is all I'm wiling to send you."" After this message I called her back and she said she didn't know who reviewed it or did she have an office or location. I then spoke with, ID who was extremely rude stating SiriusXM is unwilling to send a letter refusing my reimbursement request. I then asked for someone of a higher level and/or the person who reviewed my activity report and she said ""I can't do that.""
I hung up with her and just called customer service who was in Canada and had NO CLUE. I called again and SiriusXM was busy then got an automated system stating... ""please hang up now"" then a loud beep before the call was disconnected by them. I find that a large company like SiriusXM acted very poorly. I work hard and take care of my family on my own. I had little money for grocery and have suffered terribly from these financial charges (NSF) to my bank. I'm still trying to make up for this and have been charged several more. I only asked SiriusXM for 6 of those. I've contacted legal counsel but am giving this one more shot to see if someone at a higher level will review the bank activity and see the error OR at worst just send me a letter so my own bank can reimburse me. Horrible service..."
368,3,"I booked a roundtrip flight with Orbitz.com in June. Upon review to my trip itinerary today (July), I've found that the departure flight was not book by Orbitz but the return flight was booked. Yet, I was charged for the round trip flight. I did not receive any notice of this from Orbitz (email or phone call). Had I not reviewed this information myself, I would not have known of this issue with my departure flight until the day of checking. This is unprofessional, inconvenient & extremely upsetting. Very POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE."
369,1,"I used to use Orbitz to book my all my business travels. Recently I have made a travel to Geneva returning from Rome. I have made a mistake in the passenger name so I call the next day to ask them to revise it, of course they have to charge me additional fees for that. I was fine with extra fee because I'm responsible for it since I made an error. However, when I left for my business trip I have notice they made an error on my return flight!! They changed my departure location. I have called in orbitz requesting them to make a correct on my flight. They told me it takes them 5 days to check back on the call in order check if they should be responsible for my flight! I am so disappointed, I would never use them to book any of my flights any more. I would suggest my company or any other companies out there to be aware of it. NOT RELIABLE!!!"
370,1,"I am very upset with my experience with Orbitz. I was planning a trip to Texas to see my son graduate from Basic Military Training. We were told to purchase refundable tickets in case the trainee's graduation was postponed for various reasons. When I called Orbitz I asked specifically if my flight tickets would be refundable if my trip to Texas had to be postponed for this reason. She reassured me a number of times that for $44 per ticket, they would be refundable. Then I told her that I possibly may rent a car. After giving me the price of the tickets, she proceeded to give me the price of the car rental.
As I was questioning her about the prices, all of a sudden she told me the price of the tickets went up a considerable amount. Then she said, ""But if you rent the car I can give you a lower price on the tickets."" Red flags suddenly went up but I was so pleased that I was getting refundable tickets I figured paying a bit more for the tickets was worth it. After I told her the times of the flights that I wanted she said I would be receiving an itinerary in my email. I hung up. I saw I received the itinerary, but I did not check it over.
A couple days later I went into my email and noticed one of the flights was not correct. I called Orbitz and the man told me there was nothing he could do and if I wanted to change/cancel the flight it would cost $200 per ticket. Then I figured since I was on the phone with him I would confirm with him the refundable tickets and asked if my tickets would be refundable for the reason stated above. He told me my tickets are only refundable for medical emergencies. Needless to say, I was furious. I cancelled the insurance. I then told him I wanted to talk to a supervisor about the mistake on my flight. He said a supervisor would call me within 48 hours. I waited 2 days... no call. I called them back. Waited a long time on the phone. Finally spoke to a supervisor. It got me nowhere.
The 2 previous people I talked to were foreigners. They were extremely difficult to communicate with. (That's probably why she made a mistake.) I asked the supervisor a few times if she could listen to the recording of my conversation with the girl who placed my reservation, but she totally ignored my request. At the beginning of each phone call they state that the conversation is recorded. If it is, then why can't they go back and listen to it? Isn't that why it's supposedly being recorded? This company is definitely only out to make big bucks. Definitely not customer friendly! I will never do business with them again and I will tell friends, family and acquaintances not to do business with them as well. Next time, I will buy my tickets directly from the airline. Learned my lesson."
371,1,"I have had SiriusXM since I bought a new car in 2010. I liked it so much that I actually called them to sign up again when my service expired. I mean, I really loved 60's on 6! But then I got another new car, and bam, 2 days later the calls started every single day, and sometimes 3-4 times a day. I answered once and refused to sign up before my free trial expired, and they practically begged and pleaded and would not let me go. After that I continued to get daily calls, so I asked them not to call me but they kept calling. Tonight they called again, so I right then and there I cancelled my account.
The nice lady did her due diligence and tried to convince me to stay but I stood my ground. I also told her exactly why I was cancelling and that I wanted to completely sever all ties with Sirius because of this harassing behavior. This is exactly the kind of extremely aggressive marketing and business practices that pisses customers off. I was a 5-year customer and now they've lost me forever. Also, we now have great alternatives on smartphones, paid or free, so satellite radio is becoming less relevant than ever. Don't let this company rope you in because they will never leave you alone."
372,3,"I have been a subscriber for a few years. I purchased a new car in October 2014 which included three free months of SiriusXM radio. When I called to activate, everything went through fine and I was told the balance on my account would be automatically applied after the three month promotion. Great! In December, I started getting these very loud and abrupt renew tones on the radio. I called Customer Service because I thought everything was already set up. Of course it wasn't! Obviously my last call was a complete waste of time. They re-did the transaction. Then the sales rep told me that were having a special promotion where I could receive a free second radio to use at home with a 30-day free promotion and a minimal monthly charge after that. I decided to try it (what was I thinking?). The only thing I had to pay for was the shipping.
When I received the radio, I could not get a signal (no windows facing south). So I had to call Customer Care again. They gave me the information to mail the radio back and told me that they had cancelled the second subscription. I mailed the radio out the next day. A few days later, I received an email confirming that they had received the radio back. I thought all was well (I should have known better). Several weeks later I logged into my account and lo and behold, the second subscription was still active and about to automatically renew! I called Customer Service again. The rep I spoke to said that there would be a $50 early termination fee...for the free promotional period for a radio that I couldn't get a signal for and had returned! I hit the roof with these clowns. They transferred me to sales where a rep admitted that the previous reps probably did not tell me about the early termination fee and didn't properly cancel the second subscription.
When I threatened to cancel all service, then she fixed the error and told me that there wouldn't be an early termination fee even though the confirmation email would say that there might be one. What the heck?? Her explanation was that they don't know exactly what these emails say. For real! So now I am going to have to be vigilant to make sure that there are no inappropriate charges. This is perhaps the worst customer service group that I have ever encountered. I do like the radio service, but if what I encountered this past month is any indication, trying to cancel any type of service is an absolute nightmare. I was going to try their internet radio service, but now I won't because they make it impossible to cancel anything!
Their phone tree is also impossible to navigate. No matter how deep you go, you won't find a selection to speak to a representative. The only way I got through to one was to say ""speak to a representative"" when asked if I wanted choice 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. And their call centers are located overseas which meant that I got to speak to a rep named ""Jay"" whose Indian accent was so thick I couldn't understand him. I kept telling the sales rep throughout our conversation that ""this is how you lose customers.” She also put me on hold for ten minutes. Nightmare service!"
373,2,"Every year in December I receive all sorts of mail offers regarding renewal deals and telephone calls asking me about my intentions about renewing my account. Each year, I'm told the going rate is about $175. For the last 3 years I have worked with the service folks and have negotiated a yearly rate somewhere between $80 and $90. This year however, I received a notice stating that I now have a past due balance of $178.32. A week later, I received another notice stating that my account was overdue and I owed $25.34 and that I could renew my service by paying $176.32.
When I spoke to the service representative last year, I was ""guaranteed"" 1 year of service for $96 if I paid at that moment, which I did. I was told that my end of contract date was January 10, 2015 and I was no longer under ANY OBLIGATION. Today, when I called about the ""past due"" notice, I was told that my account was now past due in the about of $34. I told Janea the representative last year told me that my obligation ended on 1/10 and she told me that it did, but I failed to call to cancel my membership and that my membership was ""suspended"".
I told the Janea again that the previous rep told me that I was paying for 1 year of service and that I was not under any obligation for anything more than that year and she insisted that my account reflected a past due amount. Interestingly, each time I call, I get a different story. I simply will not pay for a service which I did not opt for, nor did I receive. I wish that I could just remove the Sirius hardware from my vehicle. What a racket!"
374,2,"I was going to be without my vehicle for three months so in December when I was scheduled for renewal I just let it lapse. Well they continued to pester with emails and calls etc., which I ignored. The emails said that my service will be discontinued if I did not call to renew which was fine with me. Here is the icing on the cake with these people. I had a small balance because I did not call to cancel and they started sending emails to my ex-husband of FIVE YEARS! I have had my car for three years, his name is on nothing! Yet they sent emails to him about my account. When I called them about this - guess what? They hung up on me four times - listener care and supervisors. I will NEVER have this service again."
375,2,"I have received 1-2 calls everyday from Sirius for a month. My husband had a subscription running from Dec. 2013-Dec. 2014 and we had decided not to opt in for ""automatic renewal"" when we subscribed last year. In December 2014, we decided to NOT renew the subscription. After answering the non-stop, hardcore sales calls twice and declining to renew our subscription, I stopped answering the phone calls from Sirius. Some calls came from our local area code, and Sirius is not based locally, so I assume they are running through spoofed numbers, and some have come from toll-free numbers.
Today, one month after the subscription ran out, I received a call from Sirius billing, demanding $18.79 for an overdue bill. Upon returning the call, I was informed that Sirius had let the subscription run for an extra month as a ""courtesy"" and now wanted payment for that month of unauthorized, unwanted service. I refused to pay and urged Sirius to send me a bill, along with a signed contract or copy of a phone call, wherein I authorized the month of ""courtesy"" service. Really shocking that a company is so desperately, illegally, and unethically demanding money for services that were never authorized. I certainly will not be paying the bogus bill, and I will NEVER subscribe to Sirius again."
376,2,"I recently purchased a baby bunny from Pet Kingdom. She was very sweet and I was instantly attached to her. A day or two after I had her I noticed she was weak and had a large amount of wet stool. I did some research and saw that this could be a sign of a fatal illness. I rushed her to an emergency vet at 2 am in Naples. I found out she was infested with worms and that the worms had caused a bloat in her intestines that is fatal to rabbits. Over a period of three days I racked up over $1300 in vet bills.
She is currently stable but still has quite a fight. I have worked/managed pet stores in the past and am familiar with pet store issues and animals mills. I called Pet Kingdom to make them aware of the situation since these worms are extremely contagious and most likely all the other bunnies are infected. My main concern is the health of all animals and those who purchase their companions. I have purchased animals from pet stores before but this will be my last. BREEDER OR RESCUE ONLY!!!"
377,3,"I am very upset with this pet store... I recently purchased a German Shepherd puppy that was 12 weeks old. She seemed fine at the time. I have had her less than a week and knew there was something wrong with her. She wasn't playful like a normal HEALTHY puppy should be. So I took her into my vet. Come to find out she was running a 103.5 temp and has a major respiratory infection. While we were at Pet Kingdom there was another German Shepherd puppy there that was not moving and look very very thin. I am assuming she caught this from him.
I went onto Pet Kingdom's site to read other reviews and have read a lot of similar reviews stating that people have purchased sick puppies and Pet Kingdom's response to them is to just return the dog for another one or a full refund. SERIOUSLY? This place need an overhaul and to hire new employees who truly care about the well-being of these animals."
378,2,"Hi! I bought a male Chinchilla from this Pet Kingdom and he seemed kinda tired and I thought it was from being looked at in the window and the glass being knocked on. The lady brought him out to me in a towel - Said ""He likes to spray you."" I got him home and his hair was falling out. He just sat in his cage in the hut. I had him a week and he died. I tried giving him water with a syringe and mashed up pellets, but he didn't want any. I called the pet store when I found out he passed away. I said I would bring him back the next day as I couldn't get there before they closed. They wanted to sell me another one and I said ""No."" I got a refund. The store smelled of urine and the dogs and cats were living in feces and urine. Employees don't care about animal welfare and aren't animal lovers. So sad seeing all the sick animals and being in small cages."
379,1,"From the front door it may seem like a awesome pet store, BUT do not be fooled. Just bought an animal yesterday from this ""Pet Kingdom"". The animal we bought was nothing like they told me it would be. It was all just lies. Had to tear up the house to get the stinker out of the wall, went to give it back (not even 24 hours later) and just had accusations and rudeness thrown at us. They are not helpful what-so-ever nor do they even care about the health or well-being of the animals there. The animals in the pet store seem sick; runny noses, fuzzy eyes, wheezing, wounds and sores on the animals... Not to mention, the poor puppies did not have any room in their encounter at all, plus it all reeks of urine.
The owner and staff do not Love animals, they just want Money. It is completely absurd. Very disappointed. EXTREMELY RUDE SERVICE - NOT ANIMAL LOVERS. THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. How can we do something about this?"
380,1,"I'm organizing a group lawsuit against this store. The conditions those animals are kept in are horrible. The puppy I have bought from this place had Giardia Infection and Coccidiosis in addition to kennel cough. As you know Giardia is contagious to humans and other pets. It's not enough to return the sick pet to the store (you have 24 hours from purchasing to return the pet for full refund).
PLEASE get a vet, check your other pets, Kids and yourself for Giardia. Ask the vet for an ELISA test. The parasite not always shows on a regular fecal float test at the vet office. Keep checking monthly fecal float test for the first 3 to 4 months after treatment is completed, followed by an ELISA test to make sure the infection is truly cleared. If you had a bitter experience with Pet Kingdom, please call me with information. This place got to be stopped. No animal deserve to get there. My phone is 869-853-9924."
381,2,"I purchased a Beagle for my wife and kids on Valentines Day 2012. They had fallen in love with him on a previous visit. We would occasionally stop in when we were out and about just to look at all the animals. I have always been against buying from pets stores and instead going through private breeders or sellers. For the same reasons all of these other folks have stated.
The dog ""has papers."" Except after two years, he still doesn't. They won by waiting us out. After nearly a year, I finally gave up. It was always ""We'll get back to you"", or ""There's a holdup with this or that"", etc. No one ever did a thing. I am giving the extremely condensed version of that whole fiasco. I grew up with a Beagle, then had a roommate who had a Beagle that lived with us. I am no expert, although the dog we got from Pet Kingdom was like no Beagle I'd ever been around. Again, long story short. Problem after problem with health and demeanor, etc.
I have also never been a fan of circuses. Over the years, it seems as though Pet Kingdom has turned into as much a kind of mini zoo/animal attraction type of place as a pet store. They really load up on the exotics to draw people in, but do not seem as though they are equipped to properly care for the animals they have. Maybe the bare minimum to pass state standards but that's really a shame. I'm not some hippie treehugger but come on, these animals are clearly not happy or comfortable. And by the comments on here, including mine, it's obvious they are not concerned with operating an ethically proper business."
382,3,"I am very disappointed that there are so many employees and none of them care for the animals in the shop. I first went to check on the Betta section where they always put them in little cups. I almost cry looking at just some of them because the water was all green for most of it and two Betta fishes (maybe more) were dead and many seem like they were about to die too. I just walked away while looking for an employee to talk with. I think those dumb people do not feed them because they also looked very hungry. I felt like punching those fools in the face. How would they feel if that was them in the cage sitting in their piss and until taken into a better place?
I went to speak with the cashier and told her about this situation. They better do something and fix it or it will be sent to the authorities (and YouTube) after I film it. Well I'm just getting started. After checking the Bettas, I saw another dead one in a large tank maybe dead for 2 days now... It was even worse than what I saw earlier. While looking at the rabbits that were displayed for the customers, one of the larger ones jumped over to eat the hamsters' food and none of the employees did anything. Whatever I guess... One day, those who does not care for all living things will be treated the same in their after life. Working in these kinds of environment should have more caring people, not people who want to kill time and play games."
383,1,"I just want to say that anyone that has had a bad experience there should contact an attorney, when it comes to a sick animal and not entitled (as they say) to a full refund because they are absolutely required by law to refund your money if you have a sick pet. Any contract or purchase in the United States, you have 72 business hours to get out of any purchase made. Any attorney would be more than happy to go after a store like this with no charge to you as the consumer. They work based upon contingency. So if you do not get your money back, they do not get paid. Just thought I would put that out there for all of the misfortunate people that have had a bad experience."
384,2,"I purchased a 5-month-old Weimaraner from Pet Kingdom in 2002. After he grew a little, it was very obvious that he was not a pure breed Weimaraner. He grew to be a lean 120 lbs., about 40 lbs. more than the breed standard. My veterinarian believed he probably had Great Dane in his blood line as his muzzle was also very square and not standard to the breed.
Additionally, my dog had health problems from the time I brought him home. The worst was the severe allergies he had to almost everything. He would swell up so much he couldn't breathe and had to be taken to the emergency vet many times over the years. After years of medications and trips to specialists to keep my pet going, he passed away recently with hip dysplasia. In his 11-year life I spent over $25,000 on emergency and additional medical treatments for my dog.
I purchased a second Weimaraner in 2005 from a reputable breeder and we have not had a single vet visit outside of her regular visits. She has been healthy and I believe it is because of good breeding. Unfortunately, my first dog who I loved so very much did not start off with the same good genes and Pet Kingdom is to blame for that."
385,1,"Wanted to buy a puppy but found all the puppies in a very poorly situation at the Plantation store and customer service is horrible. I decided to visit the other stores in Davie and Kendall where my experience was even worst. First off at the Kendall store they tried to sell me a puppy that I was not even interested in. It almost seem they were low in sales or something. All these 3 stores are managing by people that don’t care about animals but themselves and how many sales they can bring to the table, and I got it it’s a business but your puppies are in very bad conditions, and your customer service is bad because your employees seem to be under a lot of pressure by sales! Get your managers straight and your company culture should change to animal care more so than straight sales. Never again will come back. And to all the people that is looking for a puppy do yourself a favor and go somewhere else, do your research."
386,1,"We lost our Chiweenie and had always rescued dogs, but came across a Chiweenie puppy at Topeka, Kansas Petland. She was adorable and funny and we decided to take her home. The sales pitch is ridiculous. The employee races through this gigantic binder full of so called “benefits” of buying with them. Then, after basically saying you get the dog and all this extra stuff at no additional charge, your head is kind of spinning and you’ve lost track of what was promised and what is even necessary to have. In the end, we have about 15 things we don’t need that we actually paid for (kennel, we had one; sprays, peanut butter roller ball, stuffed animals, etc...). $2000 for a mix breed puppy? Force you to buy $300 in junk!
We were also charged $99 for some warranty that we didn’t agree to purchase. They are sure to stress that a coughing dog is nothing to worry about and that kennel cough is a fake thing and that it’s not covered in any warranty!!! Well, we get the dog home and guess what? She’s coughing all over the place! We’ve got her on medication, but she’s still coughing. Now, we are taking our other dog to the vet tomorrow because she’s sick now.
I love the puppy we got, but wished we hadn’t supported this type of criminal activity. They are scammers and they don’t care about the animals or about the people buying them. They basically trick you into paying for tons of extra things by acting like you have no choice and I’m sure they pay nothing for these animals and then sell them for thousands! You cannot return the animal if you change your mind or if the animal doesn’t work for you. Do not buy from here! If you do, pay with a credit card so you can go back and fight the charge if you have issues. We are contacting our credit card company if they don’t allow us to return all the things we are not using that they forced us to buy."
387,1,"Purchased a King Charles Cavalier in May 2017. Dog had kennel cough, but I waited until she was cured before taking her home. I was told she came from a reputable Amish breeder. Recently I noticed she was not walking right on her back legs. As required, after contacting Petland, I was told to take her to the Petland vet. She was diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia. Then Petland told me to call Pet Solutions the company that handles the guarantees. After numerous calls to them I still have not received a course of action or a resolution to this serious problem. If she came from a reputable breeder this could not have happened as it is a hereditary condition. They recently had another Cavalier from the same breeder and they were aware of this problem with mine and still did not remove the dog from being on display for sale. At this point I do not know what further action I can take to rectify this situation. I really need help.
Updated on 06/23/2018: In spite of all efforts I cannot get any satisfaction from either Petland or Pet Solutions the guarantee company, and now it is almost the end of June. The guarantee they give with the dogs are useless because if you need to use it all you get from them is that paperwork needs to be done or they didn't receive paperwork needed. Paper documentation was sent to them 3 different times. My advice to anyone considering buying a dog from Petland is NOT to walk away from Petland BUT TO RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN."
388,3,"We bought a Shiba Inu May 13, 2018 as a Mother's Day gift for $3300. We were told that the $500 off promo they had plus the $100 off upon reserving was already taken out of the price. This was the first flag, surely a Shiba Inu from a pet store is not that expensive?! Unless the puppy has a legitimate line? When asked about the puppy's parents we were told that they were AKC registered, no other response regarding pedigree information. Upon reading the paperwork afterwards, they are only ACA registered, and I can't find any information online about the sire and dam of 'Tri-Star Kennels'. When we were at the store, the puppy pooped soft to watery stools 3x.
We thought she was just stressed. Brought her home and diarrhea continued in the car and in the house. Did not sleep due to her pooping all night till morning. Brought her to the vet they say she has worms and giardia virus. She's been coughing and still pooping with blood. I have had dogs, never did I see them in the state this Shiba is in. They have a return option in 48 hrs but charges 50% of the pet's purchased price that we have to pay as admin fee?!"
389,1,"My daughter went to Petland in Iowa City to purchase a puppy who was going to be trained as a service dog for her. The staff reassured her that the puppy she fell in love with was a perfect match. Having spent a small fortune for the puppy she then took the pup to the vet that Petland recommend. They put the pup on antibiotics straight away. Over the next day the pup went to a registered trainer who noticed very quickly that the pup was very sick. Dreadful hacking cough, not eating at all - regardless what she tried to give her, very lethargic & very runny stools.
We contacted the store whom said that there was nothing wrong with the pup. In the end we took the puppy back to the store. She was in such a sick state. It was such a heartbreaking experience for my daughter to go through - there was no way this puppy should have been sold to my daughter. Esp as the staff knew it was to be a service animal. Please Please Please beware of the state these poor animals in. They are too many dogs in each crate that is one has a illness they will all get it. The stench when walking into the store was horrendous. Never again will I ever have anything to do with this company."
390,1,"EVERYTHING about this place is absolutely HORRENDOUS!! Everyone please read this! I purchased a puppy from this establishment. I purchased him because I felt sorry for him and my kids really wanted him. We asked to see the puppy and when they brought him to us he smelled so disgusting I wanted to throw up! Every one of the cages had urine and feces all over. When I made the final decision to purchase the puppy I asked the associate to please give him a bath because he stunk so bad. They told me they would take him back to give him a bath. So when they took him back I watched through the glass and they did not give him a bath. All they did was spray him with dog cologne. I still took him anyways, even though I wasn’t happy about that.
When we were doing the paperwork, I flat out asked the associate if he had all his shots. He showed me the paperwork that showed the shots that he has received and told me that yes he had all the shots except for rabies. The associate told me that all he needed was rabies and his yearly shots. This was a complete lie to my face. I took the puppy to the veterinarian 4 days after purchasing him and the veterinarian told me that he needed several series of shots still that were going to cost me even more money. This establishment is ripping people off! They charged me over $2000 for this puppy that isn’t even recognized as a breed with the AKC. The associate also lied to my face when I asked point-blank about the refund policy. I also found out when the puppy was being examined by the Veterinarian that he had health problems that is also going to cost me more money! Do NOT buy a puppy from this place! They need to be put out of business!"
391,1,"I ordered a Choat Leopard Wrasse and two other wrasse. The day my order was supposed to ship I got an email saying the order was canceled. I called to ask why and was told since the Choat Wrasse was available but the other two were not they canceled my order. I asked if they could just ship the Choat Wrasse. They said that I would have to place a new order. I then placed a new order for 2 Choat Leopard Wrasse and asked that if both were not available to please send at least one.
I called several times including the day of shipment to verify this. The day the order was to ship they canceled my order again. I called to find out why and was told they had only one Choat Wrasse so the order was canceled. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I then asked if I could reorder just one and was told no they were out of stock. The website showed the Choat Wrasse were in stock several days after the order was canceled even though I was also told the website updated once a day. Stay away from Pet Solutions parent company of Petland."
392,1,"I am a very unsatisfied customer. I purchased a very sick Bull Mastiff last spring. At the time of purchase she had a slight runny nose. (This purchase was made on a Friday). I was informed this was normal and that she was fine. Then on Monday she was hospitalized for a severe case of pneumonia. I was not guaranteed that she would survive. I tried getting in contact with a manager there and was told that I needed to contact another company to report this to. Also at the time of purchase, I was rushed through all the paperwork and was not explained everything that was included. She was financed through a 3rd party and I ""wasn't"" given all of the paperwork.
It took me almost a year to get a copy especially of the ""guarantee"". Also when I took her to my vet for the pneumonia, I found/saw that there was a possible heart defect. On the paperwork from her wellness check, it was handwritten to have the heart rechecked. Months later I have taken her back due to other problems, my vet recommends me to have her spade. There is no guarantee, due to her size, that she would be able to carry a litter. I have an AKC registered English Mastiff that I wanted to breed her with and cannot. (FYI... on the guarantee form, that I was rushed through, says there is no guarantee on being able to breed or on show quality).
My vet has informed me that she is the ""smallest"" Mastiff she has ever seen. (1 year old @ 80 lbs.) If I bred her with my Mastiff, it would kill her. NOW, we are working to have surgery on her eyes and have had to deal with ""dog acne"". These are hereditary traits. I was trying to contact the breeder, but guess what, they are being investigated also. What I don't understand is, WHY does Petland charge so much for the animals if there is no guarantee? I have tried to solve this problem and I keep getting the run around from them and Solutions.Pet, that now I'm going public!! I DO NOT recommend Petland of Kennesaw. I'm glad I have my Annie Oakley. She is part of our family regardless of her health. We will continue to take care of her and love her. Do your homework before making a purchase from here. I wish I had."
393,1,"I purchased a puppy from Petland Malls of Georgia 26 Dec 2017. We found the puppy we were looking for. When I asked they stated she was a purebred English Bulldog. All the paperwork they show/gave me states English Bulldog. They have a 3rd party do all their AKC registration, was instructed they have prepaid for everything for you. Today I went into AKC's website to look up information on her and she is listed with them as ""All American Dog"". I contacted Petland where I purchased her, in which they in turn had me call their Management group. Pet Solutions is their management group, they stated that they are not responsible for validating that the animals are purebred animals. Who in their right mind would pay the price for a purebred with papers and it not be? Buyer beware!"
394,2,"Very disappointed in the service Hartsdale store. I went there with my daughter's doodle today to get groomed. There was a sign on the door, ""We value military and offer a discount."" The doodle dad is leaving next week to his next station in Hawaii. I asked the girl about the discount. Could I have him email his ID for the discount and she was like, ""No. We only offer that on Tuesday."" Really military appreciation on one day only. She said she was going to give me $10 off for a new customer. I was like, ""That's great."" I went to get the dog and paid the bill. When I got home I realized that I didn't get the money off... I called and she was like, ""Listen. I was doing you a favor. If I have to credit you back the money I have to get a manager involved."" I was so mad. I just hung up. Now I know not to shop PetSmart as they only appreciate military one day a week."
395,2,"Took my dogs to stay the weekend. Picking them up I noticed the white paws were wet up to the dew claws and yellow. All four. I smelled them. It was urine. My dog was standing in urine. How much urine since it was up to his dew claws. He's 65 pounds and a tall dog. When I got him home I noticed that his entire body smelled. I had to bathe him immediately. He now has a rash on his underside. It seems that he was lying in urine. I got a report that my other dog threw up bile. He obviously had no food. Don't tell me you would feed them your food if you limit the portions. He's 80 pounds. Why was he so hungry. The store (hotel) in Farmingdale, NY is a little more caring to the dogs but they are rude to the customers. The Huntington (yes, Huntington, NY) store is the worst. I dealt with them years ago and stopped going."
396,2,"I took my 7 month old Maltipoo to get groomed (She had been groomed a couple times before being spayed---just puppy cuts). The guy who groomed her told me he was going to trim her ears, ended up shaving all the hair off, looks silly! Also, called me 4 hours later to tell me he couldn't cut her hair. She's a 6 lb. puppy! He told me I should sedate her. She seemed a tad traumatized when I got her back. He also told me she doesn't like to be left alone (it's my dog and know this) and said, ""If you have neighbors and leave her outside, you should know that."" I snapped back, ""We only leave her for a couple hours at a time in a playpen and we have a damn Amazon video camera on her so I know EXACTLY how she behaves when we are gone."" NOT going back."
397,3,"I took my dog (Maltese, 8lbs., 3 years old) to PetSmart Hotel in Johns Creek, GA. on Peachtree Pkwy for a 4 day overnight stay. The very first day, I received a phone call saying that he had a small cut under his eye and it was also stated that he played with other dogs. My dog is not supposed to play with other dogs because he is not neutered. So, failure #1: apparently they did not read his records and failure #2: what was going on that he received a cut under his eye. They did ask if I wanted to take him to Banfield Hospital located in PetSmart, but I told them to watch him over the next couple of days. Of course they tried to say the cut wasn't bad to save themselves. At that point, I couldn't do much because I was on my way out of town. I called back the next day to check on him. I was told he was very snappy so the staff didn't have a chance to take him out. Failure #3, this is an eight pound, small dog who can't do anything but bark.
No one has ever complained about taking him out for a walk because he is snappy. I also wanted my dog to have a bath when I picked him up. When I get to the hotel at 7:30 AM, I was told my dog did not have a bath because ""he didn't like them very much"". They also had the nerve to say, this must be his first time here. Okay, it’s clear they don't pay attention to the records at all because they would have seen that he has been to this particular PetSmart Hotel before and I never had issues like this. I also I did not receive the pamphlet on how he did during his stay. I will be getting him seen by a veterinarian asap. If my dog has some serious health issues behind this stay, corporate office/management will be hearing from my attorney. Very Dissatisfied Customer."
398,2,"I was having difficulty with leash training for my Husky mix. We usually don't care for choke or prong collars, but we had tried harnesses and leather collars and she chewed them up while she was wearing them and even during walks. So we bought a Top Paw choke chain, thinking she can't chew it up, right? well, it broke. At first it didn't occur to me that this was a bad quality product, even though my dog is only 50 lbs. So I went back to PetSmart and bought a prong collar. I bought it in the store, so I didn't think of reading the online reviews which was a big mistake. I fitted the collar according to the tag ""rest gently on the neck"" not too tight, not too loose.
But the links in the collar just came apart during a walk, which resulted in my dog running into traffic and getting killed by a truck. The collar didn't break, it just unclasped, and my dog wasn't pulling hard, she was barely putting any force at all. When I started looking into it, I found that I am not the only one. Some people have had this specific collars fitted by professional trainers and it would still come apart, some people say they have tried other brands and this problem is only with Top Paw, many people have had their dogs run off because of this issue and PetSmart has known about it for over a year.
They know this is a safety issue and they haven't done anything about it, not even a label on the collar to advise of this safety concern so that people take the necessary precautions. When I contacted PetSmart about it they tried to blame it on me, saying the collar comes with an user guide that explains this, which is a lie. The collar does not come with a warning nor an user guide, the tag in the collar says you can buy additional tips separately as if a safety warning is optional to provide. They don't care about the safety of our pets, they only care about making money. I understand it is a business and businesses need money, but no matter what, you cannot sell products that are unsafe and much less without a warning.
And these collars are not even the only unsafe product sold at their stores. There is a large quantity and variety of bones that are unsafe and can easily kill a dog, I never buy them because as a Veterinary Assistant I know the dangers of those products. But not everyone knows about it, just like I didn't know about their brand of collars. And just like many others I trusted PetSmart and their products with the safety of my babies, but unfortunately they don't care about safety and continue to sell bad quality and dangerous products."
399,2,"I've had my medium-haired cat shaved at PetSmart for the past two years. I made an appointment about two weeks ago for this morning at 7:30, bundled the cat into her carrier and headed to PetSmart. Checking her in, I produced her rabies vaccination certificate, and was asked if she has any health problems. No, I said. Then I was asked if she had a heart murmur. She has been diagnosed with a slight murmur -- but so have I and no one tells me I can't run ultramarathons or anything.
So I said, yes, but she's not on treatment for it because it's not serious. And they refused to shave her. I said, ok, what if I told you she doesn't have a heart murmur, and they said, no, can't do it. The question is -- why didn't they ask these questions when I made the appointment? And why don't they have a waiver or indemnification clause? I've had the same thing done twice before with no problem. They must've had a cat die on them and then blamed it on a heart murmur. Ridiculous. I""m going to start shopping for dog food and cat food and turtle food by mail."
400,2,"Called PetSmart/Banfield regarding my dog's ear infection. I explained to the receptionist that my dog would absolutely not let anyone examine her and that we've been down that road before. (Previously, I had to swab my dog in order for them to run the lab work) so taking her in for an examination is a waste of my time unless the plan is to put her to sleep for a simple ear examination... I told her that I'd misplaced the ear drops and never completed the cycle hence why she is displaying the same exact symptoms, mind it has only been about 2.5 weeks since her ear infection was diagnosed.
I asked if they could please provide a new Rx since it was pretty clear it never healed properly. I called about 5 p.m., was told they'd speak to the Dr. and someone would call me back. I called again ""before they close"" around 6:20 p.m....the receptionist stated Dr. is still there and that I would get a call back around 7. The receptionist (not the Dr.) called back and stated Dr. would need to see my dog in order to make a determination whether she would require same med, etc.
I told the girl once again that my dog will NOT let anyone examine her, and if I could speak with the Dr...at this point she had already became defensive and her tone was altered, she proceeded to place me on hold, came back and said Dr. is now off the clock and there's nothing she could do and ended call. I tried calling back and of course once place is closed, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of anyone, not even management.
The point to my review here, is that the Dr. could not take one minute out of her day to speak with me regarding my dog. The customer service turns ugly if you don't follow their protocol of ""nickel and diming"" the customer. I've gone to PetSmart Banfield for some years now for my cats, turtle and recently for my German Shepherd. I've always looked the other way when they came at us with their nickel and diming, but now it's different, my German Shepherd is in pain and the Dr. could not even take the time to speak with me.
Isn't that their job? To care for animals? If you don't appreciate your job as an animal caregiver then leave. Pets are our just like our children and if I called Kaiser and asked to speak with my sons Dr. and she told me she was off the clock and refused to get on the phone with me, that would be completely absurd, right? PetSmart along with Banfield has lost a customer."

402,1,"I ordered their eating plan program on 2/26/13 online for $139.  3 weeks later I noticed an add'l charge of $64 on my VISA card.  I called the company to inquire, spoke to a woman named Nakia, who informed me that I chose (online) to enroll in their online program, which I did not.  I pointed out to her that not only did I not enroll, but I've never used the online program.  She said she could not remove the charge but would see to it that I was not charged in the future.  When I asked to speak to her supervisor, she stonewalled me, until I said, Are you refusing to pass me on to your supervisor?  She said that was correct.  I hung up, contacted my cc company, and they reversed the charge on the spot. In fairness, from what I see of their actual program, it looks quite good.  However, these practices are fraudulent."
403,1,"I often buy cuttle fish in frozen department. Recently I found out the actual weight is not what it listed on the price tag. Marina Food is overcharging me for the food I'm paying for. On the price tag, it's listed 1.9LBS (860grams). However, when I weighted the castle fish, it only weights 300grams. I can understand a tolerance of 50grams. But, 560grams ripoff? That's way too much. I still have one cuttle fish that I bought the same with the one I just weighted and consumed which can be used as evidence. I can't imagine how many more consumers Marina Food has been ripping off over years on various products. Hopefully we will get help on preventing businesses treating consumers as their free milk tickets."
404,1,"DECEIPTFUL BUSINESS PRACTICES! Stay away from doing business with them I signed up for their mailed items. Without my knowledge I was charged an additional charge of $64 for their online service-FOR WHICH I DID NOT SIGN UP FOR! When I called customer service –LONG WAIT ON THE PHONE the person refused to help, said I should have cancelled the first 2 weeks (- which I could not do since I did not know I was signed up) and refused to pass me to a supervisor or another customer rep. I called the next day and got that same person-Roxanne- on the phone with the same comments. Talked to 2 other people- Michelle & Rebecca with the same comments. DECEIPTFUL BUSINESS PRACTICES! Stay away from doing business with them."
405,1,"On April 14th in the afternoon, we went to Food City to pick up a few things. I picked up a loaf of bread, well the next day - early am, well guess what?? This bread is already MOLDY! This is not the first time, about 6 months ago, I opened a loaf of Food City bread and it looked like a car mechanic handled it, looked all dirty.. ewww. So I went back to the store and customer service informed me it was moldy. I was not happy. The hassle involved of returning a loaf of bread, quite honestly the people in customer service are not the highest skilled people we know and most have the communication level of like a third grader, I left the store rolling my eyes over the time I wasted was really annoyed. This is my second bad bread event. I will also warn you about their seafood as well. I thought I was getting a deal on lobster tails one day, brought them home, of course the next day they had been spoiled as well. It STUNK! NASTY! Not only is this inconvenient, but I get really annoyed when I waste money! Result - SHAME ON FOOD CITY - POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE - SELLING FOOD THATS BAD OR EXPIRED! SHAME SHAME SHAME PS That Valu Card thing is dumb, if you have one you save money, the poor sucker that doesn’t gets ripped!"
406,3,"Grocery stores often have promotional sales. Many time their sales register is not programmed to the sale price. If a customer finds a mistake then a store like Kroger will give you that item for free. I had reported this type of mistake to Food Lion manager many times over the last few months.  All they do is give you the difference. So the system is always in their favor and the customer is always ripped off. Unless the store has a policy like Kroger, they are always at an advantage and keep ripping off the customers. The system Kroger has gives an incentive for the business (store) to fix the problem. "
407,2,"I signed up for the food lovers online trial and inexpertly charges place on card. I called and canceled, but according to them, they have no record. I don't think fair to the consumer they must call or cancel some fine print state free for 14 and you need to cancel or you get billed. The charge was entered 11/5/13, I found the charge and called the same day expecting full refund. I received no help from your customer care, telling me they show no record so its my problem. I believe this deceptive and predatory practice employee by companies that take people money and are not honest companies. Please refund my 64.87. What happened to the customer comes first? Its easy to say we show no record. I have done research, and I'm not the only one this has happened to."
408,1,"Placed my order with Food Service Warehouse on July 28th, 2016 at which time they charged my credit card, which I thought was odd at the time since usually charges are made once items have shipped. It has now been over one month and despite my trying to contact them via email and phone, I have received no items or response.  I have now found out that they are bankrupt and believe that this is all a scam to get money up front!  Website now states that it is Under Construction and that their warehouse is experiencing delays in existing orders.  This is totally ridiculous... Scammed!"
409,1,Do not order from this company. I ordered online a 4 compartment sink beginning of May they took my money but I have not been able to speak to a person by phone or internet since I ordered after leaving many messages by both. I don’t know if or when I will get my order they have taken 875 dollars from my account. They also have a F rating with the BBB. Look somewhere else this company is a joke.
410,3,"I purchased chicken thighs at Smart and Final Lodi CA store yesterday, there was an inordinate amount of skin and fat hidden on the underside in the package, also some with large pin feathers. This is not the first time I've noticed this unfair practice and sloppy clean up of the chickens, but it is the first time I have complained. It seems to have gotten worse in the past year or so, and enough is enough. Foster Farms used to stand for quality, so get it together again or lose a customer. I'm not paying for fat and skin and deceptive packaging."
411,3,"Worst online ordering experience of my life. Saved my appetite all day for the biltong to arrive, and when I ate it I got ill. I had eaten nothing before or after... I had to throw out over $100.00 of biltong that I had planned to share with my family from South Africa. The company was incredibly rude and would not provide a refund and was not at all understanding or helpful with the situation. I have never dealt with such an awful online store in my life. Terrible product, HORRIBLE service.  "
412,2,"Food Offends Is the More Appropriate Moniker I love food trends’ food so much after having tasted it at a business meeting that I decided to go with them for a corporate event, seeing as I was in charge of finding the caterers. It is almost not worth it with what I have had to go through to get it. The lady in charge Alison is not business professional. I had to do two meetings with her about the menu because she did not remember or write anything down the first time I had met with her and after I did meet with her the second time it took her almost a month and a half to get back to me about how much everything would cost. Also, when she does say she is going to get a hold of me she never does, and every time I have to call and excuses are made to why she did not contact me. I am not pleased with the way things are handled and will not be catering through them again."
413,3,"Their customer service is horrible. I just finished speaking to a woman named Angela with Champion Foods to complain about all four of my animals getting sick from their food. Specifically, it was to complain about the amount of chondroitin and glucosamine that they put in the food, around 700 and 900 milligrams for a cup of food. The company recommends up to 1 1/2 cups of food for dogs my size (they are around 17 to 24 pounds), but every time I feed them more than 3/4 of a cup, they vomit all over my house. Moreover, one of my dogs was on Dasuquin w/ MSM when I purchased the food, and after I gave her 1/4 of a cup, she vomited. That prompted me to look at the back of the bag to see if anything was triggering the vomiting. So when I spoke to Angela, she expressed blithe concern about the problem. She stated the amount the food is minimal, which it isn't, otherwise, the dogs wouldn't throw up. Moreover, she stated the company isn't concerned about the issue. Then, she repeatedly spoke over me and used a condescending, sarcastic tone. Really? That how they train their employees to handle customer complaints? I've also complained to Chewy.com, the merchant that I purchased the food from, but the company states they do not have the financial resources to list this type of information out on their website. Be assured that I am filing a complaint against ACANA Dog and Cat Food with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration today, because it is irresponsible not to clearly mark the front of the bag or to have the merchant list the contents on their website if they are receiving reports of animals getting sick. Moreover, when I tried to complain about the incident on Acana's Facebook page, they have blocked my ability to post messages. Says volumes about their company."

415,1,"In January of 2003 I ate my usual lunch of a chicken sandwich at Wendy's. The next day I became violently ill and was admitted to the hospital. I was there for an entire week. After numerous tests were performed, it was determined that I had contracted Salmonella poisoning from some chicken I had consumed. Considering that the only chicken I ate had come from Wendy's I wrote the headquarters a letter stating what had happened to me so that they could check out the restaurant that had given me the bad food. I didn’t ask for anything other than to have them investigate this restaurant. I received a letter asking for clarification of events, such as the exact date, time, and order. I provided them with these details in writing and since then, I have heard absolutely NOTHING from them. I don’t know if they actually checked the restaurant out, if any other people suffered from poisoning like I did, ZIP. I haven’t eaten at any of their restaurants since then, being too afraid to eat there, since there was no follow up. The restaurant in question is in not such a great area and is usually not the cleanest inside, which is why I always had gone thru the drive thru or got my food to go. I can’t imagine that it is any cleaner or that the morons that work there give a flying flute about how they cook the food, or if it's cooked at all. I wouldn't recommend anyone eating at this particular Wendy's establishment. Actually, since the headquarters didn’t even apologize for causing me a week of agony and pain, I wouldn’t recommend eating at ANY Wendy's establishment."

Then she offered some type of Metabolism boost pills for $1.00 for the first bottle and then add to bottles would cost more. I said no thank you I am already taking diet pills. Show offered speedy delivery for an extra cost, I said no thank you. I thought she placed the order for what I agreed to. I got the order super fast, and I got a bottle of pills, and 50.00 was charged to my card. I called to say that I did not request this, and wanted to be credited, they said I did request it and could not get credit. I reported this to the BBB and the Fodd Lovers Company told them that they listed to the call and that I requested the pills. I did not! How do you win? I cancelled my card to prevent any more autopayments. Now they are threatening collections for the remaining bill.

418,1,Aladdin Food Management Services is the WORST company to work for. They have no respect for their employees and don’t value anyone. At one of their facilities located at the Lancaster Bible College they allowed their Chef sexually to harass their employees both on the management team as well as the employees beneath him. This Chef was never reprimanded for his actions and continues to work there.  The Food Service Director has never taken the appropriate action to take care of this situation resulting in it being considered a hostel environment. They also lost several employees due to this mismanagement. They have also hired a child sexual predator to work at their facility without conducting the proper screening. This company is all about saving their own ass and their bottom line. I guess you could say it is an old fashioned good old boys club What I need to ask is what in the hell is wrong with this company and why would anyone want them working for them???? If you are looking for a food management company I would highly recommend you not go with this company unless you want endless headaches and never ending frustration.
419,1,"I purchased the pork chops (thin cut) which were on sale this week and assumed (wrongly) that the sale price would ring up.  When I checked my receipt outside the store I realized it hadn't.  I went back inside and the clerk/manager said whoops, the guy who fixes the prices didn't come in so some of the incorrect prices are ringing up wrong.  I got the difference, but how many other customers believed Albertson's was going to be accurate in their pricing and got ripped off. And for only the guy to fix the prices?  Who are they kidding?  Is this just a ploy to get some extra income for the store or is it sloppy programming on their part.  How many other stores had the same problem?  Was this an issue statewide? This is the second time in several months that I caught Albertson's being sloppy in their pricing and ripping people off.  It's never so much that it's worth a trip back to the store and I'm sure the management is happy with that.  And they definitely don't offer to give you the item free anymore (or a big discount for catching their errors).  There are probably so many of them, they'd go broke. Shame Albertsons!  I guess I'm going back to Vons where I don't have this sort of problem (and the prices are cheaper)."
420,1,"I visited the Krystals in Troy on January 11, 2013 at 1:30 a.m. it was a black male who took my order.  My order total was $5.33, and I gave him $10.35, he handed me back two pennies and a receipt. I blowed my horn to get his attention to let him know I did not receive my $5.00 bill back but he turned the corner. So when he came back to give me my food, I let him know that I did not receive my $5.00 He got defensive and said, I did give it back to you. We looked on the ground and everywhere but nowhere was my $5.00 bill. The manager asked me to pull up so she could count the draw. After a few minutes she came out and apologized and said that they did not find any overage in his drawer. The manager I want to state is a very nice lady whom I have known for many, many years. However, her not finding the money came as no surprise to me because the 5.00 is in his pocket. Krystal has a thief working for them and I will let everyone I can think of, know about this so they will not have their money stolen from them as well. I have worked at the same job for over 10 years, and I deal with major money each day. Never have I had any shortage or any type of wrong doing with the company money. It is a shame that this guy stole $5.00 from me and acted like I was the criminal. I seriously believed that Krystal need to look into this guy background, because I am sure it is some questionable items there. This is a bad look for your company. Krystal is across from my work place so I eat there from time to time, but NEVER again. I work hard for my money, and it is not right to have it took away from someone who steals and treat the customer like they are in the wrong. If this guy got away with stealing from me then he probably has stolen from many, many more people. I will let all my family, friends, co-workers, business associates, church members, neighbors, and social media followers know... if you do not want your money stolen do not go to Krystal in Troy, Alabama... I repeat DO NOT go to Krystals in Troy, Alabama."

After 21 days of reviewing and trying the diet, I found it really did nothing for me.  I contacted the company to ascertain IF there was a return time frame, as the television ad stated.  I was told, like several others who have filed complaints here, that I was to wait till just before the payments were complete to return the package.  I explained that I knew at that time that the diet wasn’t working for me and would like to return it now. They stated that I needed to keep the diet system AT LEAST 90 days before I could return the materials.  After 90 days, I called for a return sticker and was told that I had waited too long to return the merchandise.  I asked if they had any record of my previous phone call and they said no.  I told them what had been said to me about the time frame.  The person, a male, got EXTREMELY rude with me and told me no one would have said such a thing and all I had to do was look at my materials.  I told him there was no information in my box so I called at the 21 day mark because there was no information to state the return date.  He told me that was not true, that all packages go out with that information.  After much arguing back and forth, the 'dude' told me that they WERE NOT refunding a dime of my purchase, that people like me who lie don't deserve a thing.  I asked for his supervisor and he hung up on me.  I called back, asked for a supervisor, was told no one was available at that time and the person took my name and phone number.  Of course, I did not receive a call back... even after I called and left 3 MORE MESSAGES!   THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM, IN MY OPINION!  THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND ANY GUARANTEES AND SHOULD BE CLOSED DOWN COMPLETELY!!!"

424,2,"The Checkers in North Babylon had the worst service I've seen ever in a fast food joint!! First, My brother and I went inside, because the drive-thru was too long. We waited on line for 10 minutes, but i finally got up to the cashier! Ordered my food and received my receipt. It was #94!! Now, i wait another 10 minutes just for my food to come out. NO FOOD! My brother got his order, and some people behind me got theirs. The order # that the cahier was up to was #11 (it goes from 99 back to 01) and still #94 was not out! I was there for over a half hour waiting (I am a patient person). Starting to get aggravated, I peeked into the kitchen and tried to get someone's attention. They were going at their own pace and ignored me. Even when i got the attention of 3 people, they refused to help me, cause they claimed to be too busy (too busy to help a customer? HAHAHA) When one guy finally came up to me, he didn't speak any English. He said that he would go look for my order! He never came back!!! So i cut in front of this lady (she understood my situation) and i got into the face of the cashier and demand my money back! The lady at the cashier looked at me, and laughed! I TOLD HER THAT MY ORDER HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN TO ME, I'VE WASTED MY LUNCH HOUR, AND I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! She refused!!! She then offered to go look for my lost order. She finally found it (after almost 45 minutes from ordering it)!! The bag with #94 on it, was all greased up, and nasty looking. Apparently, it was sitting on their counter for 30 minutes, and no one gave a Shit to give it to me!!! For the inconvenience, she offered me a free soda. It was still not worth the aggravation and time I lost, in addition to $6.50 and a cold lunch! All the workers there have their priorities set wrong!!! When you need their attention, they ignore you on purpose! THATS BAD SERVICE!! I will never go to the North Babylon Checkers Again!!!!"
425,3,"I frequently buying grocery products at Piazza's Fine Food. Last week there was a mistake where a product I bought and the price on the shelf was lower than the price the cash register charged me. I noticed it and they returned my money. Today (3-12-2006) I bought 12 items. I noticed at the cash register that Stoneridge Dried Strawberries were charged $6.49 instead of $4.59 (the price on the shelf was clear and appeared several times!) They apologized and returned the money. At home I checked again the invoice and found that they charged me $9.29 for Star X Olive Oil. I drove back to the store to find out that it should have been $7.98, clearly marked on the shelf. They apologized again and refunded me. They either cheat or very sloppy, and errors were always for their side. There should be a way they will be stopped. What about other people who are less aware than me? I was buying there over 7 years - how much money they ripped off me in the past? I'm not looking for ANY compensations. Just do something."
426,1,"I want to report about a merchant that simply steels money without selling products. Their site is desireclothing.co.uk They Lie about everything from the very beginning. I've made my order on 19 of May and was told that a month is a maximum period the parcel will be shipping to me. Almost three months past and I still have nothing. I've contacted their email support with that and their rep just said that by mistake they have send my parcel via ship but not plane. She asked to wait two weeks. The month is almost gone but nothing!!!All my requests after that were simply ignored. My searching have shown, that there are tons of customers with the problem like mine. And the reply about wrong shipping method is just a template. Don't buy from them. They are liers and cheaters. Money were simply gone!"
427,2,"In the middle of Septemeber 2013 we placed an order to express.com totaling approximately $232. $100 was applied using an express gift card, the remainder paid on credit card. The clothing arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but upon recieving the clothes it was apparent that nothing was going to fit. We repackaged the items and sent them all back for exchanges for a smaller size. I specifically requested the amount for any clothing that couldn't be exchanged be refunded to my card. At the beginning of October, I was notified that most of the clothing was no longer available, the clothing that could be exchanged totaled approximately $90. The remainder of the balance should have been a net $142. There is some slight return charge on your order which was less than $10. So lets call the net balance owed to me $132. Here is where things get very fishy. My account was refunded an incorrect $125, about $7 to $10 dollars short of the correct refund amount. But it only gets stranger from there. The next thing that occurred was a $90 charge on my credit card for the clothing they exhanged. Let me be clear. I paid $232 to express, the clothing that was kept by me in the end totaled $90 in value. The rest was returned. The difference owed to my account $142 minus $10 return charge. As I said a credit of $125 was added to my account (almost correct, just ~$10 short) and THEN express.com charged my account $90 dollar. They did this so that I would have an exact $100-dollar value which they then tried to send to me as a gift card instead of my requested cash refund. I am fully aware that if you pay with a gift card you will be refunded with that form of payment. But the clothing i kept ($90 worth) accounts for 90% of the gift card. The money should have been refunded into my bank account. WHICH IT WAS. They then removed funds fraudulently from my account, essentially ordering a $100 gift card without my permission. KEEP IN MIND I SPENT MY GIFT CARD. I kept $90 in clothes. A ten dollar refund to my gift card would be one thing. It appeared that they were going to do that when I received the $125 dollar credit to my bank account. When express.com charged my account $90 (two days after i received the $125 credit) and then attempted to send me a gift card, it was underhanded, slimy, and borderline fraudulent. When I asked why this happened I was told it was their policy to refund the first form of payment. I asked the express.com representative (a supervisor at this pont) if they were aware of any online store that didn’t first require you apply the gift card and then pay the remaining balance, including express.com. There isn't of course, that’s just not how these online payment forms work. To make it simple, the express.com policy on an order where a gift card is applied, is to refund the gift card first instead of the money you paid out of pocket. A terrible business practice that was obviously created so they could keep your money obligated to their Express Stores. In short, the paragraph before this one IS NOT what happened. They sent the exchange on Friday (notified me of shipment) and issued a (slightly incorrect by $10) refund on the next day. On Monday three days after I was notified of the exchange shipment, express.com charged my account $90 and attempted to send me a gift card that I didn't authorize. They USED my account FREUDULENTLY to purchase a gift card to send me in place of a cash refund I requested and deserved. What if I had been short money on bills that automatically withdraw from my account? I wil NEVER shop here again."
428,1,"Placed an order with Pinup Girl Clothing online and clothing was way too small. Tried to contact for a return authorization but their phone numbers are no good. Chat doesn't work. Email generates auto response. No address listed.  FINALLY, overnighted item back to them... (your order must be returned within 7 days of payment... never mind that you might not get the item that quickly). Received an email with a credit memo and no clue as to how to use it but no credit in my bank account. Contacted BBB to try to obtain my money back... THIS COMPANY IS NOT BBB ACCREDITED!!!"
429,1, I ordered a few items in October. Paid extra for rush delivery. Needless to say nothing arrived on time. There are three months of $14.95 charges to my credit card. I've sent three emails for which I received case #s but no further information i.e. Credit. I contacted my credit card company this morning to dispute these charges. I hope a lawyer takes this company on in a class action lawsuit as they seem to be ripping everyone off. How many illegal charges have gone unnoticed? What is Pyramid VIP anyway? No information available on that either. Thieves. Horrible customer service. Can't dislike them enough.
430,1,"I ordered 3 items from pinup girl clothing and only received 2, i was charged for an item that was not in stock and therefore not shipped to me and had to contact them for a refund. I checked my bank statement days later only to find i was only refunded $19 for a $23 dress... the second item i returned for a different size which has yet to come...i mean it's only been two months right?!after contacting them repeatedly by email, once by phone (left a message which wasn't returned) and using the live chat thing (two weeks ago) was told it would be investigated and i would be emailed (insert crickets chirping) so i'm still out $44 dollars...my next step is to call my bank and see if they can help me out because they have once before in a similar situation (thanks USAA!)there's a good reason why they have a horrible rating with the BBB come to find out, their customer support sucks and I’ll never buy anything from them again and i intend on telling my friends not to also via Facebook so the word gets around!"
431,1,"I sent an email to inquire about an item prior to ordering from Fairy Princess Clothing.  After not recieving a response, I ordered the item anyway.  My Visa card was charged for the item and 1 week later was charged again for the same item.  I emailed the company informing the owner Katrina Michaels about the 2nd unauthorized charge on my Visa and I did get a response from her stating she will look into it.  That is the last time I heard from her.  I have received no answers for my follow up emails and had to get my bank involved to attempt a chargeback.  My bank tells me they have tried to contact her by phone and by email and her company phone is a changed number recording that directs you to another phone number that is some other unrelated business.  She never returned my banks emails.  1 month has passed... It is very clear that Katrina Michaels and www.FairyPrincessClothing.com is fraudelant and will be reported again to the Better Business Bureau.  This company has a history of poor business practices and now fraudelant activity involving credit card transactions.  Fairy Princess Clothing has no intention of refunding my money, just a straight forward robbery.  Do not do business with this shady internet company."
432,2,"Unbelievable!! I went to a Divine Molestee show at my neighbor's house (having never done this before I was new to this type of business). They didn't have a lot of swimsuit sizes to try on so you had to make a guess at which size would fit you. I placed my order in the middle of April (2007) and the consultant said the orders should be in by May 1st. 6 weeks later no swimming suit and no news from the company. At around 7 weeks I was attempting to call and call and no one called me back. I finally received the bottoms to the suit at about 7 1/2 weeks out. They didn't fit right. At about 8 weeks I received my top which also didn't fit. By this time I just wanted my money back (having heard they were out of the sizes I would need). I made contact with the consultant who told me I could return it and be refunded my money. She told me what form to fill out, what to send and where to send it. I sent it back the beginning of June. Here it is the middle of July and they still have my money and my swimsuit. I just phoned the owner who was completely rude and she replied We don't refund for swimming suits. I had never been told this policy. She continued to place blame on the consultant and never took responsibility for any of this mess. Imagine the owner?? I have never been treated so poorly and been so openly ripped off and lied to."
433,1,"I know before I ordered that company was called Rachel Outlets but at the time I ordered, it was called Lowest Priced Clothing. Either wasy, Beware. I placed order with these people on their online website. Processed to pay via e-check. the next day i called so i would know how much for shipping and I was told. Then i asked when i should expect shipping and they said 2 weeks. I asked why so long and they said cause of my payment choice. I asked them if I pay via wire when will I get shipment and they said they would ship the next day...WELL THAT WAS A LIE. I wired them 522.00 (changed order from what was on website) and was assured that the e-check would be cancelled....WELL THAT WAS I LIE TOO!!! NOT ONLY DID IT TAKE OVER A MONTH TO GET MY SHIPMENT, IT CAME IN VERY POOR PACKAGING. THE BOXES WAS WIDE OPEN FOR ANYBODY TO REACH IN AND TAKE OUT GOODS...WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED!!! They wind up sending me my first order which they took out 439.00 and not the changed order. After 3 months of contacting them and trying to get my money back, I told them to just send me the equivalent in clothes and I told them what i wanted in equivalent AND THEY DID SHIP ME CLOTHES but nothing i wanted!!! buyers beware. This company is VERY slow to ship ..if they ship at all. when you get your shipment, the packaging will be poor and the sizes of the clothes are mostly small or medium sizes. If they owe you money they will not pay and give you run around. They have very poor business ethics."
434,1,"My first impression of Newport News was: Wow they have really good deals for clothing and shoes! I can't wait to order some cute and cheap things here. November 13, 2007 I was browsing around to purchase an affordable outfit for a company holiday party (December 1st) because it's not that serious and I don't need to be buying anything expensive to wear mingling around with employees. I found something that day and was invoiced the next day and was out for ground delivery which should only take about 3-5 business days or sooner hello I ship out things daily so I know how that crap works. I waited and waited until I didn't receive anything on November 23rd, I looked up my account and order status WTF, my order wasn't ship because the item was out of stock! How can that be when I clicked on that item and the quantity I wanted and checked out with it, be out of stock?! Clearly that's false advertising not to mention I didn't even get an email saying that the item was unavailable but charged my credit card! I called and asked if I can get a similar item for the same price I tried to purchase the first time for going through the troubles or free delivery to come before December 1st. I ended up ordering something else and paid $20 more than what I wanted to pay. Unfortunately, Newport News Customer service couldn't do anything but say sorry for the inconvenience we'll do better next time to improve our services what BS is that?! Even though I ordered something else it didn't get to me before the party I had to go out and buy a dress the day before. What a waist of time and money. The day is December 26, 2007 I finally received the outfit I ordered last month at least I got it before the new year. Makes me think twice before ordering from some crap online store. I get things on Ebay faster than this outside the U.S. So, people don't waist your time with NEWPORT NEWS THEY SUCK!!! I Am a very unhappy customer with them."
435,1,"I sent this company $37.98 and I (among others I see) were promised items that we never received. I've tried so many times to get my money back. I've tried emailing, calling, etc. NOTHING. I found an ad in craigslist for a part time print modeling job and I answered it. I have a full time job, but my son's father was killed in an auto accident, therefore leaving me with a lot of financial responsibility. I saw their fake ad and believed it and answered. THEY responded to my photos and sent me an email expressing interest and told me to buy a shirt. So I did with hopes of getting a potential second line of income. To my surprise! THEY scammed me. I can't believe people/businesses like this still exist in this world. I'm 110% dedicated to making sure that EVERYONE I know (including television stations, radio stations, media) finds out EXACTLY what this company did to me. If they did this to me, a struggling young widow/mom, then I know they will do this to others in worse situations. Shame, Shame, Shame on you! "
436,1,"This is the worst company I have came across in a very long time. I dont understand how they're even still open?  I placed an order with them in Febuary 2013. I never received the items, I realized I didnt get my clothes in October 2013 so I started calling them to figure out what had happened. I was told they would re-ship it out to me. Of course I didnt get anything this time either. This went on for 3 months. Every time I called I would be told they didnt know what happened and they would make sure it shipped out that day. Finally I spoke to a manager and he said he would personally make sure it shipped and that I would get a refund check as well for my trouble. Still havent received either and the sales people will not let me speak to a manger anymore or any body higher up for that matter. They lie about everything and they won’t refund your money. I started emailing them and trying to get a hold of them any way I could but this company is truly the worst. I started reading some of the reviews and realized that every single comment is just like my situation. I told them that I'm turning them into the Better Business Bureau but after looking on there I saw they already had 43 reports. I hope people see this and do not purchase anything from them."
437,2," I ordered a pair of boots from Star Clothing Store (website: ellesoppings.com) because I found them to have very high quality products at very reasonable prices.  After reviewing the website and the provided shipping information, I knew that it might take anywhere from 7-20 days for my boots to arrive, as some items are shipped from a warehouse in the United States while others are shipped from another warehouse overseas.  Before I knew it, three weeks had passed and I still had not received my boots.  I reviewed the website information again, and didn't think much of it yet because I figured maybe they were coming from the overseas warehouse.  However, when more than a month had passed and still no boots, and no response to my email (sent to Tim Tointon @ the email address listed on the website), I filed a complaint with PayPal.  Thankfully I had paid for my boots via PayPal, because although it took approximately 3-4 weeks, I did receive a full refund...but still no response from Tim Tointon of Star Clothing Store.  If I had not used PayPal, I honestly do not believe I would have gotten my money back.  There's something very suspicious about this website.  I will NOT be placing any additional orders with them, although I found many pairs of shoes I would like to order. Lastly, I have been monitoring the Star Clothing Store website for a month now, and have realized that their stock of items is never depleted.  They seem to have every imaginable size of shoes and clothes, at all times...probably because they don't actually have the items to sell!  Finally, today, I believe the website has been taken down or someone found out they aren't real.  I have tried to go to the website off and on throughout the day so far, and get an error every time.  Hopefully they have been put out of business!"
438,2,"I placed an order with this company on March 23rd. The website says that it takes 1-3 business days to process the order, yet when I contacted them 5 days later (via LiveChat) I got the run around on when this would be shipped and had to rephrase my question at least 4 times before I got an answer from the representative. She said that it would be shipped by 8am the following morning. I was a little irritated that it was taking so long just to leave their warehouse but decided to let it slide. 2 days later I received an email saying that one of the items that I had ordered was unavailable and that I would be receiving a credit for this item (which I still have not received) about 10 minutes later I finally received my tracking number which gave me the impression that since they weren't able to supply all the items that I had ordered they shipped it then as quickly as possible to prevent me being able to cancel the order. I FINALLY receive my order on April 8th and the jacket that I had ordered was damaged. GREAT! I contacted them again via LiveChat and was told that they could give me 10% off or I could return the item and hope that they had another one available. I told her that I would keep the item if I could receive more of a credit than that, but that 10% was not enough for me to keep a white sleeved jacket that had spots up and down both arms. She said that if I sent pictures then I would receive 10% plus a refund on my shipping amount. I decided to settle for that rather than deal with returning the item. I emailed pictures of the marks on the jacket and was told that someone would contact me about this within 20 minutes of receiving the pictures. (Shocker... no one called) I called today April 9th and was told that the last person that I had spoken with was not in today (which seems to be a common answer with them judging by reviews) and was told that I could only receive 10% and $5 off my shipping since not everything in the package was damaged. I tried to be patient with the customer service rep, I have worked for an online company before so didn't want to be rude, but after she raised her voice at me on the phone I told her to go ahead and send me the shipping label since I would most definitely be returning the item... and I think it goes without saying that I WILL NOT EVER order from this company again."

441,1,I became a Magic Kids retailer and was selling on Ebay for over a year.  Last Sept they slacked off on their expedited shipping and have cut their days from 5-4 and hours from 9-2:30. They used to open 5 days and hours from 9-5.  All of a sudden i could not log onto their website mklossleder.com.  I tried getting on today and the website has been disabled along with their phone as you can’t get a hold of a person to talk with or leave a message. I paid for a membership plus business cards and never saw any profit returned to me.  I should have known something was wrong when they started cutting their hours and days open and the lousy service.  STAY AWAY FROM THEM!!!!!!!!

I came across these guys on the Internet and they sounded very professional and exactly what I wanted for my business.   THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM I was very sceptical to pay full price over Western Union as they did not accept payment via pay pal or bank transfer. Weird. Anyway, soon as I paid £25000 for a sample and bulk it's like they didn't want to know me. I called and called and sent emails which were completely ignored. I wrote complaints etc. They advised me that there were various holidays in United Kingdom which has meant they couldn't send anything. 6 months now still chasing for my samples and a financial loss of £25000.   THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM AVOIDE THIS COMPANY."

I got a store credit because I was tired of them trying to fix their mess (I mean mistake). I tried to use my store credit and it didn't work. I had to email back and fourth several times to get the code to work (finally). Placed an order using my store credit and it took MONTHS (4) to receive my order. When I finally received my order the items did not fit (AGAIN) and I was missing items in my order. For as much as she charges the clothes should be of better quality, on time, and to the specified measurements. My experience was awful and now I understand why they only offer store credit. Maybe my experience would have been different if I had thousands of followers on Instagram or actually went into the store make my purchases. I wish I would have read the reviews before placing an almost $500 order. Please save yourself the trouble."
446,1,"Rude Boy Clothing store was a place we've respected over the last 30 years. I have bought at least 50 dresses there in my life, as well as decor for my apartment and linens for most of my occasions and parties. The original owner Quis, a hard worker who came from Africa was always kind and willing to help it's customers being it was the only small shop in our small community. Now they have a new staff, and no one knows how to treat the customers. They don't care about the Rude Boy clothing shop like they are supposed to. The Rude Boy Clothing Store is not what it seems now. They are shut down for a reason. The workers there are obviously OTT and lack proper manners. They are ran by some random Arabs or middle eastern looking people. I have not seen before. They obviously bought the location over. They have poor dresses and poor accessories. Their magazine selections have gone down to zero, and they are itching for every penny before they closed down! I used to grab all the issues of XXL, The Source, and they had almost every music magazine there was. Now the Rude Boy magazine rack is full of garbage and old issues of crap. It's as if they haven't updated their stock for years. The uphold of the facility has also gone down. Things used to be clean and organized. Now it seems like they haven't dusted the place for years and having it rust down! This place is a mess, ran by a mess or shady people! I got three carribean style dresses or my mom last week before they shut their door, each one was $50 plus tax, all three of them were defected. One of them, had pockets that were sown in closed, when it wasn't supposed to be. It was the SAME DAY that I wanted to return the dresses. I went back literally within an hour, and they said NO REFUNDS! I paid with my card, so it was even harder for them. They dragged me back and fourth trying to do this and that. Then they finally came clean and said, sorry we don't do refunds. They simply could have just did a charge back to my card, but they insisted that we get store credit. But, I didn't want the credit because two of the dresses where the last ones! These guys are so shady, and literally did not give a flying crap about my satisfaction. I will never shop at the Rude Boy Clothing store again, and I don't know who the new owner is, but this location is doomed for good. I'm not the only person who cannot stand these new owners. They have turned something good into something lower than crap. Stay away!"
447,2,"I ordered several outfits from SammyDress.com.  When I got them, they were about 5 sizes too small (they looked like little girls' clothes).  One of the outfits was partially sewn inside out.  A pair of leggings had a large hole in it (and, it didn't have any tags on it).  I attempted to contact the company multiple times, but several of the phone numbers didn't work.  The one for China (yes, an international call) didn't turn up anyone.  No one called me back.  I sent several messages that went unreturned.  And, I tried the 24/7 chat feature on their website that always said it was offline or unavailable, no matter the day or time of day. I contacted the Better Business Bureau.  SammyDress.com e-mailed me through their website asking for all kinds of pictures of the merchandise with tape measures, original packaging, certain types of lighting, etc. to make sure they didn't send the wrong items.  They said if they determine that it was their mistake, then they would issue a refund.  I just want to return all of the merchandise (over $100 of merchandise plus an extra $50 for shipping!) and get a full refund.  If SammyDress.com does not do this, I will be taking legal action against them."
448,1,"This company is a scam!  I bought 3 items from them, they look nothing like the pictures on their website.  They are beyond cheap, couldn't be the same clothing as on their pictures.  One of the items, a sweater came with a huge hole in the back.  Their website claims to have a 30 day return warranty to give customers peace of mind it says.  However, you must email them your reason for return and attach pictures first.  I did so and after a couple emails they told me that they could give me a $5 compensation and maybe I could sell the items.  Or I could return the items if I pay shipping back to China and then when they get them, they will give me a refund.  However, after reading others' complaints about the company, I highly doubt they will refund my money even if I do pay to ship the items back and I will just end up losing the cost of the shipping which is more money lost at this point.  This company is obviously a scam and fraudulent.  It has gorgeous pictures on their website that they know will appeal to American buyers, however the actual clothes are completely cheap and don't look anything like the pictures.  And they have no intentions of refunding anyone's money for dissatisfaction or even damaged merchandise."
449,1,"Do NOT buy from Popjulia.  Their product images are great.  What they ship you is garbage.  They ship from China - their orders take over a month to arrive.  Once they arrive, the sizes are WAY off.  What I received did NOT match the measurements of what they print on their site.  The fabrics on their site are high quality, flowing and beautiful.  What they ship is cheap, stiff polyester junk.  Also, the cut of the dresses/blouses on their site shows flowing volumes of fabric.  What they shipped me is anywhere to 30% to 40% less volume at the hems.  The skirts are not as long either.  In other words, what they ship you only vaguely resembles what they advertise. When you want to return the garments, they suggest you give it to charity as the shipping will cost you more than the garment.  I returned the garments (another $30) via the US Postal Service.  They claimed not to have received it.  I included the invoice in the package as reference.  They wanted me to ship it via DHL, UPS, or Fed Ex, which would have cost about $80.  So they kept my $100 and kept the garments I returned to them.  Note that they sent me the garments via snail-mail without delivery confirmation. Their product is junk, and their business model is make the return so expensive that their customers eat the bad garments they send.  This company advertises everywhere - I am surprised there aren't more complaints.  The postal worker I spoke with when I was returning the garbage clothing to Popjulia told me that she sees a lot of returns to that company.  AVOID Popjulia!"
450,1,"This company has bad policies for returning items. They say that you can exchange anything in the store, but no returns. Okay. I bought a sweater for my sis in law on 12/21/10 and when I got home to show it to my husband, he noticed that the hem was very discolored. I immediately returned the next morning with the receipt and original bag to exchange the sweater for an undamaged one. Pretty normal stuff, right? To my surprise, the clerk, who remembered me from the previous day, balked...saying that she personally checks ALL THE CLOTHING before they are put out on the sales floor and she would NEVER put something out that was damaged. I was laughing, like WHAT? I made a fuss, so she called some manager person who wasn't on site, and couldn't get a hold of her... She said she was ""in the shower""...I was getting furious. I waited around the store for 30 minutes trying to get an exchange!!! No luck. So eventually I left in a huff, leaving the sweater, taking my receipt to call the credit card company. NOW GET THIS. THIS IS THE SCAM.THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY WILL REMOVE THE CHARGE, BUT THE STORE GETS PAID ANYWAY! FOR SOME REASON, AN ""IN STORE"" DISPUTE GETS PAID BY THE CARD. This is how and why the store operates this way. I WANT THEM OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD MALL. Ill will and bad business practices abound in this place.!!"
451,2,"I went to Baxter's with my boyfriend about one month ago. I got a very bad experience about this restaurant. This is my 3rd time in this restaurant and it will be my last time. First of all, we went to the non smoking area but we saw a lady who sit next to us smoking a cigarette and the waiter or waitress did not do anything about this. We asked the waitress to move to the smoking area which was empty. I ordered the steak (I forgot the name) and I wanted it medium, but it came out in well done. The steak was cold, the vegetable had no taste and cold. The waitress didn't appear after she took the food to us. I left without saying anything and I won't go there again."
452,3,"Hi, dear who may it concern I, as a consumer who do not wish to state full name for confidential reason for my girlfriend have been threatened by this company. The name of company is Takamatsu Restaurant in Phoenix,AZ. On December 12, she went to that restaurant with some of her collegues from her school, it was her reunion party from A.S.U. They were wearing sandals, tank-tops, and shorts as we enter the restaurant. They were confronted by a man who seemed to be an owner. He told her that they cannot be in that restaurant with such appearance, however, my girlfriend and I had been patronizing that restaurant for more then a year. I haven't seen such sign or restriction regarding attires. I, myself occationally went to that restaurant with my girlfrend with casual dress with tank top and sandals. My girlfriend (who i don't wanna divulge her name since she has been threatened), complained to the manager. Suddenly, the man yelled at her the all table is reserved, and there is no rooms for you guys. He also noticed that a guy sitting on the susie bar stool wearing tank top and sandals. so she pointed at him saying how about him? he told her that he was his son. She didn't want her collegues to be disappointed for she was buying them a dinner. So She complained that she and her friend haven't had time to change their dress after playing tennis and she also said that the company should put a dress code sign on the door. The man called some of the waiters, and she was also confronted by waiters, some of them were cracking there nuckles. She didn't want to confront them and spoil her school reunion's mood. She was threatened my the manager, and his employees and she was prejudiced by his drunkenness and without any visible restriction on dress codes."
453,1,"The restaurant has the worst customer service on the planet earth. In fact, the waitresses and bartenders are so rude, they act as if you, the client, are impositioning them by being there and buying food and liquor. The staff is the rudest I have ever experienced in the restaurant industry. In fact, I worked in the food industry for 20 years and never have been treated so badly when I spent so much money for crappy service. All the customers say the same thing. They hate the service but the location is fabulous. The management seems to care, but the management do not run the place, the bartenders and the waitresses run the place. They treat the customers like crap. My last visit there, someone put baby laxative in my food and drink, I got so sick I went to the hospital. What a joke. The staff need to STOP running their business and the management needs to start paying attention to what the staff is doing to drive customers away. I love the food and I hate the female servers they are so rude to everyone there. Why don't they hire male bartenders? Now that is prejudice. And why do they have a bunch of hormonal, rude, women running their restaurant when they don't care? One bartender should not ignore any customer. I go there because the food is great. Now, because of the servers, and the food poisoning, I can't go back. They should be sued. "
454,1,Lua bartenders were required to buy 2 disgusting uniform shirts from a local taylor in Hoboken named Hollydae. Although many of the employees told the owner that these shirts were horrific they were still told to buy them. These shirts were $75.00 a piece and were worn once before the owner banished them from the bar! Not one bartender has seen a penny of reimbursement and is treated like garbage when questioning management. This place is shady through and through. If you treat your staff like garbage the end result of the Restaurant is garbage. 
455,3,"This is a complaint for the Noblesville, IN restaurant we ate at on 1/21/08. We had horrible service. We sat down at 5:30pm. We were not served our food until 7:15pm. One hour and 45 minutes later? I even had to get our own drink refills multiple times. Once we had our food, it was not done correctly but we were afraid to send it back due to time constraints. For example, my wife ordered cheesy broccoli soup. She commented that it was dipped and set out awhile because the top layer of cheese was not melty. It had formed at the top. My steak was over done. I ordered medium, but it came well done. No pink at all. My daughter ordered the kids pancakes with sprinkles. There were no sprinkles. I had to ask for a steak knife and my rolls. When we were able to talk to the manager, her response was that we have a new waitress, and this is her first time. It was not crowded so she should have been fine. I assume that you train them before hand? We were also told that the average wait time is 12 minutes for food. We waited 105 minutes. That is 8.75 times longer than the average. If the average is 12 minutes, that would mean that some people would be getting their food in 60 seconds. We had my parents who had to get home and were delayed because of this. We have a son and daughter who had school the next day and since it was a very late dinner, they were extremely tired this morning. We also have a 3 month old baby that usually is in bed by 7PM. That did not happen, so we had a fussy newborn and an exhausted wife who took care of her. I read the Perkins Promise on the website. This restaurant failed the promise. It talks about every employee having the authority to ensure guest satisfaction. I did not see that. Why did the hostess not chip in and get drinks? Why did the manager not step up and either help with cooking or getting refills or even just taking orders? I truly can say that this was the worst dining experience I have ever had at any restaurant. I truly hope you are able to make things better. This location will not last if there are more experiences like mine."
456,1,"On May 10th I took my family to this restaurant. I was told on the phone to show up at 8:00pm because the belly dancer was going to start the show which it would last 45min. Because I wanted to see the show and try a new food I went there exactly at 8:00pm. The dancer never showed up and the waiter did not what was happening. So we ordered our food, which by the way was horrible. Nobody was able to eat the food as it tasted and smelled bad. I told the waiter one of the reasons for us to go there was because of the show, and he did not say anything back. Food was overpriced as we spent $150.00...at the end we were not able to see the show or eat a good food. I have tried to contact the restaurant for a refund at least partial since they had lied to us about the show. But the restaurant is not willing to fix the problem. The supervisor was very arrogant and could care less about their reputation. DO NOT go there is waste of money and time. They will advertise live music and belly dancers but is all lies.!"
457,3,"I feel it is my obligation to the community to let them know the kind of people that are now running Nick's.  Nick's has been open for over 40 years, but now this once wonderful restaurant is being run by the grand kids of the original owner Nick their grandfather.  Dominic Jr., the grandson is a poor example of a manager.  He walks around half asleep, completely uninterested in anything that resembles a true Italian Host.  Perhaps, he has a drug problem, because he surely looks lethargic at times, hiding in a tiny little office when he should be greeting guests, answering the phone, and acting like he cared a little.  He calls in sick, comes in late, basically doesn't care at all.  Nicky, the grand daughter, is the most horrible example of an unkept, lazy little girl (because thats how she acts totally immature) and will do or say any lie to get out of doing any real work.  This Nicky, is a complete and total slob (hair and clothing looks dirty), makes excuses to get out of real work, and eats like a complete pig the entire time she is on her shift.  These 2 children need to be fired immediately and a real management crew needs to be brought in to save this restaurant."
458,3,"The food is great, but the attitude of the bartender whose name is Windi is horrible. I visited Tortuga's on March 21, 2017 and was very disappointed in Windi the head bartenders’ attitude and offensive language. While, I was leaving she told me to go f$%k myself for no apparent reason. There were small children in close vicinity that unfortunately heard her derogatory statements/ outburst and even the children's parents were so offended by the repugnant comments made by Windi they left shortly after I did. This place has the potential to be a great bar, but an absolute horrible family environment. Hope this helps! "
459,1,"I was at Ike's in August 2011. The waitress brought me a platter that I did not even order worth over $40.00 that was meant for a large group of people. I was with my girlfriend at the time and mentioned that I did not order the platter. Instead of the waitress admitting she made a mistake on her ticket order, she played it off as if it was my fault, yelled at me several times even though I was acting calm, and told the manager I was a liar. The manager came over and told me that I had to pay for the platter since I ordered it even though I did not order it or he was going to call the police. He raised his voice several times at me and was threatening. This was my first time at Ike's in Sterling Heights and I will never go back there again. They are crooks and treat their customers with no respect. Do not support these people!"
460,1,"This is the WORST restaurant in Arlington Heights.  After ordering food, one of the entrees did not arrive until we were leaving.  The waiter apologized and said we would not be charged for the bill.  My uncle left a 40.00$ tip.  After arriving home the owner called our home screaming, and saying we walked out on the check. We returned to the restaurant immediately, apologized for the misunderstanding, and paid what he said we owed. As we were certainly not trying to get away with a free dining experience. We simply followed what the waiter had said, that the meal would be comped. The food we did receive was awful, and the service atrocious.  Please leave this one off your list. Definitely NOT worth your time or aggravation. "
461,1,"My wife, my daughter and I went to the Northgate, WA RAM restaurant on January 15, 2016 about 6:00 PM. Unfortunately, that restaurant was one of our worst experiences we ever had. I absolutely don’t recommend this place to any body. Here is why: The place was cold, we asked if they could change our table, they did but it was still cold. The server looked like hated his job, he wasn’t rude, but as you may imagine eating in a restaurant that the server hated his job and just wanted to get ride of customers was a pain.   I asked for a glass of wine. He brought wine but not in regular glass wine, but in a small cup! If you ever drank wine, you know when the wine is old, you get headache. The wine he brought me was old. Because that old bad wine, I got headache for the rest of the day. They charged me $9 for such a nasty wine! Those guys think people are stupid! I asked him; till our lunch is ready can we have some bread and butter or something like it, just like other restaurants. He brought some bread with no butter and charged me $3 for it. Those kinds of bread are free in other restaurants.   I asked the server why that place is so wired; she said that place is a sport fast food. But they charged me $10 for service!    We order two salads and I asked him to bring me their popular food but not sandwich. I told him that I hate eating sandwich in a restaurant. He brought a burger sandwich anyway! There was nothing especial about food, really nothing especial and just ordinary food that you can find everywhere.    After all those pain, they gave us the check that was about $70 for two salads, a burger and a glass of wine. As I said they charged me $10 as service.   That RAM restaurant was way overpriced. The food and service never ever worth even near the half of $70. I don’t recommend this place to anybody at all. Don’t go to that restaurant or whatever they call it. They rip off people and even worse, they think people are stupid. "
462,2," I jogged 3 miles from Navy Pier where I live to China Town this morning. I was hungry, went to Triple Crown Restaurant for some Dim Sum, I ordered ten different dishes all by myself, but I only had a taste or a little bit on each of them, also some Chinese tea along with the food. I felt a bit nauseous and a bit headache at first, didn't pay much attention since I considered might because I ran earlier... So I took all the leftover got an Uber home... once I got home, I had to vomited twice, headache worsened, felt stomach floating... that I knew I was sick from those food... I called my Doctor, drank water, felt terrible... When I tried to reach the restaurant about the issue, they had such a bad attitude that I didn't want to argue with them anymore. The manager there was very rude and ignorant..."
463,3,"Before relocating recently, I lived in RI where I would frequent the Wendy's in nearby N. Smithfield. They would frequently get the order incorrect, but nothing major and nothing that they would not fix IF I caught it before taking it home. This one particular time, I went through the drive-thru since I had my children in the car with me. After a less-than-friendly greeting and request for my order, I started giving my 5-item selection. After listing only 2 items, the voice at the other end of the speaker started to rattle on about something incoherent to me. I stopped giving my order and said Excuse me? and was told (rudely) that she was not talking to me and that she was listening, finish my order. I started over again, not truly convinced that someone having 2 conversations would be paying all that much attention to either, and was told with as much sass as I am sure that she could muster up, I am not deaf. You gave me those things already. Did you want something else or are you done? I was stunned to silence for a moment which prompted that sassy voice to again ask, Did you want something? I don't have all day! I told her that she could delete my order and that I would not be returning as I did not appreciate her tone. Now, before someone assumes that I was rude, I did say this firmly but professionally as I am in the company of my children. I rode around to exit the drive-thru and was greeted by the voice, now a person standing behind a bullet-proof window, with her middle finger extended to me in what I can only assume is her best attempt at a Goodbye. This branch of Wendy's is not listed in the phone book, so I called another branch manager (Lincoln, RI) that heard my story and was appalled. They stated that their branch was privately owned and that the troubled branch was corporate-owned. They graciously gave me the phone# for Corporate Headquarters and wished me luck. Before hanging up the phone, the privately owned branch offered me a few free meal coupons for my trouble as he felt bad for the service that I received at another branch carrying the same name! How nice! I called Corporate Headquarters and, after 2 failed attempts to locate a human being, was told by the secretary that I would need to speak with Chris and that he would call me back if I left him a message. Needless to say, I left 2 messages 2 days apart and never received any calls back. I had never gone back to the troubled Wendy's but decided to travel the extra miles and gave my business to the Wendy's in Lincoln up until I relocated!"
464,1,"In February of 2002, I became engaged to a woman whom I thought was the love of my life. I then proceeded to book a room for the reception at the Olde Barn Restaurant. I gave them a deposit of US$750 to secure the room for May 29, 2004. In Feb. of 2003, the love of my life changed her mind, and the wedding was off. Heart broken, I went to the restaurant asking for the deposit back, having noted that I gave them way over a years notice to fill that room. They assured me that when the room was filled, I would get my deposit back. Well, here it is, a year later, and less than a week to the day that I would have been married, and they tell me that the room is not booked, after all that time. They refuse to give me even a small part of that money back. Imagine, $750.00 just for the half hour it took them to show me the room and scribble my name in a book. They are hiding behind company policy while doing something that at best is greedy, and at worst, is downright WRONG! I will never dine there again, and if anyone knows what I can do to get that money back or smear their reputation, I would most sincerely appreciate it."
465,3,"I am an Indian US resident and love dining out. I have been to blue swan diner more than couple of times with family and friends time to time. Not only me, others also felt that the service is very poor to Indian. The same waitress serving others with a big smile on her face and asking how you doing etc? But not paying attention to us even we are asking for help. Today 09/15/02, I went for brunch with my family and had worst experience ever in my life. It was a clear declinational behaviour towards us. Story is like this ... There was confusing entry in the menu, When I asked the waitress about the missing item which was not served, She came after a quite a wait, and told us this what it is and I worked here for so many years. She didn't listen at all I was trying to tell that it is a confusion because of menu entry. Anyway we waited again for five minutes for the item, she didn't bring it. Finally, I have to asked again for this item. After paying, I just want tell about the service to manager, I was just talking to someone, meanwhile one old guy (may be owner) came with a red face (angry) and interrupt our conversation, ask the guy Let me handle him. When I saw his face, I told him it doesn't seems that you are going to listen. He kind of asked me to go out of the restaurant. I came out of the restaurant, I open the car for my kids, and I came back to take the visiting card of the restaurant. The Guy gave me the card, again the same old guy came and took the card from my hand force fully and asked me to go out of the restaurant. I could not resist myself to tell my feelings to him that It is a clear case of discrimination. I am looking forward to seeing, what Can you do against such a abusive, discriminative behavior? I will appreciate your help in this matter."
466,1,"Pepin restaurant in the heart of old town Scottsdale, Arizona is an establishment that blatantly adds items not ordered to the bill and refuses to listen to reason when confronted with complaints. A group of 14 people visited the Spanish restaurant complete with flaminco dancers, this past Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. The group was originally supposed to be 20 people, but after a few could not make it, 14 was the final number. After a couple hours of eating and drinking, the bill came...just shy of $700.00. After carefully inspecting the bill, it was determined that the party was charged for the additional 6 people included in the reservation EVEN THOUGH NO FOOD WAS ORDERED OR PREPARED FOR THOSE PEOPLE! When the manager was confronted with the extra meals that were added to the FOOD portion of the bill as one lump sum so as to hide the extra phony charges he said they have a policy that whatever your reservation is for, you are charged for that many meals. After explaining that this was a birthday and the night was being ruined by adding food to the bill, the manager agreed to take two of the meals off of the bill. This still left over $100.00 in extra food that was not order or prepared. In fact, the food that was added to the bill was not even offered to eat there or to take home. The manager was not swayed by the fact that the Better Business Bureau, untold numbers of friends and associates and internet sites would be told of this gouging. He said that was their policy, which was NEVER relayed on the phone or in person. His customer service came to an end when he stated that if we were angry and vowed to never return, there was nothing he could do about it. Do not frequent this establishment. It is a shady establishment at best that despite the acceptable food and entertainment, is not worth the headache when it comes time to settle the bill."
467,1,"My wife and I were on vacation in Nags Head, N.C. At 3:50 p.m. we decided to dine at the KFC restaurant there. After ordering our food, we went to be seated. We looked the dining area over to find a clean table but ended up wiping one off our selves. The seats were covered with crumbs of food also, so we had to wipe the seats too. While dining there were several young people, dressed in KFC uniforms sitting at nearby tables. They were having a rap session or something. You would not believe the vulgarities they were using in their conversations. Very, very ugly language. They paid us no attention. I thought to myself that colonel Sanders would roll over in his grave if he knew his employees were being so disrespectful while customers were dining. I got a complaint form from the counter but decided to not leave it, knowing it would only be trash canned after we left. This restaurant is a disgrace to the KFC chain and the town of Nags Head, N.C."
468,1,I was referred to Tomo by a mutual customer to assist them in getting their point of sale system back up and running after a computer failure. They had no way to run their tickets to serve dinner and the needed an emergency response call. I am a computer/network specialist with my own business serving small businesses in the greater Knoxville area. I arrived on scene to find that they had blown the motherboard in their main PC due to shorting out their primary parallel printer cable repeatedly. Within 3 hours I had located a similar Pc and migrated their POS software (which they had a pirated copy and not payed for... should have known) over to the new PC and had it up and working including installing all of their printer drivers (aside from the one with the short) correctly. I even stayed close by for the dinner rush in case they needed me. I billed them for the new (used) PC and the time that I spent working (not being on call) and they never paid me or even acknowledged my bills. I gave up even trying after 6 months of non-response and trying to leave them messages at the restaurant. If you are a small service business and you don’t want to be ripped off by non-paying customers avoid TOMO.
469,2,"This establishment advertises Free BYOB, but a $6.00 Corkage fee is now being charged. And Wow, watch your credit card, and the amount you sign for! Food is expensive for a strip mall atmosphere, OK but not fine dining. Entrees are bare, with no garnish or side items included. Corkage fee and a plate fee (for bringing in wine or a Birthday cake) are extra added charges. AND, as I recently found out, if THEY forget to add an item to your bill (like a soda refill), they will arbitrarily increase the charge amount you have authorized on your credit card AFTER YOU LEAVE, to pay themselves later for THEIR own mistake. Without notifying you! AND this is on top of a generous tip, and in a Birthday situation, where most other restaurants would gladly comp the Birthday boy/girl a free soda refill. When I called to complain, I was told I should have noticed the omission on the bill when it was originally presented to me. SORRY, I do not count how many sodas my guest has when taking them out for their Bday, nor do I expect my bill to be changed AFTER I leave. I was also told it was probably too late to refund the unauthorized charge to my credit card. All in all, this experience leaves a BAD TASTE."

It doesn’t get the clothes cleaned and now a completely doesn’t work. We reset it, we’ve had the service guy come in and replace a bunch of parts on it. It’s past its one year warranty and doesn’t work anymore. Piece of junk! Junk, junk, junk!!! Waste of money. Do you not buy the Whirlpool tub loading washing machine!"
471,2,"I contacted GRS in late March about downloading My Diamond Touch software onto the existing hardware I had. I was told by Jordan that this could be done with no problem for $600-$700 the next week. I didn't hear from them for a couple of weeks. Called back and Jordan was no longer there. Luke told me it would be $800. I told him I was quoted $600-$700 by Jordan. He talked to his superior and they agreed to do it for $700, but they needed my debit card information now. I gave it to them. $700 was taken out of my account the following day. I was then told it would be 3 weeks before Aurther, the tech could come out. I told them I didn't like paying for work BEFORE it was done. I was told that they were having trouble collecting on outstanding invoices and this is how it is now done. Aurther came to perform the work, but was not able to do it. I was later told by Luke that Gene (the Vice Pres) had decided that the price would now be $1400 or I could get my money back. I waited a while to decide if it was worth double what I had been quoted. I decided not to move forward and asked for my money back. I was then told by Luke that Gene had said I would receive credit with them instead of a refund. I don't need credit with them if I'm no longer in need of their services. I've called other POS companies to see what could be done. I finally called to speak with Tom Bronson about the situation. He listened, said he would talk to his people and get back with me. That was October. I called one more time on 11/21/11 and left a message explaining that I was going to file a complaint. They had Luke call me back. Still would not refund my money."
472,1,"I know we have all had a bad experience at a restaurant from time to time, but now I can say that from this past experience that I am not only shocked but absolutely appalled!  I have been to this restaurant in the past before and they just seem to be going downhill from here. Especially after this past Mother's Day experience. Chef Ramsey would definitely agree with me about the fact that this establishment has no regard whatsoever for the customer's concerns- much less, the quality of service to put it quite politely. It's one thing when you have had a bad experience with a waitress, but when you try to tell the Manager or Owner's wife- to advise them of a bad customer service experience with their staff and they publicly embarrass you as well as themselves (yelling at customers with flailing arms and telling them not to complain and that if they don't like how they are treated then they don't have to come back again!). Keep in mind prior to all this there were people who had walked out without paying their bill because of lack of service and in one other case a comment something about not very good service at all by another patron who we had talked to as they were leaving.  It ended up with us getting a small discount on my side dish (needless to say I gave $0.00 for a tip) and on my way out I made sure to tell anybody coming into the place to steer clear of it.  I would suggest this to anyone and I will continue to do so anytime I am given the opportunity. Worst of all since then in my research I have found other information on the internet through other sites that the owner has a problem keeping his hands to himself with the waitresses, especially the morning staff women!"
473,1,"My girl and i used to work at luckys and the owners fotini and george would put my hours in the computer incorrectly all the time and would not pay me for all the hours they owed.me for. Also they would pay most of my hours off the book so i would get screwed at tax time. A big ethical problem i had with luckys is for cash paying customers, after they left they would void out the order and put the money in the register so they didn't have to pay sales tax, which they admitted to me on multiple occasions. I tried to let the government know in the past to no avai, so i hope the right person reads this. Fotini has personally stolen tips from the waitresses, including from my girlfriend on multiple occasions. Fotini would take money right off the table and tell my girl that the customer didn't leave a tip and one time she did this to a relative of mine. This was the last draw for me. Please if you go to eat here give your tip directly to the waitress. I have many other complaints including making the cooks serve rotten food because the owners will fire anyone who throws food out (I've seen it personally). And last but not least George, one of the owners is a pervert with not only waitress but with the underage waitresses. Also which is the most disturbing is the way he handles children, especially his nephews. Now i am dead serious about this, i believe he molested them, and the family is keeping it quiet, so he doesn't go to jail. Even his brother stacey hinted that george has a ""problem"" with children. Please think again before going to eat here..."
474,2,"I was looking forward to going to Jalisco because I have been told that they have a permanent in-house troup of mariachi musicians and folklorico dancers and some of the best and most authentic Mexican food this side of the Rio bravo (or Rio Grande, if you prefer the American name.) We went to a great deal of trouble selecting the right clothes and wanted to have a super good time and even phoned ahead for reservations. We didn't even stop to ask whether the mariachis are playing there are not. I sang with mariachis semi-professionally and have appeared in numerous films, so it is something that I enjoy doing. When we arrived, I was told that not only did we not have reservations but they were closing the kitchen and it was only 8 p.m. on a Friday night??????? THEY REFUSED TO SERVE US AND ALL OTHER PEOPE WHO WERE IN LINE BEHIND US! We were not admitted and had to eat at another Mexican restaurant which are getting more difficult to find with all of the real estate DEVELOPERS to get rid of ALL MEXICAN INFLUENCE in downtown Austin and Austin in general... and that includes NO MEXICAN FOOD PLACES! Do they really have mariachis at Jalisco Restaurant and Bar in Austin,TX? I don't know but they have plenty of rich, white, obnoxious yuppie college kids and some really lazy servers and personnel! Do they have good regional Mexican specialities at Jalisco Restaurant and Bar in Austin, TX??????????? I don't know but I do know that RESTAURANTS THAT DON'T HONOR DINNER RESERVATIONS -- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE TO DRIVE 45 MILES ONE-WAY TO GET THERE--- RIP OFF YOUR TIME, MONEY AND GASOLINE NOT TO MENTION THE WEAR AND TEAR ON YOUR VEHICLE! I don't know but you only get one chance with me, hermano! "
475,1,"By far the most over rated restaurant in the city. I travel from city to city due to business and have been fortunate enough to dine in some of the most distinguished restaurants in the country and I have to say that I had the worst experience @ Hectors. The staff doesn't really know what they are serving, their representation of Southern Cuisine was poor at best, and worst of all, Hector (the owner) has no clue about what service is. If you ask a customer if everything is alright and the customer responds that something is undercooked, you don't respond by saying, Oh, that's the way we cook it here and walk away. Next time, try to find out what the customer wants and fix the problem! And to charge triple the price for a dessert that was meant to be a simple cake, A RIPOFF! Not only will I never dine there again, I will go out of my way to tell everyone I know in the Park Cities, Preston Hollow area as well as any review site I find on the internet about what poor service and food."
476,1,"I must begin by stating that the few employees that i spoke with were very kind.  The customer service seemed higher than an average car wash. Anyway, I should have known better and really, this could be considered my own fault.  I am simply writing this report in hopes that I will divert new car owners' business.  If you care to keep your nice paint job, take your business elsewhere or wash your car yourself. It is winter, and quite a pain to hand-wash a car when the temperatures remain in the 20s and 30s.  I decided to take my brand new BMW to Dirty Car Wash in Antioch, Tennessee.  When I say brand new, I mean that my car was less than a month old.  It had recently snowed so the place was busy.  I waited in the drive through line and rolled my window down when it was my turn.  I asked the attendant about prices and informed him that I only wanted an exterior wash. I then asked him if they offered a 'touch free' wash.  Without delay, he answered, Our car wash uses soft, microfiber sponges.  (or some material of the like.)  I was skeptical but decided that I really didn't want to wash my car in the cold, myself.  Besides, microfiber?  That stuff is supposed to be gentle, right?  I drove around, got out, and watched as the man hopped in my car.  His partner was still scrubbing salt off of the vehicle in front of my car with what looked like a frazzled push broom (YES, I know it was not a push broom but the contents in the bristles are what could easily be found in one.) This is when I should have immediately changed my mind.  Instead, I watched through the window and cringed as they scrubbed away on my car.  Scrub, scrub, scrub, scratch, scratch, scratch... back and forth in a relentlessly harsh manner.  What was astounding is that they didn't even rinse the brush after washing the last filthy vehicle before moving onto mine. Now, the scratches in my clear coat glisten in the sun.  Thanks Dirty Car."

478,1,"Kevin martin from car acquire called me after looking at my Car sale ad on Kijiji. He was so confident that he convinced me to go with them. and he went into detail and said I guarantee your car will be sold in 2 weeks I asked him what if it didn't sell in the 2 week period. I was told by Kevin Don't worry there are so many people looking for this car at this moment that you don’t have to worry about the refund and just in case we can't sell the car in 90 days then I would be entitled to a full refund of $374.99 and the administrative fee of $124.95. I called to cancel the listing after 2 months, since i didn't receive a single call from buyer and neither Kevin provided the details of the websites where my car was showcasing. Every time i called to speak to him, he was never there to answer my questions. He gave me false promises since the beginning and now it's been four months and i haven't got my refund nor anyone calls me. Whenever i call they talk so rudely and say someone will contact me from the legal department. I have been so cheated by this company and specially Kevin Martin. I lost my money as well as four months, i which i could have sold my car on my own instead of relying on these cheaters. Now my car's value has further dropped by 6000 Dollars. They do not honor their sales pitches at all! In four months, they could not even find one interested person to call me to look for the call, forget about selling my car they were so much unprofessional lot of people who never keep their words. Company is full of liars and cheaters. I need my money back from these fraudsters... Please help."
479,1,"I am so disappointed in this car wash!  I had high hopes b/c it's in such a convenient location, I was hoping things would work out better for my relationship with this car wash.  I'm cheap, so yes, rather than take it to be properly washed and hand dried, I thought I was conveniently drive it through the Car Wash Depot drive thru wash.  Granted I only paid $7.00, if I would have known it was going to make my car dirtier and scratch the paint, I would have NEVER done it!  I would have gladly paid to do it myself had I known... And to boot, there is NO dryer to help you out upon your exit... WTF?  Even if it was a cheap, crappy one I would have been happy...but no, nothing. So is it worth bitching about a $7 loss?  Probably not, but it is worth it when I have to have the scratches repaired on the sides of my car from the spinning clothes filled with dirt and stones. Oh and the best part, was that their were still leaves stuck to the side of my car... like that was too heavy for the side wishy washy noodle things to get.  THE RAIN WOULD HAVE DONE ME BETTER SERVICE FOR FREE 99. Sorry Car Wash Depot, but the people gets to know!"
480,1,THIS BY FAR IS THE WORST DEALERSHIP I HAVE EVER PURCHASED A VEHICLE FROM. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF. THEY WILL LIE CHEAT AND STEAL YOU INTO AN AUTOMOBILE. BUYER BEWARE IF YOU BUY A CAR FROM HERE HAVE IT INSPECTED BY A ASC CERTIFIED MECHANIC BEFORE YOU SIGN ON THE LINE IF NOT YOU GET NO LOVE HERE AT CAR SOURCE DETROIT. THEY BUY CARS FROM THE AUCTIONS AND SELL THEM RIGHT TO YOU WITH PRE EXSISTING CONDITIONS WITHOUT ANY INSPECTIONS AND THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FOR IT WITHIN A DAY OR TWO OF PURCHASE SO BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE.
481,1,"I'm with all the other posters. Yes, great, you helped me when I was in need, but this company takes advantage of people that are in dire need of help and have no where else to go. That is not a favor, take your money else where. I tried to return my car because 3 days after I got it the brakes went out. The sales man gave me some BS story about how hard it was to take the car back and that returning it ment I couldn't get another car and blah blah blah. I would love to see how many of the cars actually last through the lease. Mine won't, and I refuse to dump anymore money into the P.O.S. Don't dig yourself deeper, buy a junk car for 1000 bucks and save. You'll be in a better situation. UAC... they are just a pain in the ass to deal with. Trust me, you want no part of either of the companies."

483,1,"I bought a dash cam, online, from this company after many inquiries as to the fact that they were a company based in the USA and had a phone number for customer service.  With shipping and handling i paid $78.95. Before i received my order, I found an identical dash cam for less with free shipping from the USA.  I was told No Problem to return.  They sent instructions and DEMANDED to send back CERTIFIED Mail to HONG KONG.  the cost to return was almost one third the cost of camera. I sent it back and it was certified as delivered. I have been waiting 61 days for my refund.   Every time I call the company I am told I MUST contact billing and they are only contactable via email.   Every email reply says exactly the same thing which is this:  Thank you for your inquiry. Taking care of your concerns is very important to all of us at Evolution Worldwide. Our payments are handled by PayPal, the safest and most secure internet payment company. We have had a deluge of orders and are behind in taking care of everyone. please be patient and your refund will be processed. A complete run around and i believe they are now blocking my phone number. Tried calling 10 times yesterday and after connection the line immediately cut off.  Just tried again today and same thing.   Their corporate address is in Miami, and their web site says this:  Why Choose Car Camera Direct? When you buy from Car Camera Direct, you're buying right from the factory. So you pay the lowest possible price for a camera of this quality. Car Camera Direct ships worldwide at a low flat rate. Only after having a problem or return do they tell you the Miami office is just a phone bank.  ALL orders, service, or refunds go through Hong Kong.  I have since bought 3 of these identical cameras on eBay for $21 each with Free Shipping.  This company is a FRAUD.  "

486,1,"Like many shady car companies that guarantee a car for little to no money down and in the long run charge an exorbitant amount. Car Outlet is no exception. Companies like Car Outlet pray on poor, desperate people for a quick and easy buck. Please be aware when purchasing a car from Car Outlet. In all honesty just walk, take a bus take a taxi because in the long run a taxi will be cheaper.   I purchased a car here a few years back and thankfully just finished paying it off. They screwed me over with a mediocre, BS insurance that when I needed it, it didn't cover me and I ended up paying out of pocket. If you can get an insurance elsewhere that is valid and will cover you don't let Car Outlet screw you over with their phony excuse of an insurance that if you're already struggling will certainly land you in the poor house.   At the time that I bought the car I was desperate to get a car, what a fool I was getting a car from Car Outlet. Let me start with, this car ended up costing me after the crazy interest rate (which the sales person said would be lower, he wrote it on the paper, but it turned out to be much higher, like I said I was a fool.) Started paying in 2013 and after the 4 years of finishing paying off a 2004 (it is now going to be 2017) Chevy Trailblazer cost me $20,000! For a car that is now worth around $2,500.   Right away I had problems with the car but roughly after the warranty expired. (At the time there was a 90 day warranty if anything was wrong with the car they could fix it.) -the main lights/beams don't stay on all the time -the dashboard meters went out and don’t work -the fans on the roof don’t work -the cooling and heating suck -the cooling and heating setting for the back seats doesn’t work -one of the electrical plugs doesn’t work and never has -the hatch/rear door doesn’t open or close -the back window only closes and opens from time to time - the check engine light always comes on for no reason -the acceleration sucks, always has -the 4WD eventually gave out -they 'forgot' to give us the tool needed to get the spare tire so if you need to change the spare your screwed (I guess the Trail Blazer needs a special extension and lug breaker) -the car always has some kind of coolant leak -its rusted like crazy underneath, always has been but time has made it worse -this rusting caused the freaking tire to just randomly fall off completely one day and were waiting for the others to fall any day because of the rust even though we repaired as much as we could -this has also caused the uneven wear of the tires   I just want to let people know that if you can just save up the money and honestly just buy a car from craigslist for a couple thousand dollars, you will be better off then buying from a sleazy business like Car Outlet. Please learn from my foolishness/experience and shop. Elsewhere."
487,3,"In latter September, I purchased a 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe intended to accommodate various HAM radio support functions I’m involved in.  I installed a second battery along with the wires needed to mount a HAM radio under the back seat, but was leery about running the wires myself, as I’ve not had sufficient experience in doing such work.  At this point I need to make it clear that I’ve used the vehicle for a few weeks, and have had ample time to make sure that pretty much everything is in good working order.  On October 2nd, I went to a meeting to discuss a recent success in supporting a 100 mile marathon.  Prior to the meeting, I stopped by Car Toys on SE 82nd Ave in Portland and initially talked to Parke Arnold, one of their sales people, to find out how much it would cost to have them run the wires for me.  The tech explained that rather than try to run them through the firewall, and down under the center console, it would be easier and just as clean to run them along the doors.  I was quoted $65.00 for labor and $6.50 for parts to complete the job, and it would take about an hour. As I live a considerable distance from the SE 82nd Ave store, I decided to go to the closer store at 12195 SW Canyon Rd in Beaverton.  I drove down on October 3rd to have the installation completed.  The person I talked to told me it would cost $93.00 an hour for a little over an hour to complete the job.  I mentioned that I’d had a quote from the SE 82nd Ave store for $71.50 for the complete job.  The salesperson seemed a little uncomfortable, and talked to an installer, then told me he would talk to the manager.  We agreed on a total installation cost of $75.00.  I wasn’t as comfortable with the installers at this store, as they seemed a little unsure of the time it would take, but decided to have them do it anyway as I was going to need the vehicle to provide support for another marathon. The installation seemed to go well, and later that day I completed the installation and setup of the HAM radio I purchased to install in the vehicle.  The following day (Sunday) I got up early to get to my support location on time.  When I arrived at my location, I went to turn the headlights off, and to my surprise, the knob had been pressed into the dash to the point where I could not easily turn the headlights off.  I had to pull the knob out in order to turn it and turn the headlights off (keep in mind that the headlight switch is right next to the area where the wires would have been pulled through the firewall).  As I’ve had to perform the same task several times on the previous marathon support, I know for a fact that the light switch was in good working order prior to having the wires run. I took the vehicle back to the Canyon Rd store to ask what could be done about the issue.  An installation technician came out to look at it with a salesman and immediately told me that it could not possibly have been the installers as they would not have worked around the switch. I mentioned that they would have had to get under the dash right next to it in order to get the wires through.  He still insisted that they could not have been responsible for the damage.  I went back into the store to discuss the issue with the manager, and was told he was in the bathroom and would be available shortly.  I was asked for the invoice, and provided it.  The salesperson stapled the cards of the installation manager and assistant store manager to my invoice and told me that one or the other of them would call me that day (two days ago).  I’ve not heard anything back, and at this point I’m not sure that I will.  It would seem that the management is taking the word of the installers over me, which I don’t think is very good customer service.  I will wait a few more days and see if I am contacted before trying anything.  In the meantime, it would seem appropriate to publicize the facts of this case."
488,2,I bought a car from Car Hop because I was desperate. The car was a piece if junk. It broke down shortly after I bought it. Now the car has not ran in over 4 months. Its still in the shop and they can't figure out what's wrong with it. My warranty is no good and I have spent a fortune on rental cars. They refuse to help me by 1. Give me another car or 2. Fix it for me under warranty. I refuse to pay another penny on a vehicle that doesn't run. They refused both so I'm on my own. This company does not stand behind there vehicles. I don't no what I can do. But I'm not going to pay them any more money.

Asked if it runs, representative said yes, you can test drive, if 750.00 is to much for a vehicle, we can lower it. We set up an appointment for this morning, 10am. They were to hold jeep overnight, the drive for us was 1hr 20 min one way... we got there, no jeep, many different stories, all the vehicle on the site, salesman said we're incorrect, very misleading.

490,3,"I purchased a 1992 Mazda 929 from Lamb Car Company on 06/29/99, for the amount of $9995,00 and put $3000.00.On my why home I tried to turn on the so called $2000.00 (I was told), stereo system on and it did not work. Come to find out neither did the back windows along with several other things. During the course of buying the car IU had told the car salesman that I was going on vacation to Sacramento, which I did. After returning home, I went immediately back to the car place and informed them that I did not want the car. At this time the salesman, who’s name is Frank, told me that I could exchange the car for another car as soon as the Fineice company got a clear title. I asked him how long this would take and he said about 5 to 10 days and he said he would call me as soon as it cleared. I did not hear from him so I went back in again, at this time he had one of the lot boys take the car down to the smog place and had it smogged. He then told me the same thing that he told me the first time. They need a clear title. I waited again and then went down again/. I told Frank that I was worried about the time that was passing by, he said don't worry about that, we don't care about that. I had explained to him that all these things did not work on the car and that I believe the car has either been in a flood because I have mold growing on the head liner, corroded electrical parts and that it smelled like mold every time you turn the air-conditioner on. I am also having problems with the brake light always being on, too. Now, for the passed 3 weeks I have been trying to get a hold of Frank and he never there so finally I went down and spoke to a man who wrote up the contact, Zack, and the next day I called there several times and spoke to Frank. He said he could trade the car for another if I wanted but I would lose my down payment and I would have to pay tax and license again. The tax and license I will pay but not my 3,000. dollar down payment. Have they done anything that I could have any recourse on to get my down payment back."
491,1,"Rented from FOX Rent a Car in Toronto. First off the one guy that picks you up from the airport is also the one that drives you in from the airport and checks over your car with you. MAKE SURE TO CHECK OVER THE CAR before you leave the lot! The individual will quickly look over the car and say nothing is wrong. BUT when you return to drop off the car, they will get you!!! I was personally dinged for a scratch on the front bumper (glad I booked with a credit card with insurance!!!!). I was late for the airport and they wanted me to sign a form that stated I was responsible for the repair. I couldn't believe it!!! Then I was pestered constantly for when I got into an accident - I DID NOT GET INTO AN ACCIDENT, it was obviously there before, but I think this is the way the make up for their low rates. Also, got billed for an extra day because I brought the car back at 1:10pm, and picked up the car at 1:00pm the week before. The reason I was late, was because the one guy was out of the office dropping off another client. Had to argue after the fact to get the credit for the late arrival.

492,1,"Car Acquire on Caracquire.com is a total ripoff! I was selling my vehicle and posted it on Kijiji, shortly afterward a Car Acquire rep contacted me claiming to have 7 buyers interested in my vehicle. He talked me into signing up with them promising to have my vehicle sold within two weeks, GUARANTEED!! Signing up cost $379 plus a $144 registration fee, their policy states that if the car is not sold within 90 days you get your money back, but careful, it's only the $379 that you can get back. To sign up, the process was very simple, however after I did not get a single phone call about my vehicle in 3 months, requesting my money back is a HUGE process. They demand all kinds of information that was not required for the sign-up like insurance information etc. Do not trust this company. They lie. When I asked them where the 7 buyers went after I registered, they claimed that every one of them had trouble getting financing, what lame excuses... In conclusion, do not waste your money on this service unless you want to donate your money to fraud..."

495,1,"Was in Baton Rouge visiting my son and stopped at Barry's Car Wash on Essen Lane.  When my car was returned to me, the driver's seat was damaged fairly extensively - scratched across the back of the seat.  I originally thought it was something on the seat and asked one of the workers to wipe it down some more.  After he wiped it down, you could see that the leather was, in fact, scratched.  I approached the manager who immediately took a defensive and rude demeanor.  He stated he thought it looked like it came from a belt, MY belt.  I was wearing a cotton belt and showed him, by rubbing it on the leather, that cotton did not scar leather.  I then agreed with him that it looked to be from a belt and asked to see everyone who had driven my car.  The first person we saw had a smooth leather belt and I agreed that it would not cause any damage to my car.  Then we went to the back of the establishment to see the person that drove my car in to the wash.  He was wearing a brown studded/riveted belt which obviously was consistent with the damage to my seats.  I was not allowed by the manager and claims manager to take a photograph of the belt.  They stated it would violate the worker's civil rights???  Then they tried to claim that this worker didn't drive my car, so we went to review their own video recordings which clearly showed the employee with the studded/riveted belt driving and getting out of my car.  At that point, they both appeared to change their attitude and were fairly cordial to me.  They gave me a claim form to fill out and asked me to call back on Tuesday, July 27, 2010.  When I called back on Tuesday, I was told that they were not going to honor the claim until I brought my car back to them (I live 90 miles away) at a time where the manager, owner, and the employee in question could be there.  They want to have the employee get in and out of my car again to verify it was him who damaged the car.  This is clearly an attempt to deny responsibility AGAIN.  They had every opportunity when I was at the business to investigate the situation and I allowed them to photograph my car (despite the car's civil rights), etc.  This is a simple case of an employee making a mistake and causing damage to my car.  They should admit the error, admit liability and pay for the repair of my seat.  I have owned the car for approximately one month (bought it used) but have pictures that show the seats were in perfect condition when I bought it. I have had to enlisted the assistance of my insurance company and my attorney to resolve this matter. I would never recommend doing business with these people!!!"
496,1,"I purchased the Interior Salon Detail for $69.99 at 10:02 A.M. on a Friday.  I was charged extra for the wheels and tire dressing ($6) which I didn't ask for.    The chemical smell was horrible after the detail and was still very strong after 3 days with the windows down and the trunk open (they claimed it would dissipate in 1 - 2 hours).  The leather spray cleaner they used soaked into my perforated leather seats soaking my pants as I sat in the car. The floor mats are still dirty and were totally soaked with some smelly cleaning agent.  I was there for 1 hour and 45 minutes but was told the detail would only take 1 hour.  I finally had to ask to have my car back.  When I told my daughter this story, she said she and many of her friends and neighbors had experienced some of the same problems and refuse to give their business to this carwash. I wish I had known. Hope this helps others from making the same mistake."
497,3,"Apache Sands in Mesa, horrible service and bad customer service. I went and had my car washed due to being dirty and having some water stains on one side of my car.  When I got it back it was still dirty on one side.  Not only was it dirty on the side of the car, the rims were dirty too.  After arguing with them I asked for my money back because the service was below par.  The manager would not give me my money back and tried to sell me another service to remove the water spots.  I went home and within 20 minutes was able to remove the spots on my rims myself. I realize water spots are hard to get off some cars but should have been told they would be hard to get off. This is inacceptable service."
498,1,"I purchased a car from them.  Price was about $2500 over the price of comparable vehicles at the time (not even taking into account the very high 30,000 typical miles on their rental fleet).  A year later, I tried to trade it in with the same office, but trade-in value was Way under-bid.  It ended up costing well over $10,000 to own that car for the first year!   Doc fees and over a dozen different 'Taxes' ran multi-thousands of dollars!  Now, I’m trying to sell it, and is totally un-sellable, because it was used as a short-term rental!  Diminishes additional thousands of dollars off of the resale value; and is specifically listed in Carfaqs. I feel absolutely screwed over, especially since the main selling point was that I could trade it in with them if I didn’t like it, because they will give me the most money.  If the purchase price is 18k, the trade in is 12k. (plus two sets of $5,000 dollar fees that get re-added in).  UGH.  Buy that 18k used rental car?  The total purchase is going to be 22.5k.  (With trade in at 12k?) Don’t do it! Buy new, or buy Private Party!  If your buying used, then at the VERY least, don’t get a rental fleet vehicle!  There’s a reason they sell the car after 1 year, because it loses the MOST amount of money after 2 years. I HIGHLY un-recommend buying a car there, unless you never plan on selling it, and don’t mind replacing the transmission prematurely. DO NOT trade in a vehicle there.  DO NOT even bother getting them to buy yours.  horrible business model, designed to get the most out of people thinking they are getting 'great deals' on rental fleets. "
499,1,"Went to Danny's family car wash for a complete car wash. They wash exterior, vacuum, windows, etc. The car was not vacuumed properly, and underneath area of all doors still had dirt which should have been wiped down. After the car wash, I went back around to speak to person who originally helped me. I advised him that the car had not been properly vacuumed, and there was dirt underneath the door areas. Employee referred me to a manager (Oscar) who said that the car was vacuumed. I pointed it out to him and showed the carpet to him, throughout the vehicle. Oscar said if you think you can do better, then go and vacuum the car yourself. Well I did just that, and after I was done, I went over to show him how well I vacuumed the car and he said it looks the same. I then asked him why they could not wipe the dirt from underneath the doors. He could not give me a logical explanation. I called Danny's main phone number and spoke to a secretary. I explained the situation to her and she said I'm sorry about that sir, I will have the General Manager contact you. This was several weeks, and I still have not heard from anyone. Believe me, I was not asking for any freebies. I simply wanted to point out the terrible service that I received. They obviously don't care because they have car washes throughout the valley, and must be making enough. Business being conducted in this fashion will eventually bring you down (MR. DANNY'S). I just want people to be aware that DANNY'S FAMILY CAR WASH does a TERRIBLE job... By the way the car wash, oil change, fuel fill up, etc. cost me well over 100.00. GREAT SERVICE DANNY'S! What a joke!!!!!!!"
500,1,"I used to be their biggest fan. Not anymore... RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN. I have gone there for years. I have referred many people there. The first time I felt a little suspicious of them was when they told me my e-break had gotten stuck and broken...also ruining my rotors. I took it to another shop and they couldn't find anything wrong. To this day....it is fine. My husband said maybe he got us confused with another customer... we let it slide. Fast forward to April. We have them do our 100K service. Tell him to do whatever it says is recommended. So timing belt, flushes... told him to do it all. Now, 8 months later... one of my friends is driving the car down the highway. Loud crashing sound and the car stops. The tow truck guy says the timing belt broke in his opinion. I call Bob and ask him if that was something covered by the 12 month warranty provided on the belt and service performed. He immediately says...we didn't replace the water pump. Ummm... ok. So I ask if he sees the service and he said yes we had it done in April. The belt was changed but not the water pump. He said it wasn't recommended. Every google search I have done says that is recommended for the water pump and belt to be done at the same time. That is not the issue however. He tells us it's the idler pulley, it locked up causing the belt to melt and break. He will have to do a $1200 repair before he can tell me if there is damage to the motor. I trust him...we have done business for years. I say ok. Then he tells us after that there is about $3000 more in damage he can't fix. That will be $1200. My husband calls a buddy of his trying to unload the car. He has a car lot and we were thinking a mechanic may want to buy the car as a project car. He tells us Bob should have known that there was guaranteed damage from her driving 70 miles per hour when it broke. Then tells me that $1200 seems really high... we email him a receipt. While I wait to hear back I get in touch with Mitsubishi....a certified Mitsubishi mechanic tells me that not only did he over charge but it was by about $600... he charges double what the dealership does. Then I notice our receipt... a timing belt component kit... then we were also charged for each component individually. Nice. The next day I get an email from my friend’s buddy, same estimate... $600. Both agree he should have never done the work anyway because there was 100% chance the engine was damaged. They both recommended replacing the motor. Both are suspicious that this should have been a warranty issue. I am told to ask for the parts he bought and receipts for them. Legally he has to provide these. He brings some of the parts (NO WATER PUMP IN TH BOX) He tells us he will not provide the part receipts because he doesn't have to let us see the wholesale pricing he gets. The receipt for the 100 K service? He has a hard time finding (Strangely on day one he pulled it up in seconds while we are on the phone) OH wait he found it... gives it to my husband. Looking over it I notice it is an estimate... not an invoice and it was typed up TODAY. I call him he stutters a bit and said its a list of what they did. I tell him I need the actual receipt,.. The one I signed? If there is a Component kit on there he is liable for all of it and he knows it|. He can't find it/. I send my husband up there to get him to look on the computer in front of him. Him and his friend walk in and there are shredding noises coming from Bob's office. That's reassuring'. So, then to top it off they broke the handle on the driver side. Apparently there was a crack in it... Funny. I never saw one before. So now I have a ruined motor and a broken driver side handle so you can't even get into the car. Thanks Bob... your receipt says Honesty, Accuracy, and Quality... Lies. I feel even worse as I don't even know how many of my friends and family he has ripped off. I referred him to everyone, SAD… I am now replacing the water pump he put in, supposedly new. The guy replacing my motor said he would not guarantee the work if I didn't because the one Bob put in is covered in sealant and leaking. Being as the car hasn't been started since he put it in he couldn't have put in a new one. Also, he told us the $1200 repair was the only way to know if I had engine damage. Mitsubishi recommends a compression test, SAD… My handle he told my husband was cracked and that is how it broke in their care...he told the BBB it was broken before he got it. I am trying to track down the tow guy to testify that it was not broken. Also, I have the girl that was driving the car that day (not me) as a witness. When I called him about the water pump he told me he had no interest in talking to me. I am building a case to take him to court. I have the water pump and video of the work being done to repair the damage they caused. I have done business with him for years... sent everyone I knew to him. I now wonder how many times I have been ripped off. He is a bad man."
501,1,"I purchased 6 treatments two weeks before this company shut their doors. I only received one treatment on the day I paid the total amount of $600.00 which is what they demanded. They said I could not pay in payments and the total amount was due on that day. When I showed up 2 weeks later for my 2nd treatment the doors had been locked by the landlord. For weeks I have been calling their number and receiving a phone message that the mail box for Spa Beautica was full. Now I get a recording that states the spa has been closed indefectibly and it gives another number for contact. When you call that number you get a fax machine. I do not have a contract but I do have my cancelled check in the amount of $600.00. This was a very dishonest way to do business, so buyer beware. ALWAYS get a signed contract and NEVER pay in advance. "
502,1,"After going to the dentist, I received a bill for a few hundred dollars.  Upon calling and asking why it was not covered under insurance I was told that my insurance was exhausted for the year.  This was just a few weeks before my insurance had reset for the year.  Next, I have a conversation with the woman Nancy in the front office and told her that you need to let me know from this point forward if my insurance is not going to cover my visit and if there were going to be costs not covered by any of my visits. She agreed that it would not happen again and that in the future they would call the insurance company first and let me know if there were going to be costs not covered.  The end of the year arrives, and I get a general cleaning about 8 weeks before the end of the year.  Here we go again.  An over three hundred dollar bill arrives in the mail a few weeks later.        I called them this time and argued and told them that you had specifically told me this would not happen again.  The cleaning could have waited 8 weeks without any question. After filing a BBB report (Case # 390556 if you’re interested in reading the unbelievable response of this stupid dentist) in where I offer to pay half and move on I promptly get a response.  This response goes on telling me that I should redirect my anger at the insurance company and how it is impossible for them to know how much it will cost to administer services. After demonizing the insurance companies he then goes on to demand full payment (A direct excerpt from his response: The dental insurance companies have a way of playing the devil and directing the blame to the dental office providing appropriate treatment.) Nearly nine months pass by and now this Jacka decides that he wants to post a new response on the BBB.  Nine months later!  He starts off with expressing his concern because I had posted a negative review on Yelp and then blabbers on to blame the Obama administration (of which I am no fan but really?) and then offers offensive advice on how this matter between he and I is like a problem between my wife and I.  (Another excerpt: my advice is that it would be better to have a private matter resolved face to face.  I'm sure you would not want your wife telling the entire world your personal problems...)  This guy is nothing but a crook who uses corrupt business practices in order to rip off his patients.  He does not care one bit about his patients, only his reputation.  Any attorneys out there who wish to help me get a restraining order against this guy would be appreciated. I really don’t trust this lunatic as he has my personal information."

504,2,"I just returned from what I believe was going to be an intensive, “all inclusive” weekend training event in Botox and Dermal Filler. I am a nurse practitioner in practice for more than 14 years. I work with a physician who operates a busy medical SPA so this training was very important to me. This was advertised by the Aesthetics Medical Educators Training as the most intensive program available compared to all the others. I didn’t pay for the course but I was the one who did all the research and my doctor paid for all of this, including my travel and hotel. I feel horrified and responsible because I told him this was the best course out there, based on the website. He trusted my judgment. Next time I am going to look for videos from people who actually attended the course, not just what I read in print. They have a detailed package explaining why they are different and how much better their training is. The course was a complete joke, I feel violated and ripped off that I believed their advertising. The instructor was poorly trained himself and when he talked about Botox Cosmetic, he was not able to intelligently compare the product to either Xeomin or Dysport, which they advertise we would also receive training on. They had comparison charts but, when asked about one of the products, the instructor told me to “just look in the book”, it’s all there. The other students in the class were equally surprised by the ridiculous, retarded answers this instructor continued to give the students. It became clear during the didactic training that the instructor just memorized the slides and was not qualified to teach others. They advertised that their instructors are experienced and top notched plastic surgeons, dermatologists and other experts, but the instructor we have should not be teaching anything in Aesthetics. The hands on in the afternoon was a ZOO! They spent more time trying to collect fees from the volunteers and get them organized then with teaching the students in the class. I learned very little during the hands on because it was too crowded, unorganized, too loud and most importantly, the instructor himself was NOT QUALIFIED to teach and knew very little. I left with none of the “pearls” that they talk about in their website. I doubt whether or not the instructor even practices Aesthetics at all in his practice. What a waste of time, and money, the courses were not cheap either, Thanks a lot Aesthetic Medical Educators Training for the rip off course you deliver. "
505,1,"I too have a complaint about Aesthetic Solutions in Red Deer, AB. I wish I would have done my research and found out about their shady practices before I went for cosmetic lasers. I had Affirm and XPL done by Lynette Curr. Marianne Badenhorst assured me she is/was well qualified and that no scarring or anything bad could happen. As a result of these procedures I have DNA and nerve damage (for which I have just finished 4 wks of very expensive Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatments to try and fix, to no avail), thermal cellular injury, burns, rolling, boxcar, ice-pick, atrophic and hypertrophic scarring. As well as irreversible chromosomal damage, active thermal bystander effect, fibroblast and elastin damage, cellular necrosis/apoptosis that has extended  from the epidermis into the papillary and reticular dermis, melasma, nose bleeds, pain in my facial bones, hypo-pigmentation, eyebrow, eyelash and hair loss, ringing in ears, chronically dry eyes and blurred vision, chronically dry skin on my face, itchy skin and so many other  disheartening things! I have been diagnosed by my GP, dermatologist and a specialist. In no way was I told that these things would happen...nothing about scarring or burns or nerve damage, etc. That's not to mention what it has done to me mentally and emotionally! I no longer leave my house unless I absolutely have to see my doctor and I have groceries delivered. I have been trying to find a plastic surgeon to see if there is anything that can be done. I found Dr. Kirsten Westburg in Red Deer, but she refuses to try to fix their mess because she is in league with Aesthetic Solutions as she sends patients to them for lasers! The only plastic surgeon that has been willing to try to fix the extensive damage is a Dr. Nathan Newman in California, but at $20,000 it doesn't look like I'll be getting any help any time soon. Please heed my warning... I advise, from my own experience, do not go to Aesthetic Solutions in Red Deer, you will regret it and more!!! "
506,1,"I too was 'duped' by the promise of better, younger looking skin. Marianne told me I was a perfect candidate for Affirm laser. I was dazzled by the blatant lies they told me. I had 2 Affirm lasers and one XPL. I was told.... you have the perfect skin for a high setting on this/these lasers. I'm obviously cutting this story very short.  Lynette Curr did the 'procedures' on me. She talked about how her and the others get these done all the time.  What a load!!!  She told me how to take care of my skin post-procedure, which I followed exactly! I moisturized, moisturized, moisturized... but it doesn't matter how much you moisturize after having such damaging heat go beyond the skin down to the muscle and bone.  After a couple of months my skin started to split apart!!! I complained, and they also told me to come back and have an Erbium laser done to correct what had happened. Isn't that an admittance to what they did wrong?! In my opinion, it is. I wanted my money back, but you can probably guess how that went! Needless to say, the skin on my face now covered with very large pores, deep, deep lines, sagging skin, stretch marks, atrophic scars, rolling scars, ice-pick scars and box-car scars. This is beyond disheartening. There are no words to describe how I feel. I look like someone took a knife to my face and made slices to it. It is literally devastating! I too went to my doctor and dermatologist looking for answers and they are very careful right now not to say too much. I have no answers as to what to do.  After my personal experience, I'd advise anyone that is thinking of having a laser treatment done...DON'T!!! You will regret it! It is my belief that all lasers will eventually 'fast-track' your aging process and more!  If I had known the kind of damage these money-hungry (in my opinion) people are willing to inflict on others, I would have stuck with facials! No matter what is promised, do your own investigating!!"

False advertising. I decided to go ahead with my treatments giving aesthetic medical the benefit of the doubt but despite my clean diet and exercise I did not lose an inch. Throughout my course of treatments, a different tech performed the procedure each time failing to take my measurements and did not display any knowledge of the machine or techniques. (A very low frequency machine that is sold Cheap on eBay.) My review along with other negative experiences were deleted off the Facebook and the option to post a review Is no longer available. My only regret was not researching this place before wasting my time and money. Purchase at your own risk."
508,3,Wow about 3 month or so I had contacted a advocacy group for dental care for people who couldn't afford to get work done by regular forum's of insurance or dental procedures that where desperately needed due to heal issues by no fault of my own You see several years ago I had to get a full hip reduction due to a faulty deck Though soon after I received my surgery is starting to have problems with my mouth and other parts of my body just started to Ack !to my surprise I was having Sirius medical issues with my teeth as they had started to deca and had several hundred visits to the emergency room due to the metal that was used in my hip reduction surgery is have went through many years of pain and suffering due to my already limited cash flow in had tried everything to get assistance with this issue. After many years and many entered contests I was finally going to just about give up until a few months ago I was contacted by a non-profit company that told me that if I had gotten all the basic dentistry work done by a insurance dentist locally that I had qualified for a makeover and that a advocacy group could get my services paid for. After I got all my teeth take out that the most expensive part was the extractions and consideration of such medical issues would be enough to qualify for the implants needed at no coast to myself so I proceeded to get this accomplished now after all this the same advocate agency told me that because I didn't have between 5000 and 10000 thousand dollars that I had no longer qualified and that my application would be no longer valid I'm now stuck with this If you have any suggestions for my current position please contact this post Thank you for your time and understanding Sincerely. 
509,1,"Before having surgery, I had some very important concerns.  One was, would there be a doctor where I live (post op) in case there were any problems since it would be difficult to get back to Florida often.  The answer was YES.  The second concern was if the surgery did NOT turn out right, would the Doctor correct it, again the answer was YES.  I was told that he would NEVER abandon his patients, well, after the surgery and the problems began, I called the office and they told me send pictures which I did, they assured all was normal.  A week later I still had problems they again told me to send pictures, the answers I got was either, they can’t see the problems in the photos or everything is normal and all will resolve.  After so many phone calls and pictures emailed to them I finally went back to Florida where the Doctor assured me that all will resolve\, needless to say over a year later and 30 or more phone calls to him and emails to him the problems STILL EXIST and the Doctor refuses to do anything to correct them.  He refuses to even see me, forcing me to seek another doctor who immediately saw the problems, said the surgery looked OFF and knew that this surgery was done by Dr. Cooper since many of his patients seek corrective surgery with these same problems. I paid Doctor Cooper plus all of the travelling I have done and now I am forced out my own pocket to pay even more money to make this look good.

511,1,"I'm not sure if this is considered a rip off report, but I definitely wanted to write this as a warning to others. I know when it comes to needing dental work, one can get desperate. On March 22,2018 I found their info online and decided to apply because I figured it couldn't hurt. Desperate times call for desperate measures am i right? So I filled out the application and received a call within half an hour. I was unable to answer, so they left a voicemail asking me to call back to conduct an interview. I received an email as well, letting me know they left a voicemail. I was to call back for a woman named Bita Davis. I called back and she wasn't available, so we set up an appointment for a call the next day at 1:15pm but was advised that if I didn't hear from them, to call around that time anyway. Well the next day rolls around and no call from them, so I call in. I am placed on hold for 10 minutes and in that time, three other people come on and tell me to hold, as if they didn't keep track of the calls or like it was a call center where the calls were answered by everyone in general and they didn't keep track of who they had already placed on hold. Someone finally answers and quickly hangs up before I could get a word out. I call back and explained I was hung up on, she was very polite, told me she would check to see if Bita was available. She immediately comes back and says Bita is on another line setting up another customer but that she could assist me. (I didn't get her name) She proceeded to explain that I would be going to a local dentist and that there is an initial fee of $50 to set up an appointment. She stated it was just a precautionary measure because there are a lot of no-shows. She explained I would pay the $50, set up an appointment, go in and get checked, and the dentist would come up with a treatment plan that we can both agree on. he would then submit that to Cosmetic Dentistry grants for approval. I explained that I didn't have the 50 now so I would have to call back. She let me know that was fine and to just call back Monday and offered to set up an appointment. She offered a few time and seemed irritated when i explained I worked 8-5 and could only speak to them from 1-2pm. I then explained I wouldn’t have the deposit on Monday but can call her Friday. This is when her politeness took a turn for the worst. She stated I had to call Monday. That she needed the deposit by then in order to keep my account open or she would have to close it. I explained that she was making me uneasy by pressuring me and she said well you don't have to do it, I'm just doing my job Her attitude had completely changed and i couldn't understand why a few days made a difference. She stated that's hoe the system works, i can't keep an account open without a deposit I definitely felt that this was a tactic many scammers use. one of those this is the last one in stock and if you don't get it now it'll be gone forever type thing. Again, I don't know if this is a scam, but I definitely wanted to advise people to be careful before they give they're card info to these people."
512,1,"These people burned my skin! I went in for a consultation and bought a package for laser treatment on my face.

In fact the owners name is Bob they said, who was also unavailable. I am not going back to this Facility, even though I will loose money.

513,1,"Ronald and Helen Greenberg promote their Microdermabrasion equipment which they say is ground breaking. They offer you to purchase a business based on placing these machines into salons and then you earn money by selling the consumables much like the coffee industry. The problem is they say their machines are worth $9.970 when in fact they are manufactured for about $1000. None of the salons that use the equipment get the results they promise, and they never produce the income they state. In fact, not one of the 'distributors' they have put on make any money at all and they have all lost their money. Ronald and ZHelen Greenberg are con-artists and scam the money. Stay away."
514,2,"I am here to relay a story, less all the boring dates and times, which are extensive... I'll just start off with: Once upon a time a Laser Hair removal device was purchased for what was a fair market price from Sam Lehrer's Laser Outlet. Shipment was received and along came instructions that the use of a jim clip or more commonly known as a paper clip to jimmy the unit for normal use would be necessary (after all, it is used). After further evaluation, we've found that this is in violation of use as it is not in working order. In this diminished capacity, the unit worked for a short few months before it became apparent that the unit needed some service. When cleaned by a professional servicing company, a brown sludge was found inside of the unit. They also reiterated that using it in its current state was ill-advised. Sam Lehrer was contacted for replacement. That replacement never came. No compensation, concessions or rebates for the monies paid came either. A lawsuit was filed and many transactions between Attorneys transpired. Unfortunately, due the nature of the expenditure, after failed attempts at a resolution, I made the decision that this would not be economically feasible to continue... litigation for restitution might cost me more than I had initially paid for the device. I pulled the plug on the lawsuit. This is my first attempt at relaying the facts of my story. I am not here to mud sling, but to add just another story of the fraud that has been obviously perpetrated, evidenced by the 1st page of googling Sam Lehrer Laser. I believe there is enough negative press and complaints online that anyone considering doing business with this individual would be for-warned of the likelihood of a bad experience. I am using an alias, because who knows how far a fraud might go to try and retaliate or scream libel from the rooftops (or on an internet message boards~ to be more specific). We can all use our reason and common sense to agree that someone that has to constantly defend their position is, at the very least, suspect. I'm not interested in a fight, I already went the route of trying to do this in a legal manner with which my Attorney was met with outrageous claims of asset redistribution to the tune of 4 Million in earnings from one year to running a business at a loss the next. The name of the company continues to change, but OZ behind the curtain remains Sam Lehrer.Sam, as I'm sure you'll probably read: The truth doesn't have to explain itself. The TRUTH just IS."
515,1,"Malti O'Mahoney, James Anthony O'Mahoney and Peter Anthony Grant run a Phoenix Company Anyone thinking of going to this clinic think twice, and think hard. In December 2005 after returning from Thailand where I had been living I had a series of laser hair removal sessions in Thailand due to the low cost. The treatments were near completion when I returned to the UK. I was, at the time, living close by and found what was then called Boston Clinic at a slightly different address om Moscow RD (same owners) and I enquired about whether they could finish my treatments, which were maybe 1-3 left for complete hair removal. They told me they absolutely could help me and I went for my first treatment with a technician that did a decent job. My second appointment came and then technician advised me that as my hair was so fine it was best for me to use the Lumenis Lightsheer (diode) laser to complete my treatments. I agreed to a patch test. I came back and reported that while there were no adverse reactions I did not see a better result than I had with the other laser, safer for my skin type. I chose to proceed with the treatment. During the treatment I felt excruciating pain on my legs as the technician did my treatment. I immediately told her and she said, YOU JUST HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN, I WILL ONLY DO ONE PASS. Around 10 minutes later I felt even worse burning and noted welts up and down my legs which started to blister. I again brought this up to the technician who told me that, THIS HAPPENS SOMETIMES, DO NOT WORRY. I left with instructions to use lavender they tried to sell me to put on the wounds. In the coming days the blisters started to ooze and get worse. I could not sleep, I could not shower as it hurt me so much. I called and reported this to the clinic, they told me not to worry. I was worried, I went to a specialist dermatologist in Berlin Germany and was told I had severe burns and would result in permanent scarring. I wrote my own demand letter to the clinic and was told Malti O'Mahoney would discuss it with me. On the phone she agreed it was bad and she agreed I deserved some compensation and that they had in fact burnt me. They never offered anything as I was told she needed to speak with the owner, subsequently I found out that was her husband James O'Mahoney and he decided that he did not want to discuss compensation. I got in touch with a man who was not even legal to practice in UK as he was not active but acting as their solicitor and HE ACTUALLY ADVISED ME to get a solicitor telling me his client was not cooperating. From 2006-2016 this has dragged on. I was awarded 524,758.93 UK Sterling for my injuries and losses. I have permanent scarring up and down my legs and have to follow a regimen to try and conceal this. If you check the history of Boston Clinic (UK) Ltd and Boston Clinic UK Ltd and now Harley Street Treatments and other names you will see that they have consistently changed their name and dissolved their company with Companies House, which is a joke, to evade this judgement, and presumably other debts and possibly even judgements as their history of changing name and dissolving and re-emerging is so constant. In fact though they never even attended one hearing or defended their actions yet they tried to dissolve themselves mid proceedings and re-form under a slight variation of their name, this was later forced by the courts to be reinstated but to no help to me. Though my solicitors have tried to collect the damages I was awarded in the judgement, they have been unsuccessful as the defendant, James O'Mahoney and his wife Malti O'Mahoney and their accountant, Peter Grant, who at the time was a director and destroyed all relevant documents, all ran away from their responsibilities and accountability for their clinic.  Instead of taking accountability in any form they just dissolve and reform their company over and over, AND I WILL STAY ON TOP OF THAT AND WARN ANYONE I CAN to stay clear of them and make sure you get their medical mal practice insurance details and ensure they have them if you do dare go here for any treatment. Quite simply, James Anthony O'Mahoney and Malti O'Mahoney and Peter Grant got away with permanently maiming me and until they pay their debt as ordered by the court, or they cease to exist I will do my best to ensure nobody go through what I had to go through. This is a rogue business and sadly allowed by Companies House to continue to operate and change their name on a regular basis. Footnote: In May 2016 they were forced into insolvency and dissolved and now rather than Harley Street Treatments Limited they are Harley Street Treatments Ltd and now the director is listed as Peter Anthony Grant once again. STAY AWAY FROM HARLEY STREET TREATMENTS."
516,1,"Had a facelift 9 months ago with Dr. Jan Zemplenyi, Bellevue, WA.  My facelift results are horrific.  Part of my ear (the tragus) was completely cut off on one side and instead of doing a fat grafting procedure which he suggested doing because my face was thin, he removed part of my buccal (cheek) fat or tissue creating a large divot on my cheek which causes my face on one side to look like a skeleton.  He pulled one side of my face extremely tight and left one side loose and saggy. I have contacted him to try to get my money of $9,800 back so that I can use it to hopefully have a facial plastic surgeon help me with this disfigurement, as I saved all that money on that facelift and that was my savings.  He was very defensive towards me every time I came in, saying things like, Just be glad you are thin, then he admitted that he pulled the left side of my face tighter than the right because he is left-handed, I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  It has been 9 months of sheer pain and self-consciousness.  He charged me more for a slight revision which did not help, then charged an additional $1,175 for injections to try to fix these hollows.  He was neglectful, and I had to go to my PMD to get antibiotics for an infection that occurred in my ear from the facelift.  When I complained of pain on that ear, he injected me with Kenalog.  He has made my life unbearable and I have written him letters wanting my money back that are just ignored.  Do not trust your face with this Dr. Jan Zemplenyi, I look so much worse than I could have ever imagined."

During my post op care they completely ignored me. They gave me no resolution or outcome. my stomached is uneven, one side is larger than the other.

518,1,"This is the first negative posting I have ever done before on the internet against a business, but I hate to warn other physicians and nurses about the company and the information. I am board certified internist and just attended the Los Angeles botox Course offered by aesthetic medical educators. The Aesthetics Medical Educators Training program is hands down the absolute worst course I have ever attended in my entire life! My partner said I should check out a company called esiw but they had bad reviews also, I think anything would have been better. I paid almost $2,000 dollars for this course! I am so upset and trying to get my money back. For $2,000, if you can believe I had to print out my own materials and bring them to the course! NO handout, no manual!!! I should have known at that point that the course was a scam but the website looked good and I made the mistake. I expected quality hand outs, print materials, charts, whatever, not a short black and white copy of a power point presentation. After the course I went back read that if you want a manual you have to pay an extra $50, I have never heard of a company charging $50 for a book that is supposed to come with the class. And then, they state that they are just being friendly to the environment They must think their readers are stupid! I guess I am for registering for this class. I want to report this company to some agency I don't know who or how but I will find out. The instructor who taught the class should not have been teaching. I would have expected a plastic surgeon or at least some high level Aesthetics physician. The instructor knew very little about the course material and probably never performed these techniques in private practice either. (This however, I cannot stat for certain. Its just that the quality of training was so basic that there is no way the instructor could be doing this in practice). If I had stayed home and watched a YouTube video I probably would have learned more. I can write for another hour but I have to stop somewhere. The hand on was a complete kole. I practiced very little and I’m not even sure what this company is doing is legal because they are charging their patients for procedures and there is not established physician patient relationship, the set up was unorganized, they violated every HIPPA law, osha, biohazard conditions, and quite frankly, I felt very uncomfortable being at this program as if it were run by NON MEDICAL PEOPLE who know nothing about practicing medicine, a little scary."
519,1,"I am physician from Dallas and attended an IAPAM symposium where I was supposed to learn everything in Aesthetics, Botox, Filler, Lasers, IIPL, Weight Loss, and more over a 4 day period.  I think it’s called International Association of Physicians in Aesthetics Medicine. Class was disorganized, poorly setup, the teaching was very sloppy, the instructor was not a specialist and he knew very little about Aesthetics. Some of the testimonials they posted are fake, I researched the testimonials and found that some are new accounts, no pictures, no content, and were recently set up accounts just to make the post. When the instructor was asked basic questions about topics that were not on the slides he was talking about, he was lost. The other physicians in the class looked at each other in awe after they heard some of the ridiculous answers they gave. I am so upset and angry that I spent a great deal of money on tuition and travel and not to mention the time I lost away from my practice. The laser part was promotional for different products-laser- equipment, etc. I have since researched and learned that to properly learn about laser, most training companies I have found devote 1-2 full days. It is that hard to provide a quality training program!  Hands on part was poorly setup with little no supervision. I practiced on my own but watched other doctors standing around doing nothing. Sorry for them. Only the complainers, like myself had any opportunity to actually inject. The sterile techniques was nonexistent and the class set up was dangerous, at best. If you are not outgoing or outspoken, I doubt you will have a chance to even hold a syringe.  Total waste of time and money. I am trying to get a refund but I doubt that will happen. Total Rip Off, Total Scam. "
520,1,"I chose to go with Dr. Young because it appears that he is double board certified. Also after observing my nose he was very confident that he could fix it.  This was my fourth nose surgery and it was a full reconstructive surgery using rib cartaledge.  Dr. Young claims that he has all the same training as the leading nose surgeons in the world. Two other things sealed the deal for me.  First, his price was pretty good compared to other private surgens, $7,800 total $4,400 going straight to him.  Now, having 3 previous failed surgery’s I knew quite well the possibility of failure.  So I asked him what would happen if the surgery failed and how long it would take to know.  He said if the surgery failed that he would refund his cut ($4,400) and it would take about a year after the surgery to tell if it was successful or not. The surgery took him four hours longer than he said it would (10 to 11 hours total).  He was supposed to collect the rib cartilage via a 1/4 inch incision under my pectoral muscle like good surgeons do.  Instead, he cuts a 2 to 2 1/2 inch incision straight through my top left abdominal muscle.  Recovering from this was more painful than the nose reconstruction itself. When he took the bandage off my nose it was HUGE.  I mean I looked scary.  I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror.  The swelling has gone down a lot since then, but my nose is still very big and bulky.  The tip of my nose is a big glob of cartilage, the right side of the nose is lower than the left side.  Here I am a year and a half later and my nose looks worse than before the surgery. I asked Dr. Young for a refund and he says he never said anything about giving me a refund.  However, he would like to continue to help me by doing another surgery.  I told him that I would not let him do another surgery on me if he paid me 8 grands. Dr. Young has no talent as a nose surgeon.  His talent is in deception.  Out of the four surgeons he is by far the worst.  I urge you to stay far away from this wolf in sheep’s clothing."
521,1,"SCAMMERS!!!!! Do NOT go to Perfect Body in Bayshore NY. They handed me loads of paperwork and told me to promptly fill everything out without explaining what it was that I was filling out and why? I assumed I was to fill the paper work out about my health history and personal information (name, address, etc.). Later, to find out that without my permission they ran my personal information for a credit application!!!! What I had filled out was not for their medical records BUT to scam me!!! I later received the reply for the credit application via mail! Which was a total shock to me considering I had only went in for a consultation to learn about the procedure! I immediately called Perfect Body and the only response I got from them was I'm sorry, but you should have read the (dictionary load) of paper work they told me they needed for their medical records. Inconclusion, Please avoid these scam artist. They are only out for the money as I have read nothing but terrible terrible reviews about them! BEWARE!!"
522,1,"I'm a physician with several years of experience, but unfortunately the state of the medical industry today leaves me no option but to resort to aesthetics to supplement my practice's income. That's when I came across the ESI or Esthetic Skin Institute, and I can't begin to tell how much I regret ever coming across this company. It is one of the most fraudulent experience I have had in all my years in medicine. To begin with the course I attended (a Botox Training course) was one of the most superficial incomplete and useless courses I ever attended, us students barely got to train the hands on injections like it was promised, which is one of the main unique selling points they say they have. A lot of the information was never included on the course, and I feel like they did this to force us to attend more classes with them. The teacher, Herb de Souza, didn't feel confident in what he was teaching and I didn't get confident about him either. The course material was garbage, and it seemed copied from somewhere else. I feel like I was caught in some sort of pyramid scheme, with this esthetic skid institute. This is the first time I have written anything bad about the company but wasting almost a thousand dollars on this joke of a course, I feel like it is my duty to help my colleagues not to get caught by this fraudulent company and waste their money too. This company is a shame to all healthcare providers, do not waste your money with them."

525,1,"Rt. 51 Homes are scam artist. They make it sound like everything is perfect with their mobile homes. They sell Marlette Schult mobile homes. I have nothing but problems with this company. This company is a bunch of scam artists. They refuse to take any kind of responsibility for any unfinished work, damaged items, or warranty items needing fixed. They are very good about getting out of fixing their mistakes. Just a couple examples: 1. Unfinished trim work that needed fixed was done very poorly. We still have cracks in the ceiling that still haven't been fixed. Another example 2. Carpeting that is not tacked down completely or lined up correctly. They still haven't fixed it, excuse is that they fired the guy who does the carpeting. 3. Frozen water pipes because they never plugged in the heating wrap. Reason, they didn't have to plug it in because they installed the home in the summer months. They never told us this at that time so we assumed that it was plugged in and working. Excuse is that it is stated in the manual that they do not have to plug it in. We have never seen this so called manual...the one that they provided for us doesn't state this issue. ...they called and harassed my aunt, with an unlisted number, to find out what was going on in our mobile home. This company is very slippery and gets out of doing anything that they are responsible for. They can't talk big when they get into trouble then they never open their mouths. This company stinks and is scamming a lot of people who have no clue what they are capable of doing. No one has the guts to stand up to them. We are, and they are getting ticked off. They haven't seen anything yet. There are many more issues to report, not enough space."

527,1,"First of all I can not believe why is this company still allowed to operate considering the huge amount of people complaining their poor service. Basically, this company extracts the money from your account immediately after you place the order instead of the moment they ship your product. Then they promise delivery times maximum of 15 days when in fact they took 40 (!) days just to start the shipment process. The moment I am writing this report I still did not receive the product and it's been already 40 days since order placement. 5 days ago, after the order did not have any status change (still waiting for courier dispatch...) I decided to cancel the order and ask for a refund. Coincidence or not, 3 days later that responded that it was no longer possible to proceed with the refund since it was already in the hands of the delivery company (DHL) which is not true since the status still appeared as waiting for courier dispatch 2 days after the refund request. Just yesterday dis the status changed and effectively a DHL delivery number was created. This company should be BANNED. Please put them out of business. They give internet commerce a bad name."
528,1,"Hong Kong Alifan Electronic is a fraud! My dear friend have recently purchased some 32gb cards which were charge 6 dollars a piece from this company. While they were making the deal, this lady Lisa also agree to send extra 25 pieces as a gift to first time buyer. However, when he received the products, although all the cards will shown as 32GB when he inserted in the computer, but it all turned out to be 2GB only. Also, even though the shipping label and everything was written as 100 pieces, there were only 75 pieces that he received. When he decided to contact the lady Lisa who's in charge, she called him an idiot to think that he could use such a cheap price to get such high quality products! And insisted that she did not lie. My friend has asked and confirmed if the cards are 32GB before he purchased them. Moreover, when we finally come close to making a deal to have the money returned, she requested to have ALL 100 PIECES back, included the 25 pieces which were never received. So he told her that he have contacted her before and told her that he never received that 25 pieces. Instantly, she got extremely mad and started yelling! She insisted that if we do not have all 100 pieces, she will not make any deal unless he agree to have the money taken off from that 25 pieces which appears to be missing. On top of that, she was trying to take money off from shipping, services and such, which leaves only almost a dollar back for each piece instead of all 6 dollars! Until this day, we have not yet receive any money back. So please stay away from this company. I personally checked their website. Even though their company names appeared to be in hong kong, her location is actually in Shenzhen china. It was not a hong kong company! Also, I have had someone to go to the addresses they have on the Internet, both in hong kong and china. There weren't such company in that exact address! Moreover, when you entered their website, its all in English, although it appears to have a Chinese version, the link was not found when you clicked on it. So I am more than certain that this company is a fraud! All they do is pretend to be an organized company in hong kong to cheat foreigner’s money!!!!"

I'm like what I didn't break it it stop working why do I have to pay again I bought the unit new. There like we can't help you. Ask for a mgr of course he not in when will he be Ava we don't know so u only have one mgr. Yes no one too deal with these matters. But him right yup.

531,2,"Back in November of 2006 I purchased a Philips Plasma TV for $1300.  Two months after purchasing, the plasma screen went, and a signal board went in it.  Both were covered by the warranty. There are 4 major components in this TV and 2 of them went in the first 2 months of use. All was fine up until September 2009, just under 3 years after purchasing.  I began getting the dreaded 6-3 error code.  the logic board bad died and needed to be replaced.  I had it replaced at a cost of $350 for the part and $70 for the service call. Fast forward 5 months.  I am getting the 6-3 error code again.  The logic board has broken again and that part only comes with a 90 day warranty.  So I essentially threw $350 away the last time I had the TV repaired.  Philips refuses to replace the $350 5 month old part.   My personal feeling is a $350 part should last longer than 5 months and a $1300 TV should last longer than 3 years.  But Philips feels otherwise.  They refuse to stand behind their products.  From what I understand, Philips was having so many problems with these TV's, thousands and thousands of failures, that they stopped producing them.   I am told that they don't even make the parts anymore.  I could understand that one if the TV was 20 years old, but it is only 3. So the Broken Philips Plasma TV has not been repaired as I am not too keen on shelling out another $350 to fix a TV that May or may not last another 5 months. I have an option.  Fix the Philips or buy a new one. I purchased a new PANASONIC Tv over the weekend.  I am done with the Philips brand.  I am not sure how Philips expects to stay in business if they keep alienating their customer base as I am not alone with this same problem.  May be Philips knows something I do not."

This was disturbing since they allowed only 7 days to claim a prize that they didn't even notify me that I had won. When I queried their tech support I received no response - except being blocked from my account today. In other words, I'm now being denied access to a service I paid for a month in advance.

533,3,"Before my brother in law went on vacation, he and myself went to Frys Electronic to buy a 55 inches TV. After buying it, I set it up for him, but he did not have chance to watch it, because he was busy for his vacation. When he came back, he recognized that the TV was small, therefore, we came back store to ask Customer Service if we can return and buy a bigger one. One of customer service looked at my receipt and told me that it has passed 30 days, so he can not accept return for refund, but he will accept for store credit. Next day, we packed it up and brought to store to have a bigger one, We met one of manager at customer service, we told her about that the situation and we want to return our TV for store credit as one of their customer service told us a day before. The manager kept asking who was the manager in previous day, I said I don't know but she kept asking about the previous manager in very rude voice. I said I don't care who was the manager, and I don’t want to know  who was the manager, I just came to ask their customer service and they said yes, therefore, I come back to return or exchange our TV, why do I care about who was the manager, and then she declined and said she won't accept return because it passed 30 days. I don't care about their 30 days or not, the problem is when we came to store to asked if we can return it, and one of their customer service said yes with store credit, therefore, we packed up our TV to bring in for return.

538,2,"About a year ago we opened a very small video rental business in Greeley, Colorado. It was our first time doing business and was learning everything as we go. We received a flyer through the mail from Electronic Business Solutions, Inc. at our business location shortly after we registered the business and started setting up the storefront. The flyer was for a credit card acceptance machine (terminal). One of the representative / owner, Curt Hollis, called us shortly after to see if we were interested in having the machine set up in our store. At first we were reluctant since we did not know what the nature of the customers in the area were like, but after talking to the representative and reading over the flyer we decided to meet with him. We asked Mr. Hollis many questions, especially regarding the terms of the contract, he assured us several times that the lease contract was cancelable at any time. The flyer also states that there is, No contracts. Even though the lease agreement we signed after the terminal was set up said that it was non-cancelable. When we asked him this he said that it was a formality to have that on the contract. He said that if the credit card terminal does not help increase our sales we could cancel the contract at any time and that he would just pick up the machine and give it to another business and we would no longer be responsible for the lease nor the credit card machine (terminal). Three months after we had the credit card terminal in our store it was more of an expense then a profit for us to have it around. As we discovered, very few of our customers had credit cards, thus we decided it was inefficient to have the machine or the service in our store. Since about July of 2004 we have been trying to contact the Electronic Business Solutions, Inc just about every other day. We finally gave up after reporting him to the Better Business Bureau in Colorado Springs Colorado. They did not have any success in receiving a reply to the letters that they sent to the company's representative/owner, Curt Hollis, either. This company has approximately twelve complaints against them according to the BBB. Around September of 2004 when we called once more to Electronic Business Solutions, Inc., we were able to speak with one of Curt Hollis employees. We explained the situation to him and he assured us that we were now on the list to have the machine transferred. That was over 8 months ago since we had any contact with the company and now we cannot even get a hold of anyone in his office. We have talked directly with the leasing agent, Allied Financial Investments, Inc. They said that they understood our misfortune, but refuses to accept responsibility for their subcontractor / representative business practices. We are at a point where we are feeling hopeless and that there is nothing we can do. As of April 30, 2005, we have closed our business, but we still have this issue that we have to deal with.

When we opened the box, the cd software was broken, I returned that same day, in the afternoon, and asked for a new cd-rw. They told me it was there last in stock but what they were going to do was order the software. The software was going to take 24-48 hours. I told the owner I was concerned that if the software was broken that the cd-rw may be damaged, the ownwer whose name is Micheal says don't worry we will take care of you if that is the case. Four days later, no software. I had to call them and they in turn said they were going to call the company again. I called the company and received the software in 3 days. Finally, we installed the software and the cd-rw could not be picked up by the computer. I called the company and they told me that the cd-rw was defective and needed to be returned. I called Micheal and he said that they would order a new one and it would take 2 days. A week passed and I was fed up. I called and the owner couldn't be found and his employees didn't have a number to get in touch with him. I left messages to relay my message of wanting a refund because i was not happy with the quality or service. Finally, on Oct.5, I spoke with Micheal over the phone and he said the product was in and that he wouldn't give me a refund. I said I was going in to see it. I arrived, the owner was gone, and the product was not the same cd-rw that I had purchased. I left very upset. What I tried to do was get someone a special present and it has turned into a present form hell. Now I have a defective product and it seems like there is nothing I could do."
540,3,"My Whirlpool washing machine has not worked properly from the first day. Whirlpool washing machine customer care is pathetic. I bought a Whirlpool semi-automatic washing machine, Sparkle. This product is in warranty period. From the first day, this product did not give right result. Machine sound is very high and I called customer care center may times (around 9-10 times). They sent this machine three times in service center but the results remained the same. The problem arose when we put some load in it. He said the gear box should be changed and the machine should be cleansed off the dirt. He offered some powder costing Rs. 1500/- to be used in washing machine.
Later, he asked Rs. 350/- for other parts after two months then I paid them again after 15 days for a piece that did not work. Then, they want to charge me Rs. 350/- again. When I showed the previous slip, they then changed that part without any cost. But after 15 days, again same problem occurred. They charged me 150/- Rs. but the problem is the same. Total money I spent is Rs. 1500/-+350/-+150/-. I also purchased a stand and cover for safety, but what will happen if product is not good? The technicians visited many times and they all said this piece is not okay but they can't do anything. The company should change this product. The machine is still rotting at my home. I'm not sure if it could be accepted to be exchanged for a new one.
Customer care gave us the satisfaction code but technician did not ask for this code. I'm really very sad that I have called around 10 complaints within two years. Why are you people not listening? You all are doing time pass. You can check my complaint codes in your records and ask your technicians about Noida. Many times, I did not note the complaints number. Please open my file and check the issue. I told the technician many times that I want to talk to your seniors and want to tell them the problem because from the first day, it was the same, but they refused. I have also purchased a 320 LT fridge from you but that product is very nice. I hope this company will offer me a better service next time."
541,1,"I ordered the product, one part did not work, after emailing them and not hearing back I went it back fed-ex, did not hear back.  Ordered some of their cartridges on line stated if you order over $100 there is free shipping but the shipping charge would not come off so I went and called instead.  Received a wrong item and sent it back UPS, now they tell me they received both but I must send them shipping fee for the items (which I had been charged with the original order) and then order way over my 2nd order to avoid this and then had to pay shipping fees over $25 just to prove that I sent the items back.  I have no guarantee that I will get the right order and I feel that this could continue forever.  The phone they have keeps you on hold forever and half the time disconnects you after 15 minutes when on hold.  When you get someone they don't help they just say that's our policy??  There is no customer service as they are truly not helpful they were very good and calling me every day when I started to place my order on line but stopped when I saw a problem.  They called me every other day to see if I was able to place my order.  Something is seriously wrong with this company and they need to be stopped!!!!!!!!!"
542,1,"EPS and it's employees are bad for your business! Long story short, EPS has been ripping us off for 7 full years.  (Yes, shame on us!) Overcharged for terminal rental-instead, look for a company that will let you lease to own, or at least explain in plain terms that you will be paying for old outdated equipment for years and years! Fees are not competitive.  Lots of merchant service co's out there with lower rates! Customer service is extremely rude and does not provide service, just references to your contract while lying to you. Contract terms are unreasonable, even after 6 years, your contract will not allow you to cancel any time you wish.  Lots of other co's have a month to month after 1 year of service.  Our current co will allow us to cancel any time.  In Feb 2009, we realized EPS had been charging us a terminal rental fee that when totaled up over 6 years since our contract began in 2003 was 5x the purchase price of a new terminal.  We also realized at that time they were just not competitive enough with their fees and rates to continue doing business with them. If they were a reputable and smart business, at that point they would have offered to give us the 6 year old terminal with a big thank you for your business and for overpaying us for the use of the terminal for the past 6 years.   They might have kept our business.  But, instead, an employee got short verbally over the phone when asked about the obvious disparity in the fees we'd paid and the price of the old terminal, and when she was told we wished to terminate their services (7 years), she got even nastier, and informed us that our contract automatically renewed every September for an entire year.  So, we could no terminate as we wished.  There was no Sorry to see you go, are you sure there is nothing we can do?  So much for good business and excellent public relations... She then LIED, (sorry, but I can't really minimize this to say she mis-spoke, which seems to be the new PC term for lying!), and stated that a written request to terminate the contract would not be accepted until we were within 90 days of renewal.   That was in Feb, and our renewal month was September.  I went over the requirements carefully with her, and she told me to write the letter after July 1st.  At that time, we had no reason not to believe her, and alas, we did not look at our contract, or we would have realized the lie right away, and discovered that the written request was to be received before 90 days of renewal date.   So, then we put up with their monthly charge being withdrawn from our checking account every month, and waited until July to send in the written request, (which was sent certified mail) for terminating our contract in September, 2009.  But, after taking the Sept fee out of our account, we were told tough luck, you should have read your contract.  So, of course, we were then ripped off for an additional $505 for the next year.  This tactic, or twisting of verbiage is, we feel, something their agents may actually be trained to say, so that people are mislead into carrying another full year complete with annual and monthly charges above their competitors.  This is how they are able to stay in business, by making it so hard to terminate them, that they just take money out of their customers accounts instead of truly competing for business. Please beware, as always, the world is not what it used to be, and is full of outfits like EPS.  You must carefully read everything you sign, but most especially with these charlatans!"
543,2,"I went to fry's store in Renton, Washington in September to buy blank blueray disks and wireless keyboard which were the sale items advertised on their website. I was going to pay with cash because they were around $28 something. But the sales person told me that I had to use fry's card to place an order at the store and pick up at the counter because they were required card number to hold items. I didn't want to argue with the sales person, so I used their computer to order. So I ended up having to use fry's card for this small purchase. Couple months passed, I received the bill from First Electronic Bank regarding this purchase and noticed there is a $10.00 late charge and $.50 interest. So I called the bank, and talked to the customer service rep. to get this charges waived. She told me this account is past due and without saying to me transferred me to the collection department. So I explained to the collection agent that payment could not be made because I didn't receive the first bill and asked the late charge and interest should be waived. Collection agent kept saying to me the statement was mailed out in Oct. so this late and interest charges are valid, so she can't waive this. She kept saying this is not their error so the charge is valid, and I kept saying this is not my error either because simply I didn't receive the first bill. Even though the mistake was not made by me, I realized that getting these charges waived was impossible. And also the experience to deal with these bank employees was the worst I can remember now. Maybe they are trained not to be very nice so the customers could easily give up like me. Not only for the reason I have to give them $10 or so additionally but also the attitude the bank employees showed me, I am really angry. Anyways I came to a conclusion not to use this card anymore."
544,2,"I recently opened and account with Fry's Electronics and obtained a credit card from their store. When I received the card I realized it was not issued by Fry's Corporation but by First Electronic Bank of Draper, Utah. When a payment was due I tried to sign onto their website to pay it.  Unfortunately, I could not register onto the site.  My accountant could not register onto the site. Finally after several days of attempting to get it right I worked on the phone with the person who answered the 800 number and got registered. Now my payment is again due.  I cannot Sign On to the site.  Repeated attempts using every variation of passwords could not get me on site.  No one answered the phone, Fry's told me to call FEB during business hours.  I could not sign onto the site yet somehow they knew I was attempting to sign on because they blocked any further attempts an notified me that I could not sign in and would have to contact them on the phone that never gets answered. In the mean time during this entire process my due date came and went. Penalties and a mark on my credit record. As a consumer I demand proper service from someone who wants my business. First Electronic Bank, a subsidiary of Fry's charges 25% interest and manipulates users into default conditions.  They do not respond to repeated contact attempts and basically just don't give a *&^% about the people they are supposed to be serving. I am closing out my account and paying them in full (If I can ever get in contact with them).I will not do business with them or their parent Corporation (Fry's Electronics)  Worst company I have ever dealt with the exception of Sears but that is another story."
545,1,"Like many of your subscribers, I found out too late that I was a victim of the PRADO free offer scam. I'm one of those people that wants to quit smoking and the PRADO ad seemed a fairly reasonable offer.....free trial for the cost of shipping. I placed my order and next day I start getting phone calls for refills. I flat out said no. During the ordering process I repeatedly was offered more and more options which I declined. I noticed that my bank statement showed a charge for $149.50...no way could I've spent that on the E-CIG! I called the number for customer service to complain and was told that I had14 days to cancel my account and that I had not fully read the Terms of the agreement. This is a flat-out scam and a perfect example of misleading advertisement. I would like to join anybody in taking legal action against PRADO and to end their questionable advertisement."
546,1,"Saw pop-up on computer for PRADO Electronic Cigarette, just pay shipping.  THAT'S NOT what they do.  They will call you back after the order, with other offers.  The terms do explain that you will be charged $149.90 if you do not send it back within 14 days, but, if you do not read the terms all the way through, it will cost you... The 14 days starts with your order. Also, if you use more than 2 refills, each one over 2 will cost $5 each if, you sent it back.  A TOTAL RIP OFF.   The refills taste like crap.  Not worth it, don't fall for this SCAM!!  I am working with my bank to get my money back.  Called the company, and they are willing to refund $100, if I accept the $29.95 refills.  Then I have to call back to stop the shipments. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS CRAP. "

548,2,"We have a Customer's Cadillac here that we diagnosed with a faulty ECM. I wanted to By-Pass the dealer and get an ECM from another source other than GM. I found Automotive Electronic Solutions on the internet and gave them a call explaining that I needed an ECM diagnosed and if it is indeed bad, replaced and programmed. I was assured by the Pathologist (Is that even a real word?) that they have the ability to load a remanufactured ECM with the factory Cadillac software no problem.  I Received a call from AES telling me that the ECM was bad, they are going to send out a replacement already programmed and ready to go, just have to plug it in and go. I received the ECM, plugged it in, Engine will not crank. The ECM that I received does not have the proper coding for the Cadillac alarm system. I had the car towed to a GM dealer for alarm programming for $108.00, engine did start but now we have a Check engine light on.  Car never had a check engine lamp prior to ECM failure.  The code we were getting is a code for the MAF sensor not detecting proper voltage. We probed the wires to the MAF, we have good voltage from MAF to the ECM input connector, no voltage reference on the output connector, Scanner reads zero volts for MAF.  I called their Tech support hotline and they logged my call. That was 7 days ago, I called back the same day and a rather rude guy basically told me that they will get back to me when they want to. I then had the sinking feeling that I just got screwed. Not to mention that my customer has been out of a car for a month now. I have now ordered a genuine ECM from GM and will once again have the dealer program it. These guys will not return your calls, will not help you after the sale at all. These guys sounded too good to be true (preprogrammed ECM and just plug it in!) Just another BS company that takes your dollars and then forgets all about you the customer. I lost my on this job and now I have an unhappy customer because of this company and I'll never use them again."

550,1,"I purchased a GPS handheld from Fry's here in Austin and was talked into buying an extended warranty because the sales guy told me that it would cover physical damage while the manufacturer one would not, so like a fool I believed him and bought it, lo and behold the GPS gets a very small crack (which yes I caused) but when I went back, I was told the warranty did not cover physical damage, and sure enough it did not, so while this may not be a true rip off don’t believe fry's if your told that an extended warranty cover minor physical damage, it does not and is probably NOT worth buying. I best it was an honest mistake a worst it was a ripoff... in either case I will NEVER EVER buy an extended warranty from Fry's ever again, I am thinking about filing a report with the BBB as I am sure they have salesmen selling extended warranties with the promise that it covers physical damage."

Naturally I would send them back to them, but they would have the nerve to want to bill me. last spring I had it up to here with them so I payed what I had owed them and canceled my membership. Now recently I have I new bill stating that I owe them $90.00 Which I haven't heard from these people in many months.

553,3,"I have been paying monthly for my son’s trumpet from Music Center, now apparently bought out by the Music & Arts. So earlier in the month I received in invoice from the new company stating I was 3 months behind (pause… breathe… incorrect) so I called and spoke with a nice woman initially who said that account info was being transferred so it may take a few more weeks for my payments to appear on their records. I said ok I will call next week to make a payment. It was a pleasant conversation, hung up, felt ok. I call yesterday to see if everything transferred over and to make my payment, another rep stated that I had made a payment on 05/02/18 $35 charge and $96 on 05/16/18. (PAUSE) I didn’t make either payment. So I explained that I haven’t made ANY payments to the new company so how did they receive a payment? Who authorized said payment(s)? Riddle me this Batman. Now we have a problem. I am not on a direct draft, I pay with my debit card monthly that is not kept on file… or so I thought. The rep was extremely unhelpful, so I asked for a manager, who surprisingly was unavailable at the moment and would return my phone call in 24-48 hours. Immediately hung up the phone and called the local store. Spoke with the sweetest gentleman who mentioned he had worked with Music Center for 38 years prior to the acquisition. I explained what happened and he was apologetic but said he was unable to assist because he TOO had to call the same customer service department. I informed him this is why people do not deal with big companies and prefer small, local businesses. He also mentioned that Quite a few people have been calling about the company. (Wonder why?) Fast forward this morning, hubs texts me and asks if I used the cc for a payment…. Nope… But now I wonder, was it for Music & Arts? Yes. Impossible lol How did they get that credit card number? Never used it to make payments. So, he calls…. Again, no direct response except the one possibility, “Someone must have purchased an instrument?”. And yes, the Manager was again unavailable. She tells him to dispute it with the bank lol (Superior customer service). At no point did she ask his name, phone number, account associated. So, he hangs up and calls the bank and puts in a claim. Big corporations buy smaller ones in these silent acquisitions and decide take advantage of their local clients.    "

My money has not been refunded, there isn't any address or phone number to contact them. They still have my credit card information and the bank suggests I close my account to avoid future charges.

Just before the deal was closed I asked for photos of the guitar and they sent just the ones i asked for: serial number etc. So they did really have the guitar in stock. The first payment was returned to my bank, according to Max Music due to account problems. So they gave me a new Central Bank of Asia account number. This time the transfer was accepted, however there has been a radio silence since (more than a month ago). They do not reply on my mail. I warned them that I would go public, so here it is.   Do not buy from Max Musics Store! "
556,3,"Music Today has provided very poor services to me and many other members of Xposed, an official Fan club of Christina Aguilera. The website states that the membership includes a welcome package, exclusive monthly contests and give-aways, and Xposed newsletters, along with a few other things. First off is the welcome package. Music Today has been managing Xposed for around 11 months now. We still haven't received our welcome packages, which were said to include a signed photo of Christina, a fan letter, and a mousepad. This was posted back in July, and still we've got nothing. Second are the exclusive monthly contests. Out of the 11 months Music Today has been running Xposed, we've had 5 contests. You must be 18 years of age and a legal US resident to be eligible to participate, which is not stated before paying and joining Xposed. The latest contest, titled Christina's Fan Appreciation Contest, is open even to non-members of Xposed. Members pay for a yearly membership, but non-members are getting the same benefits, even when the majority of the members are either under 18 and international members. This isn't very fair to paying members. We've also received very few, if any, Xposed newsletters. As you can clearly see, Music Today is misleading people who join Xposed, and providing very poor services. They keep saying to give it time since they had to basically start from scratch after they took over after Fans Rule, but it's been almost a year now, and we're still having the same problems we had in the beginning. Something drastic needs to be done, and soon before they start losing customers."

558,1,"Marsk Music is a company involved in promotion and management of artists in the music industry.  They plan and arrange tours in EU for artists.  Marsk Music has lied about offers from venues in order to extort money from the artist I manage in the USA.  After a recent tour in Scandinavia, I found out that the venues paid the promoter 50-67% over what I was told the offers were.  Marsk Music charged excessive commissions and expenses out of the artist's low pay, then kept thousands of US dollars over what my artist was paid.  We believe these funds are being taken in an effort to evade paying Denmark's high tax rate.  We also found that several of the venues are involved in this conspiracy, taking a cut of the money stolen from the artists.  This has been reported to the Danish Tax Authority and to the Danish police, but so far, nothing has happened to the company/owner.  He uses his tax free income that he steals from his artists to buy Ferrari's and vintage sports cars.  I uncovered a major tax evasion conspiracy in Denmark in which Marsk Music uses artists to steal, not only from the artists themselves, but from the Danish government.  We are hoping justice will prevail eventually.  This company has stolen/extorted at least $100,000 from my artist alone.  He has over 50 artists on his website roster.   That is a lot of money!   So far, most people just think we are disgruntled and insane, but with 2 conflicting invoices for the last tour, neither being correct, it is not only suspicious but criminal."

561,3,I originally signed up for 1 year of Yahoo Music song sharing service for $60 per year on my Capital One credit card. During this time I moved to CA and attempted to cancel this credit card and lost track of this acct. Yahoo Music then charged me for another year of this service (phone # 800-318-0631) at 2x the original price or $119.88 for another year of service with no prior notification to me. When I called to request a refund since I no longer want the service and did not agree to paying 2x the original price they refused to refund my account. They only agreed to lower the status of my account from sharing music to only listening to music on my pc for $60 per year with an additional $1 per burning a CD. This downgraded service would be of no use to me since I could no longer share songs on my MP3 player. When I called Yahoo Music (1-800-318-0631) they said it was company policy to not refund their customers even in the case they change their price without prior notification. I believe their business practice is deceitful and would appreciate your assistance in this matter. Please contact me by email for further information.

I was surprised by the charge because there was no notice prior to them billing my card. They did not even send notice that they had even billed my credit card. What was even more surprising is that they had substantially raised the price of the annual service and again with no notice. Yahoo Customer Service is poor. I went to the Yahoo Music website and I found no information on contacting customer service. No link by email or phone. I did a search on the internet and found another customer who had posted the phone number in their blog (this person also had a similar problem). I called the 866 number and spoke with the billing dept. and they just kept putting me on hold, but kept coming back with special offers that they would discount the price if I would not cancel. If I cancelled then they would not do anything for me. I told them that I did not authorize the charge, the price increase and was never sent an invoice telling me of the actual annual charges. I cought the charge days from when they billed me for the upcoming year yet they were not willing to let me cancel. STAY AWAY from this DECEITFUL company. After dealing with this company it has become apparent that they do not communicate with there customers about billing as they hope customers will stay with the service and not notice the large price increases which are automatically charged for the following years of service."
563,1,To all the people who like to play by the rules here is one for you; Snappy-Music convinced me that this was a legal music download site but all it is people charging for limewires software. I was under the impression that I would be charged $1.99 a month and not all at once for two years. They are sure fast at taking the money out of your account but they don't have time to contact you. I called the number and everyone is right they don't answer and then I tried e-mailing them and that didn't work either. There is no way to contact this company.
564,1,FAKE OPPORTUNITIES! I recently submited for a opportunity to place my music in a major network show. I got a response saying it was being considered by a music sup on the show. I informed a friedn whom worked at that network. She then checked the status. They had not even received my song and noone by that name EVER worked on that show! After this incident I contacted Music Xray and informed them of my feedback from the real network people. They saidthe person miss informed them. They lie about the credibility of all the opporunities and people's postions that offer them. Music Xray is a SCAM! They should be sued for all the money they take from artist with no real possibilities of success.
565,1,"This company took advantage of the fact that we used their RLIAB (record label in a box) to get over on us.  We thought they would be honest rather than deceptive with their practices.  We asked for their team to help us break our record in the UK as well as get a competitive edge in the international market.  They took advantage of our team's lack of understanding the international market in order to fatten their pockets.  In fact, Maya Battles was very deceptive in her promises.  She lead us to believe that we would be getting help from their department.  Instead they made us pay all of this money, and we were obligated to do the marketing ourselves.  We were required to spend almost $10K and we do not have anything to show for it.  She and Ditto Music should have been honest and told us they do not know how to market Hip Hop Music, and they are unfamiliar with marketing these type of records.  We saw they do not have the knowledge nor the skill-set to accomplish our goals.  That's why we asked for a refund.  They made us pay for a month of service and they did not do any work. We should have gotten our entire money back because we did not get what we paid for.  I would discourage anyone from utilizing any of their services.  Stay away from Maya Battles and any of their marketing services.  They are the worst. Do not get ripped off like we did.  I wish I saw the posting listed on this website.  It would have saved us a lot of money. "
566,2,"I have been a member of BMG music for over 2yrs. I have always checked the box that says do not send this months selection. They billed me for (2) CDs in the pasted that I had not ordered. After calling their toll number they told me they would look into it, but I should check with my mailman. After this happened I wrote them a letter and told them not to send me anymore CDs. I wanted to cancel my membership. They continued to send me mail & _CDs_. I just recieved another bill for a CD I have not ordered or got in the mail. I'm not going to waste my time calling them to let them know, as far as I'm concerned they should have taking my name off their mailing list when I told them to cancel my membership."
567,1,"I bought a piano from them (Jim) a couple of months ago. I originally called to check on a couple of used pianos that seemed good but they had NONE of them available because they were all sold, he said. Jim promptly tried to sell me a different piano (new) and the price seemed good so I ordered one. The piano was shipped because I was in a different state. The day after I received it several keys were getting stuck. I called Jim right away and he said it was because it was new and told me to wiggle the keys to see if it makes it better. I did but it didn't help. Since the first tuning was included, we thought that will fix the problem so waited 3 weeks for the tuner to come. The problem persisted after the tuning session but we just got by thinking it will get better as parts wear. After months the problem didn't go away so we hired our regular tuner to tune it. He found out that there was a problem with the hammer action that was preventing the hammers to get back into ready position after repeatedly hitting certain keys. I called Jim and he refused to believe that it was a faulty piano. I told him what my tuner told me and he asked for the tuner's phone number, told me that he would talk to him and call me back. So, I waited until his promised date but didn't get a call back so I called him and he said he will have the piano exchanged. I asked him if a trade-up to a different piano was possible and he said yes. I'd seen a couple of used Yamahas and Kawais on their site so I asked about them and NONE of them are available. He says he will be getting a new shipment from Japan in a couple of weeks and there's one 30 year old Yamaha that's priced a grand more than what I bought. He said it's either that or a direct replacement of the broken piano. I wasn't about to pay a grand more for a used piano so I said just go ahead and send the replacement. Here are my problems with them:1. They NEVER seem to have the pianos (used) on their website in stock because every time I call, they were gone and they recommend something else.2. They also advertise a lot on Ebay. I saw a Kawai on it that fit my bill and when I called Jim to ask why he said he didn't have any used pianos that fit my requirements, he said it wasn't supposed to be there. Why advertise on Ebay when you don't have the product?3. Jim never got back to me as he promised. I always had to call him back and he got angry at me for calling him too often. and we had an argument. Yes, I called him several times in 1-2 weeks period to find out what's going on but this piano is being used for teaching kids so I need this problem resolved asap.4. Jim uses an awful alot of god damn in his language.I call in to inquire about used pianos that are clearly being advertised on their website and Ebay pages, and Jim tries to sell me a different one.And, I AM SORRY for asking for some customer service regarding the warranty on a new piano that's a few months old but that's not a reason to mix in god damn in your language in every conversation when talking to a customer.I am waiting for my replacement piano with no ETA (I asked and he said he didn't know when)Don't let the low prices lure you into this place. You will regret it.Oh, and after the argument I called back to say sorry for whatever I said to him that pissed him off, and he goes off on me saying he's ready to quit his business after 56 years because of things like this, said he accepts my apology and hung up on me. I was speechless..."
568,1,"Let me start out by saying that it takes a lot for me to become upset with a business.  They would really have to make an honest effort to screw over me or someone I knew.  This all started because my dog chewed up the cord to my keyboard.  This keyboard is not some rinky-dink casio either.  It's a $1000 keyboard made by Roland.  After my dog chewed it up, I decided to go through a local family owned store to purchse the adaptor cord.  This was my first mistake, not if you count getting a dog.  I went to Richard's Music.  I went into Richard's music with the cord and they told me they would have to order it from their distributor.  I said ok, and handed them over 35 bucks.  This was July of this year.  I waited about two weeks, nothing.  I called them and asked them to call me back with a estimated time that i would receieve my cord.  No call back.  Nothing.  During September and October, I guess I just kind of forgot about the cord altogether.  Then one day I glanced at my unusuable keybboard and thought to myself when the hell is that cord gonna come in.  So I called Richard's Music back and asked where it was, it had been 3 months now and it should not take even one month.  They said it was on back order, and that they would have a manager call me back.  Weird I thought, but not totally unbelieveable.  No call back.  Over the past 5 months I have called them at least 2 dozen times, each time the same woman tells me a manager is not in and that she will leave a message.  Last nght I had reched my limit.  I called up, got the same woman, and I told her I wanted to speak to a manager.  She said that they normally don't let people talk to the manager.  What the hell is that about?  Is he the wizard of oz?  Don't concern yourself with the man behind the curtain.  I told her I want my money back, because you did not give me anything.  She tells me it can only be exchanged for store credit.  That right there is total BS, because I never purchased anything from them.  I paid them to do a service - they did not do it - and now why would I want to have any credit in such an anful store.  I want my money back, and until then they can expect about 10 calls a day from me.  They have never even offered up a simple apology.  That right there proves how horribel of a business this place is.  I also did some checking around with some musician friends of mine, and they all told me they are the worst store in this town, and the worst they have ever dealt with.  DON'T PATRONIZE THIS STORE.  THEY WILL JUST SCREW YOU OVER. "
569,1,"I was looking for a new cornet ( a small trumpet) and found on-line the web store of Jim Laabs Music, based in Wisconsin ( I live in Michigan). They were advertising a brand of trumpets and cornets supposedly made in Germany: Schiller, Frankfurt, Germany. The look of the instruments was good, the prices were competitive, and I was reassured from the fact that these trumpets were made in Germany and not in some place in the Far East and China where, very often, bad quality products are manufactured. I sent an e-mail at 11pm and immediately got an answer, in which they strongly recommended the Schiller Pro Rose Bell cornet as an excellent instrument. I sent them $ 270.00 including shipping and after a few days I got my new German trumpet. What a disappointment ! The bell of the trumpet was as thin as a baked beans can, the intonation was way off, the mouthpiece was unplayable. I immediately contacted Jim Laabs Music in order to return the trumpet and get a refund. No answer. I tried again, several times, during a whole week. No reply. Finally I managed to talk on the phone with a guy at the store , very unfriendly and rude, who told me that they do not have a return policy and then shut down the phone. I did a research and finally discovered that the Schiller, Frankfurt, Germany original Company does not exists any more, and that a Chinese entrepreneur bought years ago the rights to use the Schiller name in order to market some cheap instruments made in China as German Schiller, Frankfurt, instruments.And you know who is the official Distributor for the United States of this supposedly German Company ? Jim Laabs Music itself !Any way, long story short, all my attempts to return this piece of junk have failed, and I am stuck with a bad trumpet and $ 270.00 lost. I am posting this complain with the hope that it will save some other customer from being ripped off by these dishonest people. Thanks."
570,2,"I applied for a mortgage in March 2009, my credit report came back with a negative report from National Credit Solutions. I contacted the NCS and was informed that I had been reported to their company by BMG Music Services in December of 2008 for non payment for CD's in the amount of $161.63. I never ordered, gave consent or received music CD's from BMG or any other company. I was further informed the CD's were delivered to an address I havent lived at for 4 years. I made several attempts to contact a physical person at BMG...I have hit a brick wall. My credit rating has been destroyed by BMG for $161.63 for CD's I never ordered!!!!!! I wasnt able to get the all time low interest rate. My credit history was impeccable....I feel violated."
571,2,"Our clarinet needed to be cleaned, recorked, and according to The Music Place, repadded (an overhaul). Upon first pick-up, the instrument was not clean. I sent it back to be recleaned. It was returned, not completely clean, but I took it home anyway. When my son put it together and played it, he was unable to produce sound. His music teacher confirmed there was definitely something wrong and sent a note in detailing what they should take a look at. After sending it back, they repeatedly insisted there was nothing wrong with it. Realizing I was getting nowhere, I took the clarinet to another music shop (((Competitor's name redacted))). I assumed a minor repair was needed. To my surprise, (((redacted)))'s tech tech said that the pads were not seated properly and that excessive glue was used, resulting in improper seal and the inability to easily produce sound. It would take $250 to completely strip the thing and start from scratch. In a nutshell, (((redacted))) said that The Music Place needed to fix the mess they made of our clarinet. However, The Music Place insisted that there is nothing wrong with the clarinet. They accused my son's teacher of being inexperienced and not knowing what she's talking about (untrue), refused to speak to (((redacted)))'s tech, insisted that the problem is my son's inexperience, and even implied I was fabricating the whole thing. My son's inexperience was clearly not the issue because the rental prior to this was just fine, and I had confirmation from both another tech and his teacher. I offered to get a third opinion from another tech, and they said it would make no difference. They refuse to refund my money. (((redacted))) said the clarinet is unsellable in its current condition, therefore it is of no use to them, except maybe for parts. Now I have to buy a new clarinet. Effectively, The Music Place ruined ours and has caused us to be without an instrument for months now."
572,2,"I placed an order on Sunday. I looked at my bank account and seen I was charged on Sunday and then again on Tuesday. I called the company billing department and was told that is how they do business and I would have one charge dropped off in ""a couple of days"". Nowhere did I ever see anything stating I would be charged twice. The billing department was not very helpful and was actually rude. I will NEVER order from them again."
573,3,"In 2013, I called to complain because I had purchased wigs from Paula Young since the 70's and had the Adelaide wig for a long time. Then they were no longer true to size so I was asked to return the wigs to Specialty Commerce Co Customer Support. Never heard back from them so I switched to the Trisha Wig. This past month 11/2015 I ordered it on the website and the color was not available. Then I checked the catalog and called and they said it was an error on the website. I returned and received the correct color. Now, the large no longer covers my hairline and the hair itself is much shorter. Not at all true to the ad in the catalog. I was also told the website would be fixed for the color error and has still not been fixed. Paula Young apparently was not great motivated to talk to me on the phone.
Updated on 05/26/2016: I received a phone call the very next day and was informed that they were having issues with the Trisha wig. I received credit for the return and also received free shipping on the Naples that I chose to use in the meantime. I was also given a number to call her back if I had problems with the Naples. Since the Naples has more hair and also a little longer than the Trisha, I thought I would call that number and find out if the issue with the Trisha had been resolved. Previously, when I had called the number and asked for Latonya, I was able to leave a message and she returned my call. This time I was asked which department, and I told her the situation and I didn't know the department. Maybe it was someone in Customer Service. I was transferred and they didn't know Latonya but looked at my account and said nothing was posted as to my previous conversation with Latonya.
They tried to transfer or get some information for me but were unable and then asked if they could help me with anything or if I would like to place an order. I said that I didn't want to order and have to return unless I knew that the issue with the Trisha had been resolved. They were not able to tell me other than maybe the next batch of them that they received might be correct. Apparently, they do not follow up to see if the size or length has been corrected. The only good thing I can say is that someone did contact me originally and they do finally have the color added on their website. I recently looked to see the new wigs they mentioned to see if I could find a different one and now I keep getting emails regarding that, asking if I found anything or if they could help me. I’m waiting to be helped, but not for long time…"
574,1,"Never in all my life have I seen such incompetance from a company. Purchased a DEFECTIVE guitar and as of today I have no idea what they have done with it. They have my money. I have no guitar. The run-around is getting pathetic and no one will ever return a phone call. This has been going on for over two weeks now. I have never in fifty years been treated this poorly as a customer. DO NOT ever go into this store or purchase anything from them. They are a complete joke and run a real bad business. Guess I'm out 300 bucks and boy am I pissed. If I could afford a lawyer I'd sue them to hell and back. They are worthless, managers included. What a sorry bunch. Not even Corporate will return phone calls. Toyal joke of a company. STAY AWAY !!!!"
575,2,"To be concise. I purchased a guitar from L.A. Music by mail order. In particular a Gibson SGJ 2013. It arrived in sub-standard condition. It was defective in the following ways (get ready for  this) ahem. 1/The nut on the guitar was so sharp ot cut my han on first use. 2/It had obviously experienced a humidity drop resulting in fretboard shrinkage, overhanging frets and achange in shape of the neck. This rendered the guitar impossible to tune. 3/The printing on the toogle switch surround plate was smudged. 4/The saddle of the G-string was incorrectly filed sitting too high and put of sync with the others. 5/The free gig bag zip was broken.Since then(9/12/13) i was ignored other than one phone call. When i contacted the Canadian distibutor, whose manager (Mike Holman) was a gentleman, this poor guy didn't know what to think. On one hand they're telling him they've communicated with me and lying about it and on the other is me just wanting someone to listen. In the end it's the 10th of January and i've got a guitar i can't play, a bag that can't hold it and nobody wants to f***ing know. Bring your f***ing lawyers on.     "
576,2,We purchased a puppy from this establishment and should have read all the complaints on the internet. Our puppy developed Parvo and the pet store would not help us at all. We called the SPCA for Orange County California and they said they had many complaints for me to call the Orange County Animal Care Division which I did and again they have heard of this store and there have been many complaints. Our dog still remains after 4 days to be really sick and this store would not take the dog back and would not refund me my money or offer Veterinary care from their Vet. There is a California state law that actually has a lemon law on sick pets. I WANT MY MONEY BACK! To at least help me the all the Vet bills I have incurred.
577,1,I took my ACD to the vet in August where she was diagnosed with Valley Fever. They took xrays and blood tests. The insurance company has repeatedly told me they need a history from the vet.  This is the only time the dog was ever seen for an illness. She is not even two years old. The vet has sent three copies of the bill and his report about the office visit but the insurance company refuses to acknowledge that fact. They have stalled on reimbursement (only 80% and $200.00 deductible) long enough to get a second Premium payment out of me. They have plenty of customer reviews on their website explaining how much money they have paid back to customers but they all sound like they were written by management! Don't waste your time and money on these people!
578,2,"On June 4th we brought our 11 year old Chow-Shephard to Banfield to have her back legs checked out.  They did absolutely nothing for her except try to sell you there Wellness Plan, give her all her shots, a pain killer shot and medications.  They took no blood samples or xrays because they were short on time and couldn't get her back in to see them until Saturday, June 13th in which they wanted to do a dental cleaning and then due the xrays. Then we were sent home being told her breathing was fine, her heart sounded good and maybe she is just loosing muscle in her back legs.  We were given pain meds, antiboitics, and joint vitamins.  How do they prescribe anything without knowing what is truly going on her? Anyway on the 2nd day she was very limb and vomiting and I called them to report this.  With no concern at all the they told me we couldn't see her until Thursaday, June 11th. and it would have to be a drop off visit. No urgency what so ever. Being said our Prncess died on Wednesday, June 10th. How can they tell you give it the medication with no type of results to look at. Never again will I use Banfield Hospital or get there wellness plan that they charged me for canceling when I only had it for a week. My family is just truly heart broken and frustrated at this time."
579,1,"A friend of mine purchased a hamster for her daughter from Pet Connection. The hamster along with a cage and wood shavings for bedding. Unfortunately, the hamster only survived for a few days after the purchase. My friend wanted answers for what went wrong and discovered that the wood shavings that were recommended by the store manager are proven to be lethal to rodants. My friend and her husbond called the store to enquire about a refund. The manager told them that it was their fault that the animal had died and hung up on them. If you go to their Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/Pet-Connection-Lincoln-Illinois-165085210344327/), you will see that it if full of negative reviews from unsatisfied customers who say that the animal live in poor and filthly conditions and the management is unprofessional. I think P.E.T.A. may need to get involved along with the B.B.B. Possible criminal charges for animal cruelty as well. Do not go to this place for your pet needs. "

581,1,"I have a freshwater aquarium and I went to buy a placo for the tank. While I was there, I saw a fiddler crab, but I didn't know how to care for him. The sales associate told me that the crab would be just fine in the freshwater. So I bought them both. Very excited, I took them home and floated their bags so they would get used to the water. This was around 2:00 p.m. About an hour later, I noticed the fiddler crab was moving slowly, and spending lots of time sitting still. I researched them online and found, to my dismay, that they are brackish water animals. Not only that, but many pet stores keep them in freshwater, which greatly weakens them and shortens their lifespan. Sadly, the fiddler crab died about 2 hours later, in spite of my efforts to save him. I called the store and they admitted that they put a little salt in the water, but failed to tell me. Needless to say, I was disappointed and angry. Imagine my surprise when I checked the placo a little while later, and he was dead too!! I don't know what they are doing, but whatever it is, it is terrible for these little animals. So take my advice, and don't buy aquarium pets from Pet Supermarket until they learn how to provide the proper care for their animals."
582,1,"On July 9th, 2013, I ordered pet supplies from the online company (Pet Shed). Two weeks after I placed the order, I still had not received the products. When I first contacted the company (by email and phone), I was informed that they were “doing maintenance” on their system and they could not help me at this time. In addition, their website was down for maintenance. I was also told that shipment usually takes 10 to 14 business days. What I had not realized at the time I was placing the order is that they are located in China!! There was no indication on their website as to where they are located. I only figured this out because my bank charged me an international transaction fee. A couple of days later, I checked their website again and noticed that “they were up and running” again. I send them another email asking about my order. They told me once again that it had been sent. When I asked for the carrier information and tracking number, I was informed that they did not have that information because they sent the package by “mail.” Instead they told me that they would re-send the order. In the same email, they mentioned that I should contact my local post office to find out where the package was. Furthermore, I was informed that once I receive the “original” order, I was to return it to them in order to avoid being charged again. I have never had to deal with a company that does not track their shipments. Nor have I ever experienced customer service that is so ridiculously inept. I just want to make sure that other people do not fall for this company and get ripped off."
583,2,"First off, I have been to two vets in my area that offered Pet Assure and a third that I'd gotten a price quote from. Everyone of them I've found to be grossly more expensive than other vets in the area (2X-3X more!) After 2 of my cats ended up racking up some pretty large bills at my vet for various things.  I was looking closely at my receipt to see that I was receiving all of the discounts that I was suppose to, having been a loyal Pet Assure customer for some 3 odd years.I saw a lot of discrepancies such as a $392.56 bill on one of my cats visits only being discounted $31.44 (not even 10%) all of it was In-house medical perhaps minus a $6.00 medical waste disposal feeI had another cat with an upper respiratory go in for a check up/exam visit and a nail trim. Bill was $133.00 (minus $26 for a take-home prescription & medical waste disposal fee, so $107.00) I received NO Pet Assure discount for her, so I guess Doctor Visit Extended and Nail Trim don't constitute as discountable? The website sure says different. I should have received a $26.75 discount (25% off $107.00), but I received nothing.   So with both of these troubling bills and the vet unwilling to work with me. I contacted Pet Assure for assistance. I faxed her the bills and upon first seeing them agreed that it looked like there were quite a few errors made and that she'd contact the vet and see what she could work out. I was pleased at this point. Then she got back with me and said that every questionable undiscounted item she brought up was defended by the vet and that they made very good points, stating that they would be out of business if they were to take off all this money and that they have competitive prices for the area.. Ummm so you can't honor things that pet assure's website lists as you should be covering because you'll be losing so much money you'd have to shut down. And that constitutes a fair reason? And the most ludicrous part is that she sided with them and said that they seem for the most part to be applying the Pet Assure discount approprotely, that they haven't received any other complaints from Pet Assure members about that particular vet and there's nothing they can do to help me in fighting for my correct discount. I ended up losing thousands of dollars at over-priced participating Pet Assure vets that did not discount properly and got crappy support from Pet Assure. (Just as an example I got a quote from the Pet Assure associated vet for $1500.00 to remove my cat's eye. After seeing how little Pet Assure was willing to fight for me, I shopped around at other vets nearby and found 1 other vet with a quote under $1000 & 2 other vets with quotes under $700! I ended up paying $640 and that included his take home medication that the vet wanting $1500 would have charged an extra $200 for!  It's really a disgrace that Pet Assure would in a sense sponsor vets that are as overpriced as they are and then the vets are't even discounting properly and Pet Assure can't help. And aren't they suppose to be making health care less of a burden for pet owners instead of causing them more stress, headache and financial loss?"
584,1,"Banfield Pet Hospital scam... My dog Shadow had a serious injury to her leg last evening 11-07-2016. It needed cleaning, a stitch or two and a bandage, possibly some antibiotics. I took her to the Banfield Pet Hospital Winter Garden Fl location at 6:30 PM where I pay $40.00 per month per dog, I have 3 dogs on the plan. $120.00 per mos. They did not even want to look at her and told me to take her to a pet hospital across town that was closing at 7 PM making it impossible to do so. After I insisted they at least look at her considering I pay them to do exactly that they finally did. The Vet told me they were getting ready to close and could not help and that they could not see her today because they had appointments all day. I had to take her home and clean and close her wounds myself to stop the bleeding. Considering the name Banfield Pet Hospital leads me to believe it's a hospital for pets, why am I turned away? I pay for three dogs a month and when I desperately need the service I am told to go elsewhere because they are closing and too busy to help an injured animal. What kind of Doctor does something like that? What is pet insurance for if they won't help an injured pet when needed. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS INSURANCE SCAM PEOPLE. Banfield Pet Hospital is a fraud and does not care about animals at all. It's all about the money."
585,2,"I was searching the internet for an English Bulldog.  I have been wanting a puppy for a long time for my children and I came across a dog that needed to be rehomed or adopted out.  The person listed the puppy on eBay and since I have used eBay before and have never had any problems getting my things shipped I thought this would be handled the same way.  So I contacted the person of the puppy and she emailed me back stating that she simply did not have the time to take care of the dog and the dog needed a home.  She asked me to email her my information so that the airline would be able to send me all the information that was needed in order for the puppy to be flown out.  The pet transportation company contacted me and told me that all I would pay for is the total amount of $310 and nothing more.  I should of known that was too good to be true but when I looked at everything, everything seemed to be legit.  Well it came to be that they kept on asking for more money.  After everything I sent them the $310 and then the money for the insurance of the dog which was $1275 and the money for the crate and ownership papers $955 I ended up canceling the last payment that I had made so they weren't able to receive all the money.  Now I have no puppy and i'm out $2285.  At that the people would call me and tell me that the dog was on her way and I would wait here at my house for the dog and they were never heard from again.    "
586,2,"On Feb. 26, 2006 My girlfriend and I went to our local pet store and was looking for another gerbil. My Girlfriend saw a little white one and wanted that one, so i asked the store employee if the gerbil was treated for major diseases and where they came from. At that time I was assured that they were quality gerbils and all in good health. I got the gerbil home and put him in a new cage that I had bought him. I work nights so sometimes its hard for me to always notice everything, but three days later before i went to work I was changing their water and food and noticed he would not open his eyes and didn’t run from my hand like normal. So I gave him some vitamins and went to work, well while I was at work he passed away. At that time I still had to work the next few nights so I didn’t have time to call the store and get the problem resolved. I cleaned the cage with bleach like my vet told me to do, so my other gerbil would not get the disease. According to the vet the gerbil had Wet Tail a serious disease that cause dehydration and is more common in Hamsters. It will cause likely death in all small animals, so I wanted to keep my gerbil safe. Well Sunday March 5 I noticed that my gerbil, Spaz, would not move or open his eyes. I knew what was wrong and it upset me. I tried to give him water through an eye dropper, but it was too late, he passed away Monday morning at 4 A.M. Later on Monday morning I called the Pet Land store in Olathe, Kansas, where i purchased my little white gerbil. Debbie answered the phone, she is the store manager, and told her my situation. She was very rude and had no remorse for either gerbil that had passed away and lied to me telling me that they treat for Wet and Dry Tail Disease every morning. She refused to give me a refund for the gerbil because I did not call a week after I had bought him. I missed by 12 Hours. I miss my gerbil and i will never go back to Pet Land because they hire teenagers for minimum wage who know nothing about animals and don't care. All they want is the money, and don't care about anybody else."
587,1,"Pet Paradise is a puppy mill pet store. I went in the other day to look at a Wheaten Terrier. The dog was a male & adorable. I asked the girl to see the papers on the dog. I then came hoem & checked the breeder. Guess what? Steve Kruse in Iowa is a puppy mill that has been sued for giving Pet Paradise sick dogs. If you search his name, you will see photos of rusted cages & it states he is a puppy mill, not a pure breeder. I was so upset, because everyone I spoke to said do not buy from Pet Paradise. I was going to buy this cute dog anyway, but when I did my research, I was so sick that they lie to everyone with their false pedigree papers. They also charge a lot more money than a real breeder. DO NOT BUY a DOG FROM THEM ! THEY ARE LIARS!!!!"
588,1,"Hi, my name is Beirit... I needed some community service and thought the best way to enjoy that time would be to finish my hours by playing with puppies... My family and I had bought two dogs from Laurie one of which I love to death... his name is Winston and I bought him myself at the age of 16 with the money I saved (he was 1000 dollars) he's a lovable healthy Basset Hound... I started doing some community service with Laurie she was completely rude to me... I felt that I was being talked down to and made to look stupid among the people looking to purchase a puppy... SHE ALMOST REFUSED TO SIGN THE PAPERWORK THAT I HAD DONE 6 HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE... my high school would not let me graduate without these hours… she said that she wasn’t sure that I had actually been there for hours... WHY WOULD I HAVE LIED ABOUT THAT?! I had zero problem sitting in a pen with about 15 puppies playing... it was heaven. haha... my sister who is 13 and had volunteered there way more times than I had also needed some hours for community service... She and I went in to APH and SHE REFUSED TO SIGN HER FORM... she knows my sister and my sister started volunteering there over a YEAR AGO... personally... if i ever see Laurie again there is no doubt in my mind that i would scream at her for the treatment of myself and my sister... SHE IS RUDE SHE SELLS SICK PUPPIES (which i noticed while volunteering... there were a lot of puppies coughing and limping) SHE OVERCHARGES COMPLETELY its outrageous..."

The tracking # didn't work until the day before it finally showed 2 WEEKS LATER!!! I sent the package back, unopened and asked for a refund, which they DECLINED to do!

590,1,"I joined Banfield Pet hospital 7/28/15 for a wellness plan for my pet. I was told all the great things about the wellness plan. I was convinced, this could save me money.  What they fail to tell people is that if your pet dies, you are still responsible for the contract. It is stated in the contract that you can cancel but there are many contingencies. It never states in the contract that you are still responsible for the contract until the end of your year. I also have heard from others that we are never told when the contract ends when your year is up. They just automatically charge you.  I would propose to Banfield is sharing all of the wonderful things about the plan, you should also be told about the negative things about the plan.  I feel they are ripping off people especially the elders, like me that are on a fixed income! I think when an employee signs someone up for the wellness plan, they get a bonus. Please help us consumer."
591,2,"On December 13, 2016 I contacted Discount Meds to place an order for flees protection, the order total was $397.93. The company had stated that it would take 5-10 business day to arrive at my home. After not receiving my order by the 23rd of December I contacted them by e-mail the phone number they provided did not work. I received an e-mail back from john stating that because of the holidays it might be held up, whatever.   The first tracking number they gave me said it was in Singapore for three days, then the tracking said it arrived in Germany. Now the tracking number says there is no information on this number.   I looked this company up on the BBB and the review on this company is anything but good. How can these people keep getting away with stuff like this? My bank is looking into this.   They have not responded to my recent e-mail, so I am assuming they are done with me. I just hope and pray I get my money back, I do not have $397. to give away!!  "
592,1,"Hen I adopted two older kittens from a shelter, the shelter recommended pet insurance since they had no way of knowing about the health of animals in their facility. The insurance would protect me should the cats have medical problems. So I called the company they recommended - PetFirst. At no time did anyone from PetFirst say anything about pre-existing conditions or worming being excluded. I was told only that the insurance did not include wellness care which I felt was very appropriate. It didn't take long before I realized that I had adopted both cats with a pre-existing problem. One tested positive for roundworms so both were treated. Even after treatment, both had loose stools with some bright red blood in the litter box. In other ways, the cats were healthy. I didn't try to submit a claim until 8 months later when the problem was persisting, and I had already incurred several hundred dollars in vet bills. The cats were given worming medicine again as a precaution even though their previous culture was negative. PetFirst denied all payment on the claim, insisting that it was a pre-existing illness, was routine care (nail cutting was included on the same bill), and that worming was not included. They must have all these rules in their fine print but they certainly don't tell you when they sign you up. And they knew these cats were adopted from a shelter which made them high risk. At the very least, this company is highly unethical and it may be fraud since they do not disclose very important terms and conditions and are signing you up over the phone even before you can't see and review their policy which arrives by mail several weeks later. And they made a point of reviewing normal exclusions on the phone. Then when you really need the insurance, they conveniently have a reason hidden in their exclusions to deny the claim and this is probably after you have paid their premiums for quite some time (as I did). I paid them $50.95 per month from June, 2017 through January 2018."
593,2,"This past year I have purchased 4 of the secret crown pieces and with my hairdressers help styling them, they were absolutely perfect. The fifth piece I purchased did not have as much hair as the ones I previously purchased and when I attempted to return it in January for an exchange as this one did not have the same amount of hair as the others, I was told I was too late and if I did try to return it would be kept and donated to charity. Please also note that their return clock begins on the date they mark it as shipped out and drop in items from a 3rd party vendor have only a 21 day total window - assuming they will even honor a return (I have my doubts). I WILL NEVER RISK ANOTHER PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY."
594,1,"Do NOT... I repeat DO NOT purchase dogs from this woman! I purchased a MaltiPoo from Anna in July of last year. Anna assured me that both the mother and father of this dog were hers and that she bred them personally. Since then, I have had nothing, but problems and the dog was sick from the get-go. Not long after buying it, it was confirmed by my vet that the dog had an internal parasite, so bad that he had to have had it since birth. Upon learning this, I called Anna to discuss. The truth then came out that she only had the mother and that the father was someone else's dog. I asked if the mother was the Maltese or the Poodle and what the father was and she completely ignored me and moved on to another topic. At that point, she stood by her vet's diagnosis of the dog at the time of purchase...which was the picture of health (she claims!). I asked her if I could have the name of the vet and his phone # to speak to him personally and she, once again, completely ignored me and moved on to another topic. More recently, I had the dog in the emergency room at the vet last week due to a hip injury and, after a series of x-rays, it was determined that the dog has a hereditary bone disorder in which the knees don't sit properly in the socket. The condition is ranked on a scale between 1-4, with 4 being the most severe. The dog was diagnosed between a 3-4, making him a candidate for orthoscopic surgery. This condition also leads into severe arthritis. Being a hereditary disorder, the mother and/or the father had it and, knowing this, breeders are not to breed those dogs. I called her last week to discuss it and Anna proceeded to call me every name in the book, threatened me with bodily harm, to hook me up to the back end of her Hummer and drag my up and down Firestone Boulevard, and threatened to put me in the hospital. I told her I was bringing the dog back to her and I wanted my money back and, if not, I would see her in Court. She told me my b***s weren't big enough and that this was her world and I lived in it. I then called the Sherrif's Department and told them what happened and that she threatened me. I took the dog back that day (with police escort) and, conveniently, she was not there. The Sherrif spoke to her on the phone in which she proceeded to call me every name in the book...again and told him how psycho I and my vets are. I left the dog there, was given a receipt on a scrap of paper by her worker and left. She called my husband that night and told him the dog was ready for pick-up and that he was in perfect health and had been checked out by her vet after we left. My husband asked if he could have the name and # of the vet and was told he could get that info when he picked the dog up the next day (Friday). My daughter called for me the next day and spoke to Anna and asked if Anna could fax the vet paperwork to her so we could speak to the vet personally. Anna, once again, said we could get that info when we picked the dog up on Tuesday after the President's Day holiday (it was supposed to be that day!). At that point, my daughter told her that we were not picking up the dog at all and that we would see her in Court. Anna then showed her true self and proceeded to cuss my daughter out and said she knows how this game is played (obviously, she's been here before with other clients!). Since then, we have found out that there is no vet - she gives all shots and self-diagnoses the animals herself. She also does not breed these dogs herself - she gets them all from puppy mills and passes them off to be affluent breeds. Anna Gabriel needs to be shut down! She not only goes by Anna Gabriel and Norwalk Pet Grooming, but also by...Anna Beradini, Anna Bernadini, Anna M. Berardini, Anna's Pet Grooming, Cockapoo Connection, California Cockapoos, MaltiPoo's and More and she also incorporated in 2004 under the name Anna's Pet Grooming Corporation. In 2003 Anna was convicted of practicing veterinary medicine without a license. She was doing tail docking and dewclaw removal at her shop. They also found several SICK puppies that she was treating without vet supervision or prescription! Anna pleaded not guilty though that was her plea, she was sentenced to 6 months probation. Obviously the state thought differently. In 1999 American Kennel Club yanked her registration privileges for not identifying her dogs properly and not keeping good records and was sentenced to 10 years of no registrations. And just recently on June 16th of 2005 Anna was under the watchful eye again. L. A. County issued a search warrant for her home and both her shop after many many angry people who bought sick puppies demanded that something be done about this cruel money-hungry woman who treats these poor puppies like products."
595,1,"I'm very disappointed to discover that this company is deceptive.  My recent claim for allergy-related testing was denied based on the fact that my puppy was seen for a hot spot one month before his insurance policy was activated. Hot spots DO NOT always indicate allergy problems.  He was never seen for any allergy problems for a year following the initial hot spot visit and was never diagnosed with allergies or treated for the problem until several weeks ago.  I spoke with supervisor Kelly who informed me that Pet Plan denied the claim on the basis that the allergies were a pre-existing condition. My vet stated that hot spots are not always an indication of allergies; they can be caused by many factors.  It was never noted in my veterinary record that my dog suffered from allergies, nor was any medical treatment prescribed for an allergy problem.  The fact that my dog never had any problems over the course of the following year should have substantiated the fact that he had no allergy issues. If this had been an allergy issue, he would have been seen again within a year, testing would have been done at that point and medication would have been prescribed.  None of this happened until a few weeks ago.  The denial of this claim in unsubstantiated and unacceptable and conveys to me that this company is in fact, deceptive and unscrupulous in its practices.  I have cancelled my policy.  I am a member of the German Shepherd rescue community and professional dog training community, and I will no longer recommend this deceptive company.  If this company would twist medical diagnosis to benefit them for a small claim such as this, they would most certainly twist facts in an attempt to weasel out of paying for very expensive claims.  "
596,1,"The Pet Pantry, Int'l (recently changed their name to Pet product to hide major debts) has been selling franchises and not delivering. They get you to pre-pay everything up front but seem to take forever to deliver goods to you (the franchise). Which in turn makes it very difficult to service you customers. They owe many of their existing franchises money, and we have seen no effort or goodwill to return any of these prepaid moneys. They have changed their suppliers several times in one year, and even changed the QAULITY of the ingredients in their pet foods making them much more inferior! To make things worse, with 3+ months delivery times (we've been waiting since April 29th), and now inferior products, they make no effort to help their franchises.

597,2,"I had an appointment for Pet Love to come to my house and groom my Golden Retriever. They showed up a few minutes late. I took my dog out to the van. I made sure my dog got loaded and on the table that I felt was really too small to do a dog his size. I made sure he was fairly calm. Grooming stresses him out, (that is why I thought by paying more for someone to come to my house would be less stressful on my dog). About 30 minutes later I saw the groomer walking around her van. About 30 minutes after that I saw her again walking around her van, talking on the phone. I decided to see what was going on, she had been a my home for an hour already and I didn't like that my dog was left alone unattended in the van up on a table he was tied to. The groomer still talking on the phone then told me she couldn't find her clippers that they must have been stolen. I then took my dog out of the van he had been tied up in for over an hour. The groomer said she was on the phone w/ the office and would let me know what they could work out w/ either rescheduling me or getting her some clippers delivered. 30 minutes later she knocked my door and said I could either reschedule or wait another 15 minutes and someone to deliver clippers to her. She had already been their for an hour and a half. I told her I could not wait any longer, I had other stuff to do. She told me to call the office to reschedule and left. A few minutes after she left the Pet Love office called me to reschedule. I told them I did not wish to reschedule. I was told I would be charged a cancellation fee. I told them I was not happy that it took their groomer over an hour to even let me know she was unable to do the job I had hired them to do. I was only told after they had been at my house for an hour because I went out to the van to see why she was out the van walking around talking on the phone and why my dog was left unattended and tied up in her van. These people are very unprofessional. I am very sorry that their equipment was stolen, misplaced, or the van was improperly stocked, or the groomer was sent to do a job without the proper equipment. But I am upset it took over a hour to notify me of the situation and my dog was left tied up and unattended. I don't care if they do bill me. I won't pay them a cancellation fee for them wasting over an hour and half of my time!"

599,1,"BEWARE! I purchased a puppy from Anna's on 11/1/2008.  He was a great dog and we loved him very much.  He died at 2:00 am on 1/1/2012 at the very young age of 3.  We go to a very reputable Vet clinic who tried everything to keep him alive.  We did not care about the money.  However, we lost the battle in the end.  He became ill from IMHA (Immune Mediated Hemolytic Anemia) on 12/25/2011.  This is a known as an inherited disease.  Anna is only interested in making money.  She does not care about the pedigree of the dog or where the dog came from.  Please, let us stop these puppy mills! Please, do not buy an animal from her!  It will only rip your heart out. My rating of Anna's is negative infinity as you cannot put a number on your heart but unfortunately I have to select a 1 star to post this review.  That is really stupid!"
600,1,"This hospital is a total rip off!  My puppy died last month and I called to cancel the wellness plan.  To my surprise they said they would change it to a non-recurring  status but I would still have to pay for the plan until October.  I told them I didn’t sign a contract but they said that signing up for the wellness plan was a year contract and that I had to pay for the remainder of the year.  I was furious!  My little puppy only had her annual 2 shots and 1 test.  They said that $400 dollars worth of services were performed so I had to pay it back.  That is BS, my puppy was healthy and was there to get a check up only and they are telling me that 2 shots were $400.00!  I paid around $115 dollars when I walked out of there which includes her heart work and fled medicine which their sorry plan didn’t cover.  So now they are charging me $32.95 until October.  I called their customer service and told them my puppy died and they didn’t care, they said I still had to pay.  I then told him I got a new puppy and asked since there was a credit of services that my previous puppy didn’t use if it could be transferred over and they said no I would have to get a whole new plan for the dog.   I asked to speak to a supervisor and he said she was on a phone call then said she was available and he would transfer me over.  The call was transferred but it went to voicemail.  I left a detailed message with all my information and have yet to receive a call back from this sorry company.  I have called my bank to dispute the charge.  There was nothing said about a contract, I was signing for authorization of payment for services that day but they said the form was a contract.  This company is a total scam and care nothing about your pet, they only want to get as much money as they can."
601,3,"Starting July 3rd, 2018, I've had an issue with my Madden mobile account. I have sent EA a request every day this week to try to get it fixed. Today 7/7/18 while I was on the phone with a member of their support team I asked to speak with a supervisor or a manager. The advisor wouldn't let me speak to a manager or supervisor and then ended the call.

602,3,"It has been nearly 3 weeks since EA banned/suspended my club in ultimate team (FUT 18). I purchased $23 dollars worth of FIFA coins of a website when I later found out was against the rules and regulations of FIFA Ultimate team. I had no idea... If I knew that was against the rules and would have lost my club there is no way in hell I would have done so! Especially after I have spent so much of my own time, effort and money on packs to build it to where it is. I have written several emails to EA and they have not gotten back to me once.
I have called the customer support line several times and they tell me there is nothing they can do, ""just keep checking your emails for them to get back to you."" I then receive an automated email saying: ""Hello, We wanted to check and see how things were going after we provided you more information about your recent request. We’re happy to help if you still need us. You can review and update this issue from the My Cases page. If the issue has since been resolved, you won’t have to do anything further.""
I later find out my case has been deleted altogether without receiving any contact from EA... All I am asking if they can give me back my old club that I have spent so much time, effort and money to build it to where it was, as it was an honest mistake buying coins off a website. There is no way I would risk spending $23 on buying coins off a website when I spent so much more on packs! I simply didn't know. Can someone from EA please get back to me and help me with my request."
603,2,"Wow EA you really know how to rip off your customers! I get it, to get the best team in Madden (MUT) you will have to be spending some money and I understand that. I have bought a few pack, but yesterday I bought another one of your most expensive packs the big game bundle which cost around $100.Obviously, one would think the more something cost the more value it would have? Wrong. Not with EA Sports which should be renamed EA Scamsters.
After starting to open the packs one after another doubles of the same players was stacked in my bundle. Over and over the same players in the same positions. Literally when done I went and counted the doubles of players which came to a total of 31. This never happened before with me so I went to EA sports customer support and told a girl named Mary the story and all what she could say was, ""Sorry that's how it work and we can do nothing."" If you charge people a premium price for a premium pack don't rip them. That was definitely the final straw for me with them. Goodbye EA."
604,2,"EA is a bunch of scam artists. Over the years, the games made by EA Sports have become increasingly ""pay to win"". The 2018 editions of their sports games has been the last straw with me. The games are absolutely loaded with microtransactions. For example, one of my favorite game modes in the Madden series is draft champions. It's a mode where players get to complete a quick draft involving many elite players from current day and from the past. Then players get to play against one another. Really fun I must say.
But, now this year Madden 18 changed draft champions into MUT Champions and now requires 5 tickets to enter each time. What happens when you're out of tickets? Either you play hours of boring solo challenges just hoping that one of the packs you earn contains more tickets. Or, you can pay a nice price of $3 for 5 more tickets. This is absolute **. I bought the damn game. I should be able to turn on my Xbox and play the game mode I want whenever I want. I should not have to buy more tickets."
605,3,"I used to be a huge EA fan until recently when I discovered that someone has linked their EA account to my PlayStation network account. I purchased the most recent Madden a couple weeks ago and when the game downloaded, and the update did as well I started the game and the EA login page popped up but an email I didn't recognize said was linked to my PSN already. So I contacted PlayStation. They couldn't help so I got a hold of someone at EA who said they could help me with my problem. I thought finally going to be able to play an EA game on my PlayStation but then they tell me they can't do anything unless I have access to the email in question. I tell them I don't have any way of getting access to it then they say there's nothing they can do.
Pretty much ruining my opinion on EA entirely and for a company that's supposedly all about their customers this feels like a punch in the face to someone who has purchased EA games since I was a kid. So as of now I will no longer be purchasing any form of EA games or products until this gets resolved. And I know this won't be a huge problem for them but it more pisses me off that they won't do anything about someone else linking my PSN to their EA account. If I could go lower than a 1 star I would for this rating. EA I hope you see this because your handling of customers accounts is… and I know I'm not the only person who has had this problem. I've seen a lot of forums about it and it just seems like you don't want to deal with it which is terrible customer service."
606,1,"Ultimate Team is a massive scam! To buy good players you need to spend money ($100's). The players are found when you open packs or when you save up enough coins to buy them. The high rated players are virtually impossible to acquire due to their cost on the transfer market. You can earn coins by playing matches but the amount of matches one would have to play to acquire e.g. Ronaldo would be thousands. In previous versions, items listed on the transfer market were accompanied with a player I.D. so buyers could identify who they were purchasing players from. This feature has now vanished and so EA can simply duplicate player cards/item cards at will. Therefore player prices can be forced up or down at the whim of the game developer. I've spent thousands of dollars on FIFA Ultimate Team and never been able to play with the top players in my squad. It's a big scam!"
607,1,"I can't take Madden anymore. LOL. I'm going back to NCAA 14. I started over with the new Columbus Explorers and in the draft they called me the panhandlers. Wtf. These lazy EA. First they don't let me actually customize my team or stadium, now they don't even get the name right. The last great game was NCAA Football 14. If you have that model for Madden and add the new catches then you got yourself a great game. You guys put out. Ultimate team is complete garbage, franchise mode has become a sad joke. The gameplay is all stiff and scripted. Even with 99 carry a QB fumbles every time he gets hit. Zone coverage are just pilons. I can't take it anymore. Going back to NCAA football 14. More like football, better modes, real customization, better formation subs, better overall hands down. EA you should be as hamed."
608,3,"First let me start by saying I have never had a problem with EA (ELECTRONIC ARTS) but last week I came home from work, turned my game on, Was locked out, after contacting EA at least 20 time to dispute the action taken against me. They replied with automated emails explaining that I have to wait 72 hours. On Five days later they emailed me saying that their ban will stand and they will look into this matter no more. I did nothing wrong so I would like to know what investigation did EA do to prove I violated terms of service? Because I did not. It's clear that I got hacked. Shouldn't EA look out for a loyal customer like myself?
Instead they punish me. There is no one to help in situations like this, you cannot talk to the decision makers at EA in no way, shape or form, their customer service department can't help with things of this matter. So where do people like us stand? Who do we turn to? I spend a lot of time and money on this game for them to do as they wish, so who can help?
This is The website I went on (fifautrewards.com) which I thought this was an official ea site, I don't know if it is or not but this is the only thing I can see that would cause this problem. Please check this site out. Attached is the proof that if my account was compromised it would have been from here between the 2 or 3 of April. Please check out this. As I have stated before I never broke any rules. And if there was any transfer of players or coins ask yourself why I would have an account for so many years and have a great team including non tradable Suarez. I don't have another account to transfer anything to... so if that's the case please track the coins and IP addresses. You will see that my only fault was to go on that site if it's not an eat site. Please look into this matter. I AM INNOCENT."
609,2,"EA sports seems to believe that basic business ethics and customer service do not apply to them.

What is even more appalling, is that there is no actual person to speak to; only automated e-mails that still take days to reach your inbox. It is simply unfathomable that a company can do these things in this day and age.
I have been playing FIFA 17 for 4 years and also enjoyed the experience. This year, like the other years, I loved my time playing. However, one day my account was hacked into and all of my team was sold off. All the hours and money I spent building a team in the game was gone. This was just the beginning. When I attempted to contact EA customer service, they told me to wait and see if it was a glitch with their servers. 20 minutes later, my account was banned; meaning I could not play the game that I paid for any longer. I tried to contact them again, but was told that the Terms of Service department (TOS team) is in charge of the bans and they do not have a phone number. Rather, you have to write an e-mail disputing the account ban.
I did exactly what they told me to do, and provided all the details as well as hard evidence that I did nothing wrong and that all of my items were stolen from me. 4 days later, an automated response comes back saying that the decision to ban my account was final and that the case was closed. No phone number, no reason, no explanation. Simply, I can no longer play a game that I purchased and invest hours and money into. This is how they treat dedicated customers. You can imagine where their priorities truly lie. Never buying an EA product again."
610,1,"First of all why have ratings when they mean absolutely nothing? I play the game for months to get a specific player 99 overall Michael Vick with a 97 speed and he is getting run down by defensive tackles who are 5 yards back going full speed. Why??? And the phantom fumbles cheesy drop catches and absurd interceptions, etc. I could go on and on.
I just wonder that the game favor the players that put more money into the game because there seems to be a little, lopsided favoritism and it's kind of frustrating for a game that supposed to be realistic. Again I ask, ""Why have ratings when they mean absolutely nothing?"" Speed catching, trucking, etc. just take the ratings off and just say it's a free-for-all, it don't matter, instead making you think you're getting a better player. It's false advertising and don't get me wrong. I gave it a chance and practiced... practiced so I'm hitting all the right buttons. It's a joke. I created this account because I kept giving it a chance but it's still just crap. Do not purchase this game until they fix this."
611,1,"I hate to have to write this because I love playing this game but do yourself a favor and save a bunch of Frustration and don't even download this game!!! I play this game with my son and we really like playing it because it's fun to collect the best team!!! But the system crashes all the time and if you're in the middle of playing it, you lose whatever you were playing! This is super frustrating when you're trying to save up for a player and you keep losing fans!! Like that isn't bad enough but I have lost the majority of my coins on numerous occasions which is the main currency, so it's basically like losing your life savings on a bunch of times!!!
The worst part is I contacted EA Sports multiple times about it and they basically called me a liar!! Like I'm going to waste my precious time to make up some like this!!! I have better things to do than to lie to a bunch of nerds!!! It speaks volumes as to how this company is run!! I own and run a company too and I would never call a customer a liar. If a customer takes the time to tell you that there is a problem, you need to listen especially when it has been happening for so long and to so many people (just look at your message boards)!
This is why E.A sports has such a bad reputation!!! They are too worried about putting just anything out so they can make money than taking their time to put out an actual good product!!!! Just remember EA Sports if it wasn't for us paying customers you wouldn't have a company so I suggest you start listening to your fan base, otherwise well you know what they say, the bigger you are the harder you fall!! I can't wait for another company to come along!!!"
612,1,"Just to put into perspective how horrible this company is, I literally created an account here just to give them a review. I have officially vowed to never purchase another game as long as it has been stained with the diseased rot that is the EA Sports logo. Fans and consumers alike have been ignored time and time again just, so this greedy company can bathe in the profit raked in from their sports licenses. EA Sports has ruined the idea of playing football or soccer in video game format for me. Those are the only two that I've played, but I am almost positive that any other sports game created by this poisonous company is just as bad. The worst part is if it were just the sports games it would be ok, but it's everything. I am genuinely praying that EA goes bankrupt at some point in the future, so I can finally play a game a football without wanting to literally light the game on fire when I turn it off."
613,1,"I have been buying FIFA for almost 20 years now and in my opinion this FIFA 17 is by far the worst one they have ever made. There is no defense as far as headers go, the gameplay is too slow, the glitches are awful and whoever is creating the gameplay obviously has never actually played soccer before because it is extremely unrealistic. You would think after all these years they could get it right but they obviously are too lazy to put the real work in for change. I am giving it a 1 star because the only things they changed from last year was not for the better but only made to game worse. It was much better even in 2015 and I would take that game over this trash any day. I want my money back for this game, but I doubt EA Sports will even do that. I honestly will never recommend or buy another EA Sports game ever again especially FIFA games."
614,1,"For sake people it's your lot that keeps this pile of franchise going. They haven't made an honest FIFA since 98, too many buttons, glitches in the players, no tackling prowess, no passing or shooting accuracy. I went to FIFA 15 thinking they would sort all this franchise, all it is is predictive footballing, passes going to the wrong player, can't tackle worth a damn, totally biased toward the computer team, the AI is non existent, fed up of losing games but controlling the games because the glitches in players when they go in for tackles. There's 1 new thing I noticed on 15, you have the ball, you move forward and as you press r1 and triangle for a lobbed through ball, the player stops and lets the ball slightly move forward, but the player stays where he is, so he loses the ball, glitch, glitch, glitch, on all your players.
The change player on manual is…, most of the time it changes to the wrong player, over biasness toward the computer team from the ref. The amount of free kick, penalties he does my team for but their team can hack me down from anywhere, even behind, and no free kick. Please EA you can't write AI for the computer team so you handicap my team to make it not even equal. Before you go into the match, your madden is just as... Do me a favour and bin this franchise once and for all. I hope this gets sent to you because you clearly can't make a non predictive football sim to save your lives. 90% gameplay what a load of…, minus 100% gameplay. I don't buy your game because it looks good, I buy it in the hope that you will fix this franchise or just bin it. Pro Evo is too! But at least you can tackle on that game.
Any other game maker please make an honest football sim and not this predictive crap. We've been spoon fed since FIFA 2000. EA if you're going to keep making football sims, give us a PlayStation 3 re-make of the brilliant FIFA 98. The computer doesn't beat me with talent. No it up my gameplay, and handicaps my team. Not fair predictive, to watch when you lose 1-0 so many times, and when you look at the read up of the game you've had 12 shots, 8 on target, the computer has 1- shot, 1 on target, or 3-shot 2 on target. Doesn't add up.
Please, please, people do like I have done after buying this last piece of from EA cheats. I don't buy this anymore and I will do my utmost to put all my friends off this cheating predictive footballing franchise. The players even slower than the computers, but out of it all the tackling is total rubbish. So my rating of the whole franchise since 2000 is don't just bin it, get all copies of all years from 2000 on and have a big bonfire. No wonder I heard you delete all bad reviews of your crap so that people will keep buying this shit!!!"
615,1,"I've played FIFA all my life and I'm fed up at this point. The game is so inconsistent. I've tried and tried to just forget it and move past it but honestly it's.... Why is my goalie sliding on his butt moving his arms out of the way when it's right to him. And if I have a guy with 90 control how is he so sloppy with the ball. Don't forget the new no touch dribbling works 1 out 100 times if you're lucky. Also their CPUs pick up on patterns but yours will just jog around having a great time doing nothing. If it's the final 10 mins in a game and you're down 1-0 you're telling me if I have 4 guys around the guy with a ball they wouldn't be all out pressuring him. And if you lose the ball or take a bad touch your guy is frozen or stumbles. In real life you can move after a bad touch. There is so much wrong with the game.
If you're going to make a game where you beat Chelsea 5-0 and lose to Aston Villa 2-0 how is that possible. The game is so inconsistent and it's unrealistic. Why are the formations you can choose so weird too. I don't want all my players 30 yards away from each other. And there is no movement from your CPUs. Their team picks up on patterns and if I have Bale just because he's dribbling that doesn't mean Fazio is faster than him who has a speed rating in the 30's. It's a joke. How come their goalie can save an upper 90 shot and mine can't even jump up and grab a ball that was cleared into the air. Also if I have Marcos Rojo and they have Benteke and there is a cross how is Benteke just 1 foot over him pushing him out of the way getting in front and power heading it right to De Gea who of course missed it because the game is fixed. The game completely messes with your team. It's like if you're gonna be bad at least be consistent.
I see so much movement one game and none the next. And you're telling me that Rojo can't go up for a header or get in the way so it's not a goal and force him into a bad header. Also refs suck. If I'm getting my jersey pulled and hacked and unfair tackles and I slide and get the ball how is mine a foul and theirs isn't. Plus you're saying Neymar can't outrun a slow outside back and what's funny is that they know what you're gonna do. They basically know I'm gonna cut inside and then of course it's an automatic goal on a counter attack cross. I want it to seem like I'm playing a real person not a computer. If I have Neymar Depay and Rooney up top how come neither one of them can dribble score or cross it. It's an absolute joke. EA is a joke. I hate to say it but I might switch to PES because I want to play the same that I love and I want a good game.
Stop saying you have all new mechanics and a brand new updated changed game. It's the same game with new updates to ratings. Messi is not a 96. He cuts, he's fast and he shoots. Nothing more. Plus skill moves like rolling the ball and stuff like that shouldn't take me to switch my hand position just so I can't hold L2 and use the right stick when it doesn't even do the right move that I want it to do. It's a joke and I'm done. EA I'm done. Also 2k16 sucks. If a guy blocks me do you see people in real life freeze dribble the ball 5 times and then get back up? No you don't because that doesn't happen. Be realistic and consistent or stop making shot games. It's a joke and so is your company. NHL they pass behind the goal and pass to the front and goal all because my CPUs can't adjust and do something useful.
You suck EA. You can kiss my ass. Make your game realistic and consistent. Even if it's consistently bad at least I know what I'm buying. If you make a game where Ronaldo can make a pass then but can't do it later when it's a short drop pass then goodbye. You make my team so good in one game and then… suck in the next because you control the CPUs in the background. Also if a ball is in the air why is the guy farthest away running in to go get the header. There's a… guy right below. Just let him go up and get it. It's a complete joke and I'm done with your… EA. I'm done and so are others."
616,2,I've been playing Madden games for many years now. And I've had a hard time building my team so I purchase packs and get nothing but garbage. Packs full of people that are not worth anything! If I'm paying 60 dollars for the game and spend additional money on packs at least have the respect to give people that are spending their hard earned dollar decent players. It seems to me if you don't have a YouTube page with over 2K likes you don't get nothing. I watch people YouTube videos and they pull 90s players out of every pack. This game is totally unfair... That's why this will be the last EA game that I own. I'm not the only one that feels this way either. All my other friends feel the same!!!
617,1,"Never buy a EA product. A once great dynasty and franchise has whittled down to nothing. They care not for their customers or the product they are selling. If you want a great EA game purchase Madden 2005. That's the last time they truly cared about their products. Ultimately buying a modern version of the game would be a subpar polished version of 2005 game without them forcing you to purchase extra to have a somewhat decent gaming experience. They are truly the worst company in America. That is not a exaggeration. The management does not care about the customer. If you have a problem with the company, they will not help you. Don't waste your time calling them. Just report them to a consumer report."
618,1,"This is why monopolies are BAD FOR THE CONSUMER. Since EA has bought the exclusive rights to the NFL/NHL, these games have been subpar at best and downright BETA at worst. It's clear that they do NOT spend much money on programming and instead sink money into marketing and promotion. Their customer support is condescending. Game play is usually clunky. They never add more than one feature to any game per year.
I did not buy Madden 16 (it was given to me) and I would like to give it back. Overly complicated game play made so to distract you from obvious game script errors and subpar AI on the human team. Same with NHL. The game often plays like old 80's electronic football except with hockey players. Many times, it's as if your teammates don't even know what sport they play. Other times you can't select the player that is closest to the play. Still more times it feels like passing is using a 4 direction D-pad. They don't care, they don't even try, and it's criminal how much money they steal every year. I honestly wish there were a way to sue them for this."
619,3,"On Friday 1/15/16 I attempted to buy Madden 16 points to purchase packs. The message ""no point offers available"" continued to appear. I then logged into The Playstation store and purchased points from there, however the points were never credited to my account. I searched the internet for the issue to see if there was another step and found others with the issue that said to wait 24 hours. I waited 48+ before contacting EA. Your only option is to live chat or email. I decided to chat. I waited 45 minutes to get someone. I was then told to use a link that was broken. After explaining the link didn't work, they sent me another link that then disconnected me.
I went back thru the process to live chat and this time waited over an hour before getting an advisor. I was told I needed to submit screenshots of 3 things, which I did. The person spoke terrible English and told me that I had cropped the images, which I hadn't. I did a print screen and pasted them into word. The transaction in question was right at the top. After submitting screenshots in paint instead I was told that my case could not be fixed because the submissions were invalid. I did exactly what they told me to do, but she or he couldn't tell me exactly what to do because they didn't understand what I was saying. They then said, ""Let us know if there is anything else we can help you with."" Umm you didn't fix anything.
I then decided to go the email route in which I attached all the necessary information. When they responded they said (in poor English) that they understood that I had lost coins and never received my player. NOT WHAT MY PROBLEM WAS! They then proceeded to tell me that due to the level of work needed to investigate I risked losing my account if they found it to be fraudulent. Considering my user name and the information about my case was inaccurate, I had zero faith in pursuing the matter as I may lose the hundreds of dollars I had put into the game over their incompetence. I guess it's ok for them to take your money, not give you what you paid for and then treat you like crap and waste your time when you try to get it."
620,2,"Without any confirmation via email or phone, an unknown person was able to access and change the email corresponding to my account. There is no functioning US customer support phone number and the only way to contact live support is to be logged in to your account. Having my account stolen and living in the US, I am left with no means to contact EA. I have no account to log into live chat with and no number to call. Email response was speedy but unhelpful. I was told to call the UK or log in for live chat which I had explained I could not do. Thanks EA. First you slowly destroy all your franchises by making them hand holder games and now, you can't even protect your customers?"
621,2,"1st off placed order November 24th. It's now December 22nd and still no trampoline. Why? Stayed on phone 4 different days over 2 hours each time trying to hold for customer service, yeah guess what... never got anyone! Oh don't bother trying to chat either, tried 10 different times and says no agents available? So, last resort emailed them. 3 days later each time, ""Oh we assure you will have your trampoline. Our shipping company we use has been behind."" Funny they take their money out soon as you hit purchase and tell you 7-14 days shipping but couple days shy of 30 days now and biggest thing is my son won't get his Christmas gift! Called a store manager. Talked it over. ""Sorry can't help you, no refund available at this time."" This is the 1st and LAST TIME I will buy from Academy. PERIOD!"
622,3,"I was trying to place an online order, but got a message that there was a problem processing the order and that I need to contact the credit card company. Before I placed the order, I made sure that the shipping address was different from the billing address. After I got the initial message about problems with processing the order, I noticed that the billing address was that of the shipping, so I thought that maybe I didn't correct it. I corrected it and placed my order the second time, thinking that was the problem. Well, lo and behold, I got the same error message.
I contacted their online support because the failed charges showed up on my card. Online support said that whether or not my order goes through, there will still be authorization charges and that it will fall off the account in 3-5 business days. That does not make sense! If there is a problem placing any order on any other website, the company will not put through authorization charges at all. After I asked why my order did not go through, the agent disconnected our conversation. It took forever to get a hold of anyone to speak with. Poor customer service!!! I would rate my experience a zero."
623,1,"My company distributes Academy gift cards to employees and clients during the Christmas season. Last year, we tried to purchase the cards at a local store and the entire process was a nightmare with 1/2 a work day wasted. This year, we decided to order the cards online to try and avoid the in store issues we had last year. No better service. The cards were ordered online and the initial order was declined. We found that Academy has limit to the amount of cards you are able to purchase. Nowhere on the website does it say there is a limit - issue #1. Next, we could not re-order the cards until 24-48 hours had passed. I had to contact customer service to order the cards, which meant sitting on hold for over 45 minutes - issue #2. Once cards were ordered, we had to wait 3-5 days before arrival. Cards arrived, required to call back in to customer service and give an activation code that was sent to me via email - issue #3. After sitting on hold for 37 minutes, an employee answered the phone but was not able to assist me because ""she was new and had only been working there for 2 weeks"". She kept me on hold for another 22 minutes only to tell me someone would have to call me back - issue #4. She stated she was sending an email to the person who would be activating the cards and I would get a call ""as soon as she received the email"". This call took place at approximately 1:30pm and no one called me back before the end of day at 6:00pm. It is December 12, we have Academy gifts that were supposed to arrive on 12/8 that did not arrive until 12/11, are not activated because of horrible customer service practices, and I am still unable to distribute to customers and employees. I would not recommend Academy to anyone looking to distribute large numbers of gift cards during the holiday season. Find any other vendor you can before selecting Academy."
624,2,"Tried to place an order online. Received an error message that said my order didn't go through and to place my order again. The second order went through and so did my first attempt to place an order! Called customer service - I've been on hold for over 1 hour so far! Website says that chat is available... That's a lie. It's been ""searching for an available agent"" for 50 minutes so far. Finally they answer and say they cannot the order and to call back for a return shipping label after I receive the extra order. So waste another hour or pay return shipping. The way they do business I don't trust that I'd ever get a refund. I've heard they don't refund, only send gift cards for their stores. Never again."
625,3,"Attempted multiple times to order online, website will not accept credit cards. They have a pre-recorded message saying, ""Call your credit card company"", evidently the company had fraud in past and has a crazy process according to my credit card companies. Academy told me to have credit card companies remove suppression, both companies said there was no suppression on the accounts. So customer is just out of luck due to Academy current practices. After waiting another 45 minutes I got a customer service person who did apologize, but had no control over management decisions. Very poor business practice. Not responsive to customers, would rate them very low."
626,3,"I ordered 2 pairs of the Magellan Sportsman 800 Boot Foot Waders (11/26/17). It says you should expect delivery in 3-5 business days. I'm thinking awesome. They'll be here at least by the 1st of December and I can go fishing on Saturday the 2nd. First it takes them 4 days just to pack and purchase shipping label for the order. Then FedEx (the best shipping company) does their part like they always do 3 days it arrives (12/2/17). But all isn't lost. I can still go Sunday morning early before football right!!? Wrong. I open the box pull the pair for me out to check the fit. They're not in the plastic bag and all tags were ripped off. I pull them out, start to put them on and realize they're covered in dried mud and have a finger sized hole right above the boot (Kinda defeats the purpose of waders if they're going to fill up with water while your wading).
So then I open the pair I got for my dad. And they too are covered in dried mud with no tags or packaging. So my next thought was I can't believe they just took returned ones and threw them in a box and shipped them to me. But then I'm think why would their distribution warehouse have returns? I look at shipping label and Oh they shipped my order from a Store (#0247 1650 N Hwy 77 Waxahachie TX 75165) not the warehouse. Seem any respectable company would check all returns to see if they've been damaged or show wear before putting them back out for sale and then sell them instore at a discount properly marked. Also if I order something that isn't labeled as used or damaged packaging ETC. I expect it to be new and unused and sealed in original packaging."
627,3,"I went to Academy Sports website on 11/19/17 looking for new shoes for work. I found the shoes I really wanted, they were on clearance, and 2 business day shipping was available for an additional $10. I needed them to handle Black Friday at work. How perfect! Paying online didn't work due to the fact that at no point do they consider that a person may have a middle initial on their card. I had 2 cards rejected, and my MasterCard had a fraud hold put on it. I fixed the problem that evening, and the order went through. On 11/21, I fixed the fraud hold, and then got an email from Academy. Delivery will be on 11/25/17. 2 business days? And the day after Black Friday? Worst experience ever."
628,3,"Went to Academy Sports on Outerloop, Louisville Ky, went there to possibly purchase a Beretta ARX 100, we get to the counter, and ask the guy if I can check it out. He tells me that he needs to run my license just to see it, and then I asked why, he said it's a new policy. So I give it to him, because I don’t have anything to hide, like I said I just bought three here over the summer, and they didn’t ask to run my license just to check it out.
He gets on a computer, starts doing something with my license, then 5 minutes later, he tells me that I'm on a do not sell list, so I can’t even look at it, like I said I just bought 3, 1000 rifles, and I've never been in trouble my whole life. I feel like I was lied to and I'm not sure what he did with my license on that computer, so we start to argue.
This is bs, tells me, kids and wife that we can't come back in there, and if we do hell call the cops and we'll get arrested, then bows up on my wife and pretty much pushes us out the door, but when we ask why, no answers, just rude. Tells my wife in her face to get the ** OUT. We had just left Cabela's. Right before arriving at this nightmare, we had no problems there, but Cabela's didn’t have the rifle we wanted, so I'm not sure what can be done about this. Was totally treated like…, worst experience of my life, and were faithful shoppers here. He had my id, not sure what he's capable of doing with my information. Please any advice would be great!"
629,1,"Over a month and a half with no item. I have yet to receive my item that I purchased August 31, 2017 and it is now October 19, 2017. It has not been a pleasant experience either. I will NEVER recommend this company and especially not the company they use to ""ship/deliver"" their items. I have had 3 set delivery dates. The first one they brought the wrong item. Almost a month later another set date, the time came and went, I sat at my home for the 4 hour window and no item. When I called they didn't know where my item was and I was told that they would call me when they found it.
A week later, I called them and that was a show trying to talk to someone who knew what was going on. They finally told me that they found it and that I could schedule to have it delivered. Haha! Yeah, we still don't have it. NEVER showed up, NEVER got a call, until they wanted my review of the whole situation! So here I am giving my review WITHOUT even having my item! Thanks for a lot of stress and frustration!"
630,2,Placed order on 9/22. One time! Charged my card THREE times to the tune of $1200! It overdrew my account. Called got a rep. Got put on hold for 34 minutes. Called back. Got disconnected. Called back. Got manager who spoke very little English. Got charges reversed but now have 5 overdraft fees that they are going to pay because I will employ an attorney. Still have not received order because they just told me IT'S ON BACKORDER. Can't cancel because it's due to ship tomorrow 9/28. I'm done with Academy and will NEVER shop there again.
631,1,"This was not a great week for us at BSC, Lexington. We've been longtime loyal members supporting the club through regular attendance at the gym and the classes, my daughter over 10 years and me around 5 years. We've made many wonderful friends but this week something happened that changed our outlook of the club. You see my daughter suffers from anxiety and depression so using the gym is a fundamental part of her overall mental health. For 10 years she used the gym undisturbed and just going about her business, but the staff had no idea about her disability.
Anyway, one evening this week I received a call from her cell phone. She was clearly distressed and screaming, ""Dad a man is disrespecting me in the gym."" Without hesitation I jumped into my car and sped quickly to see what was going on. Upon arrival at BSC, Lexington I found her near the entrance sobbing her heart out. There were no staff consoling her. Just the general public. She had just finished using an elliptical machine and in her haste forgot to clean it down as we sometimes do. An older man who had been using another elliptical machine, left his machine, waited for her to finish up in the lady’s room, then chased and stalked her up the stairs and confronted in a loud voice at the front desk, yelling, ""You did not clean your machine down.""
In the meantime, the staff heard the exchange and did nothing about it. Clearly my daughter's anxiety flew into overdrive and all she could see and hear is this huge older man pursuing her. So when I arrived she escorted me in her distressed state to the older man who was still working out on the machine. As a father of a disabled child I was firstly surprised at the lack of attention from the floor staff who clearly must have seen what was happening. So I did what any dad would do. I confronted the creep, grabbed him by the shirt collar and I warned that if he ever treated my daughter like that again he would feel my wrath. Clearly, he was shaken by this time as all bullies are.
This finally got the attention of staff who escorted my daughter and I out of the gym to one of the offices. In the meantime we were told the man would be escorted out and barred from the gym. We called the police as well who were helpful given the situation and escorted the man out of the gym. Bottomline: The gym manager called me the next day to say my membership would be revoked for threatening physical violence but that the offender would continue his membership. My daughter and I argued that the man could have brought the matter to the attention of the staff instead of stalking and yelling at her all the way to front desk.
There are multiple machines scattered around the gym so this could have been avoided. In my opinion, this clearly indicates weaknesses in the BSC Lexington club procedures. It is not entirely safe or sympathetic or mindful of the safety of young girls and women since they should have at a minimum recognized what was happening and acted swiftly. Instead the offender creep was allowed to continue working out undisturbed until I decided to act. In the meantime I've lost my membership and my daughter canceled hers citing lack of safety for people like her. Shame on you BSC, Lexington. This should never happen to anyone again."
632,1,"If you have to save your money and time, steer clear of this business. We went to inquire and were lured to use their $1 each for 2 months no contract scheme to try their business and if we liked it, we were going to be enrolled. Until today I have not expressed my like in any form or factor, however noticed that my card on file was charged an annual fee the end of the first month. There was no communication prior and I just discovered I was charged while checking my expenses. When I called the desk at Westborough to understand how this could have happened, the tone in which I was handled switched from the sweet talks that were used to sell to, there is no way out, no way you will be refunded even if you chose to give up on the trial period and did not want to use the premise.
All this when I have no binding with Boston Sports Club. The manager Tom said and I quote ""yes ma'am, you can write scores of reviews on Yelp or anywhere you choose and we are used to that. You are not getting your money back"". Looks like they have chosen to make money by pilfering from people instead of providing service as that is something they are not capable of. Steer clear of this business as they definitely waste your time."
633,2,"HORRIBLE!!! Unscrupulous customer service and business practices!! I called the last week of February to freeze my membership. I spoke to Howard, after I gave him my name and he looked me up, he recognized me right away. He asked me what was going on, and I explained my situation. He said, ""No problem I'll put it in the computer right away, you're all set."" I was charged my full membership rate for March. I called BSC Lynnfield, and as soon as someone answered I asked to speak to a manager. She would NOT hand me over to a manager until I explained exactly why I wanted to speak to a manager. I went through my entire story, she looked me up in the computer (after I spelled out my last name and she repeated it back to me), and told me I was not in their system. After a few more tries she located my account and told me there was no note in my account about requesting a freeze on my membership. I became quite frustrated, and I waited on the phone while she explained my situation to a manager. The manager got on the phone and asked me what was going on. He acted as if he had ZERO knowledge as to why I was calling. I heard the employee tell him exactly why I was calling. So, again I go through why I am calling. He completely disregarded me, and absolutely refused to believe that I did in fact have a phone conversation with Howard in February. This is just inexcusable!!! He was rude and disrespectful. He told me there was nothing he could do, except offer me a credit for a month after my freeze was over. A future credit absolutely does not excuse the carelessness and attitude I received. I was told the only way to cancel my membership was in person. I went in this morning to cancel, and the girl behind the desk hit a few buttons on the computer and told me I was all set. I said, ""That's it, I don't need to sign anything."" She told me, ""No."" That was a complete waste of my time!!! Of course this could have been done over the phone. Their business practices, communication and customer service are simply a joke!"
634,3,"I have used five different BSC sites, and use the South End and Wellesley facilities weekly. Each one has its good points. Some are clean, some seem to keep their machines working pretty well. But there is an underlying lack of responsiveness to all consumer concerns. Sometimes, it is a lack of cleanliness, or the absence of towels, or machines that have been broken for a month, or televisions tuned to an infomercial channel that can't be changed. Repeated calls and emails to managers go unreturned. You are told ""the contract is online"" without any verification, and certainly nothing in writing.
When I upgraded my membership to join the Wellesley club, I was told, twice, that there would be no charge except for the monthly fee increase. I laughed: why would they expect me to pay extra in order to have the privilege of paying more each month? I laughed until I got my credit card statement with a $69.99 charge. Multiple emails and phone calls have not been returned. I will go there in person and I'm sure I will hear that this is something I agreed to. But it isn't."
635,1,"Wellington Circle Boston Sports Club - I had a membership from 2016-2017 end of the contract. I called in July 2017. Told that was fine and that my membership was cancelled. They have continued to bill me. Have talked to Dan who now says you have to send a certified letter. They even sent me a letter saying as a ""former member"" but now they are saying it never happened. They will not let me quit. I called three times yesterday and they put me on hold. If they ever did pick up the phone they were rude and basically bullied. ""You cannot do it without this additional letter, we need to review it to find out if you owe us any more money.""
It's nothing but a scam. They also lied and said that I yelled at someone, how can you do it when they just put you on hold. Our only hope is the Dept of Consumer Protection and the Attorney General's office. they still will NOT let me quit. There also is a Nicole that would not let me quit. This is against the law. I have NEVER dealt with such mean and bullying people."
636,1,"Wellington Circle, Medford, MA - In mid-July I went in person to the front desk and canceled my membership. Now is September and they still charging my debit card monthly. They told me that I was all set canceling my membership back then. Trying to resolve it today (09/02/17)... No use. Horrible customer service from management. I felt like I was lying about the whole situation. Just ridiculous. Manager was very rude. I checked other reviews from this establishment, and looks like I'm not alone. There are so many complaints about them. I wished I knew it before signing a contract in the first place. Horrible experience. Nobody needs this type of service."
637,2,"It is a nightmare to cancel, I've tried multiple times to cancel my account, but it happens that whenever I call to cancel ""the person who does it"" is never in... A month later I was finally able to cancel, July 25th and 6 days later was billed the $49.95 annual fee and $29.95 cancellation fee. I am fine with the cancellation fee but being billed for an annual fee for something I have been trying to cancel for over a month is a little absurd. My charges also increased from $19.95 to $29.95 monthly without a notice. Yes, I did check my emails for the ""mass email sent to all BSC members"". I did not receive one. I called the 1-800 number and Karen was quite frank about it. Stating it is my fault for not canceling before July, and the mass email was sent a month before the charges increased, sounded like she was reading a script meant for every customer that calls with the same issue."
638,2,"The Health club charges a lot. I joined for the warm pool due to needing it for physical therapy. Most people using pool are there for orthopedic issues as it's a therapeutic pool. There are very limited hours for adults to use this pool and this is not advertised when joining. Pool hours are geared toward swim lessons and Kids swim hours and only 3 to 4 hours a day are allotted to adults for adult swim.
During adult swim, every weekend, there is a man with autism who screams constantly and at times grabs or hits people in pool. His mom swims and pays little attention to him, causing him to act out more. When they arrive, the warm pool clears out, limiting adult swim hours more. Management has told me they receive numerous complaints about this and will speak to mom about supervising the man. They have not done their job to manage this and it is unsafe and unpleasant to be in the pool. Since I work during weekdays, weekends are the only time I Can access pool, I've discontinued membership due to such limited access and safety issue."
639,3,"I have belonged to this group of fitness clubs for ten years in Washington, Philadelphia, and currently Boston. The Downtown Crossing location of Boston Sports Club is among the worst locations I have visited. Most issues stem from management's laziness. The free weights are not cleaned regularly to the point where it is possible to smell them from ten feet away. The men's locker room is often in disarray over the weekends with locker doors hanging off of their hinges, dirty towels laying all over the room, and standing pools of water near the shower area. The shower stalls themselves are an absolute mess. There are swarms of living flies in the stalls and members smash them against the shower walls which are never cleaned. In addition to the dead bugs, it's easy to tell that the staff doesn't clean the stalls because there has been a wet paper towel on the floor of one of the stalls every day for the past two weeks. Since management doesn't employ a cleaning person during the weekend, the locker room just gets worse and worse despite multiple staff members being on duty who are otherwise unoccupied and could clean up instead of sitting around. The conditions are so bad that this past weekend, one of the three toilets was clearly out of order, but used by a member anyway. Instead of fixing this or at least blocking off the area, the problem just sat there and will likely remain that way until Monday. In addition to just being generally disgusting, these things are health hazards. The worst part about this gym is that there is a well documented and chronic condition of laziness on the part of management. Read these reviews or those on Yelp and Google. There's nothing worse than a gym whose management is clearly aware of these types of issues and too lazy to do anything about it. That says everything you need to know in terms of how they view their patrons."
640,1,"Horrible services - the staff are rude, impatient and all I do is see them standing around talking. No one is ever actually working. Whenever a customer has an issue, the staff hide in the back office and pretend that they are busy. One of the front desk staff Nicole clearly does drugs - she can't even stand to check you in and slurs all her words. An absolute disgrace. The bathrooms are absolutely disgusting. There is never hair conditioner, ever. The sauna and steam room are broken at LEAST twice a month...
Such a waste of money for ""extra amenities"" that are never available for use. The hot tub is also almost always out of service so that's another wasted amenity charge. There is always confusion with credit card charges, freezing, canceling, adding or editing the account. They are only concerned with getting money and not being ripped off. Yet the consumers yet nothing in return, horrible customer service and little to offer at over charged prices. What a disgrace. Can't wait for latitude sports clubs to gain more popularity in the area, Boston sports club sucks."
641,2,"To be sure, the main reason I started BSC years ago was its proximity to work, that and the fact that I can use NYSC when I am in New Jersey are the only reasons I still have a membership. Among other things they recently dropped the guest feature of my membership which I would use a few times a month when my partner visited me. We argued at the front desk but were just told there was nothing they could do because it was a rule sent down by ""corporate"". Likewise, my partner was using NYSC and had been using a trainer there for months - he learned that the trainer was receiving only 30% of what he paid, so he canceled and now sees the same guy at a different gym, saving a lot of money overall.
BSC Lexington was where I started. It was small to begin with, but when they insisted on inserting their green carpeted cross-fit area, the place became a nightmare - you couldn't even move between equipment. In the summers they have a ""summer camp"" for kids, which absorbs a portion of the already limited parking with an activity area and tent, and they open their outdoor pool to the public, so they are making more money, and mini-vans typically take up every available space at the time I'm getting out of work - and I'm the one with a membership, but of course they don't care if I can't park.
BSC Waltham has only slightly more equipment but the layout is much larger so it's easier to maneuver. Even with the large staff, they're typically just sitting around, meanwhile the locker room has a pile of used towels so high that you're in danger of an avalanche. I was a member at Work Out World for over two years. The location I went to had a LOT of equipment, some older but always well-maintained, locker rooms were gross but not unlike any other gym, and you didn't get a free towel service. But for only $10 per month and a $45-year fee, I could afford to buy a new towel each time I went. I had heard some horror stories about ending the WOW membership as well, but I simply did what they asked and wrote a letter to the company requesting cancellation and it was done - no problems. I'm astonished at the number of complaints about billing issues that some agency hasn't stepped in to do something."
642,3,"Unlawful, hostile workout environment at the Boston Sports Club. The unprofessional behavior by the staff and gym members. I truly believe this is a political issues and discrimination because no one should be singled out everyone should be treated fairly since I am paying a monthly fee of $68.00. I trained with a personal trainer in 2014 and my sessions was cancelled numerous times. And at one session, another person was training with me on my session that I paid for. And when I check-in at the front desk, the staff has this tendency of touching my hands, constant mocking when I hand over my key card.
It happened for the past year or 2, women in the locker room airing their naked body which is disrespectful. I was attack by one of their members and I believe the person is a staff at the club, I cannot confirm at this time. I truly believe this is discrimination against me. I don't think anyone has the right to harass someone. It is considered a crime. I did report it to the police but the outcome was I do not have enough evidence, but the individual has made attempts towards me in the gym. I believe I have all rights to workout at any facilities and not be discriminated. It's unfair, unprofessional. Please address this problem."
643,2,"I called today to cancel my gym membership with Boston Sports Club of Lynnfield MA, I believe I spoke with Dianna. Well I explained I wanted to cancel my membership which is $40 month to month and she asked what my reason for canceling the membership was, I told her I am going to be moving out of state. After I told my reason she stated that I cannot cancel because I am on a 1 year contract, I then stated I never agreed to sign anything and was never told I was on a 1 year contract, I was told it was $40 month to month only. She then states if I am moving out of state I would need to show proof of new out of state address... Well that made me very unhappy because that could take weeks. Which means they will continue to take my hard earned money out of my bank account which is not fair. If anyone can help please let me know, I was thinking of calling the attorney general's office."
644,1,"On April 15, 2015, I saw club manager Bill ** in his office for the purpose of ending my BSC Lexington membership. He reminded me the club has a 30-day cancellation policy and my membership would be billed through May 31, 2015. I said fine, and left the office believing my membership had been cancelled. I got billed for May and paid it. I got billed for June and paid it by mistake. I got billed for July and called MasterCard to contest charges.
I have since called the club three times and have been back there in person three times. In the visits both Ashley and Bill have told me I should not have been charged for June and July, but that since I had disputed the charges they could do nothing to reverse the charges, and that it was now between the credit card company and their corporate headquarters. Corporate headquarters is denying I have been overcharged and are even dunning me over the phone for being delinquent. I'm not sure this story is over yet. Anyone signing a membership agreement for this company should be very careful."
645,1,"The facilities are not bad. You have enough resources to do what you need to do. The reason I am giving a poor review was due to their customer service on billing inquiries. I had to move out the Bedford/Lexington, MA area and it is a nightmare to cancel your membership with them. They will not stop the monthly charge. I had to pay a visit in person. When I tried to speak to Ashley, the account manager of the Lexington site over the phone, it is very unresponsive and not resolving my issue. My account has been closed and 4 weeks later they just charged $150 dollar on my account for no reason. No explanation and no heads-up about it. Hoping that I will not read my credit card bill statements, so they can get away from it. That's my experience with Boston Sports Club (BSC) at this location. Just keep in mind guys."
646,2,"I have been a member of Boston Sports Clubs for 5 years. I loved it till last Friday. The story starts in March when we had some session left over from the 8 that I had that month. She told me that I need to sign for them and she just put them in the bank and honor them later. Well she miss another 3 session and then was sick before she could train on the 3 that expired making my total now five. She now miss another 4 due to a Dr appointment being sick, holidays- her boyfriend coming into town etc. It become an excuse after another. So we were up to 8 session. She thought it was six but it was 8. When I showed her the proof it was 8 she started to become very angry at me, so much so that I asked her to stop as we had already wasted 15 mins of my 1 hour session.
I said ""never mind, I just let management deal with it."" At this point she screams at me, ""I train you 8 but get a new trainer."" Then she said ""I give you 10 if you do not go online."" At this point it already gone from bad to worst. I walk out to that. She said ""I have to give these to you as no one else can get paid on it."" I said ""I want nothing to do with you."" She said, ""Fine, don't come to my classes and also you think about leaving the club as they never get rid of me,"" and run and get my bag. On the way out she responds ""Oh look at the little piggy. Going to eat her feeling in red velvet cupcakes ok ok ok. You will come crawling back to me as a big old fatty."" At this point I run to management and tell her the story. All I did was question her on what I had it was 8 and she did not want to give them to me. In the 3 years I know her I never cheated her once. what makes her think I do it now After all I loved her I followed her everywhere.
I made it very clear to BSC that I will not be treated like this and asked for a refund for the 8 I was owed and the one I did not use. I have no interest in BSC anymore and would like to join another club. They did offer me a month of free dues but that's not enough. I'm scared to death of this woman, it's like a ticking time bomb I'm not sure when it's going to explode at me. She still works there. I expect nothing less of BSC putting money before members as she makes them a lot of Money. I just want a refund for what I could not use. The manager is blowing me off and I am pretty much stuck in this club I cannot use. I just want to leave. They said they did not want me to leave with a bad taste in my mouth. Well I have one."
647,1,"After joining the Andover, MA club 7 months ago and paying $200 sign up fee (not including any month memberships) they informed us 1 month ago that the club was closing. Not only have I been charged for the babysitting after the club has been closed, but after contacting member services to request some sort of refund of my sign up fee they wouldn't budge! I explained to the woman in member services at corporate that I have been a member almost all of my adult life at different locations of theirs and that I have paid plenty of start up fees but she gave me a ""I'm sorry about that"" then remained silent on the line.
This is stealing from people. I justified paying the extra 200 to start, assuming that I would be there for a long time because it is close to my home and that the high cost would at least be dispersed over time. I am extremely disappointed in this company and I will never ever be returning! I caution anyone thinking about joining to think twice because they do not care about members."
648,3,"I had my charge card stolen and was issued a new one. I visited Boston Sports Club for Zumba class on a Saturday morning in early February. I was told that something was wrong with my membership and that I needed to resolve the problem in order to attend class or exercise there. I was told that it was OK to be there that day, but please take care of the issue right away to avoid membership interruption.
I explained the situation with my charge and asked to deal with problem and change the credit card on file for my monthly fee there and then. I was told that I could not do this at the gym but had to call the membership department at headquarters. I called that afternoon and they were closed. It was a Saturday, so I understood. However, I called twice more during regular business hours the following week and several more times the next. Not once did I get a human being on the telephone.
Finally, someone called me three weeks after my first call. I provided my new card information. I received at least five more calls asking for the card information over the next few weeks. All the while I could not use the gym. Finally, after two months, BSC finally accepted the information - the same provided two months earlier. When I told them that they owed me two months back membership, they offered me $20 ""for the inconvenience."" I told them anything less than two months was unacceptable. They have refused to answer my emails. I will not call, as I now want all communications in writing."
649,1,"BSC Lynnfield, MA training scam - I am writing to warn other gym members not to make the same mistake I did. I met with a personal trainer and was under the impression that I was signing a contract for 4 sessions at a total cost of $380. Not cheap by any means, but I really wanted to get started on a new program. My card was charged $380 and I thought I was all set. The next month my card was charged $380 again. I called the gym and they claim that I agreed to 12 sessions!! They say I signed a contract for this. I did ""electronically"" sign a document but I was under the impression that it was for 4 sessions, not 12!
When I reviewed the contract the only number on it is $380, but it also states that it’s for a minimum of three months. I misunderstood, and they refuse to take off the extra charge and will charge me a third time if I don't get a note from a doctor stating that I can't train. Now I've got 8 sessions that I don't even want to go to because I'm so upset. They also claim that if the sessions aren't used weekly, they expire! I had to go out of town because of an illness in my family. So now I've lost those sessions. I don't ever want to set foot in this place again. PLEASE be sure to read EVERYTHING and don't sign any electronic documents. Has anyone else had a similar experience?"
650,1,I moved to Chicago from Boston and was told that my membership had been cancelled. Turns out they were still charging all this time and told me that the department that I spoke to should have never told me that it was cancelled... Will never recommend or use any of their services again.
651,2,"I signed a one year contract in March of 2014. The contract does state that there will be a $39.99 rate lock protection fee charged in January. OK, makes sense. However, I told them in January that I would be cancelling my membership on the day my contract expires, since my office location has moved and going to the club is now inconvenient. I then requested a refund of the rate lock fee. I explained that since the entire time I had a membership, I was under contract, and therefore protected against a rate increase. And, since I am cancelling my membership at the end of that contract, then the Rate Lock fee is not protecting me from anything. They said that while that makes sense, they simply will not refund the fee. Businesses need to learn that not all situations are the same and they can't simply have a one-size-fits-all policy."
652,2,"When BSC changed to the 19.95/29.95 per month membership; the clientele became more like Work Out World and Planet Fitness. The gym was busier than ever and it was also dirtier than ever. I'm talking dirty towels and cups everywhere! Sweat stains on the mats, dirt on the mats, dust bunnies throughout the gym. A musty moldy smell lurked in areas where ventilation was poor. Two years ago this gym was a terrific place to work out, now it's a place to suck in mold and dirty air into your lungs.
Fed up with the lack of cleanliness in the gym, I decided it was time to take a break from BSC and join another gym. It took two weeks to get someone at my gym to answer questions regarding my membership. The GM in Newton actually fought with me on the phone, insults included. The conversation was so bizarre, I actually called TSI to confirm he was in fact the new GM. I looped the district manager in on the rude and uncomfortable conversation and he didn't provide any feedback. It's clear he doesn't care, but hey; at least he's following a trend. To be clear, I don't expect anything for free. I do expect to get what I pay for.
After a 30-min hold time with TSI, I was finally able to freeze my account. Fast forward to the first month where my monthly maintenance fees were supposed to be deducted; TSI debited two separate transactions of $15.00 a piece. They decided to take money out for a personal training membership I had cancelled months ago. It's been almost 30 days and I have yet to receive my refund. I reported the transactions as fraud to my bank and they turned off my card. I got this idea from the GM in Newton who told me if I wanted to avoid the 30 day cancellation period to just stop all payments from BSC and TSI. He told me ""nothing would happen to me, I would receive a few phone calls but eventually they would stop.""
If the GM at BSC is teaching me how to avoid the nonsense at TSI, what does that say about the company? Since calling TSI requires too much time on hold, I've resorted to emailing them and waiting several days for a response. At least I have a paper trail this way. Yes, TSI is the biggest gym owner/operator in the northeast, but their customer service reminds me of what it was like to call third world countries when I needed computer tech support in the early PC days."
653,2,"I paid $150 for two membership initiation fees, one for my son and one for myself to the Waltham club. Two months later, I called to cancel my son's membership, simply because he never really used it and I don't want to waste money to pay the monthly membership fees. Here I am not trying to get refund of initiation fee or anything, just want to stop paying for future monthly memberships. Interestingly, I was told I had to go and do it in person. So I went (before the start of September), and at the desk first I was told there was no manager.
When I argued, a manager came up and looked into computer for a second. Next he told me he needed general manager to cancel it. I left my phone number and expected a call back, but the call never came. I called a few days later after the September fee was already charged; again I was told I need to go in person. I argued in the phone (in a style beyond what I normally would do), and another manager told me they would call me back in the next couple of days, but I need to expect $150 for the cancellation fee.
I have never encountered a place like this that so shamelessly abuses their customers. Most of the time when we buy something, we can return for a refund. I am not getting any service here, but they will continue to charge my credit card, as long as they can, best forever for them."
654,1,"I was actually abused by an instructor in a group class, and we had a pretty bad confrontation. I said I would take the matter up with management, and her response was ""Go ahead!"" Now, I understand her impunity because I called management and could not get a timely response. Now I am trying to cancel and they make it as DIFFICULT as possible. Don't join this gym! Website doesn't function, no one can answer any questions, no management is EVER available. And if you are a guy, watch out for the sauna. My husband went in and a guy was masturbating in there."
655,1,"I signed up for some sort of free or minimal-cost trial they were doing for the New Year last winter, and wound up not deciding to join this gym as I joined another. Since May, or longer, I forget, I have been getting multiple calls daily by a credit collections agency on behalf of NYSC. This is impossible that I owe them money as I was never a member and, more importantly, because I simply do not owe them money! This is a form of harassment and this gym is run by crooks, and considering how many other people have shared similar (and even worse) experiences, I don't think they should be in business anymore!
They are outsourcing other companies to harass ex-members and non-members in an attempt to collect unauthorized, perhaps even fraudulent funds. It is so frustrating getting 2-6 spam calls a day, during business meetings, while I'm sleeping, etc. No wonder people hate this gym! It has a horrible reputation and for good reason. Don't join, don't even do a trial — you'll regret it. There are so many better options out there."
656,1,"NYSC Cobble Hill Brooklyn criminal business practices. I joined the gym with my boyfriend while living in Brooklyn. A high pressure personal trainer approached me and sold me for a personal training session while I was on the treadmill - and I agreed to buy a few sessions with her. She had me digitally sign what I was told was a liability waiver. I had no idea I was signing something that said I had to cancel in writing and/or that I was agreeing to anything more than a few sessions. She never let me see what I was agreeing to and assured me it was only to protect her if I got hurt. I canceled my membership with the gym and text the trainer that I was moving out of the area and wasn't going to do any more sessions. We canceled our membership in person in April. The gym has charged me for membership ever since and the trainer charged me 3 months of training sessions that I never agreed to at a gym I was no longer a member of. Almost $1000 total of charges that were not authorized. I disputed with Amex. The gym sent Amex an agreement I ""signed"" (must have been forged I never signed an agreement) that indicated I had to provide 30 days notice to cease training (I thought I just bought a few sessions!) Since I canceled in person - and they acknowledged said cancellation they used a different tactic to rob me - they played the ""oh you had to cancel in writing"" trick. The oldest criminal tactic used by gyms to steal from clients in the books. Anyone on this forum who would like to start a class action I would love to hear from you. These practices should be examined by the state attorney general's office. There are levels of fraud, forgery and deceptive business practices going on here that should be examined at a much higher level. One only needs to review yelp, the NYSC corporate complaint website, BBB, etc to see the number of victims of this company are prodigious. Some consumer advocacy around this needs to happen ASAP. NYSC is a vile, shady and conscienceless abhorrent company stealing money from the folks who can afford the least."
657,2,"On 5/09/2018, fitness training consultant Antony ** signed me up for personal training sessions at NYSC. He had me sign a keypad after explaining that the sessions would be $320/month. I had no idea my digital signature from that keypad was going to be placed onto an alleged contract that was never shown to me that day. The next month, I noticed that NYSC overcharged my account. It was for $435 instead of the $320/month that I was told. When I inquired with the personal training manager about the rate increase he was dismissive and said there was nothing he could do about the overcharge, and that I would have to contact their corporate offices.
I then called the NYSC corporate offices and they acknowledged that I was overcharged, but the representative at that number didn’t know why, and directed me to speak to Julie **, the general manager at the local gym. Right after I told Ms. about the mysterious rate increase, I was suddenly disconnected. I tried calling back, could not reach her, and she never returned my calls after that.
It seemed like I was getting a classic ""runaround"" scam. But I did contact the fitness manager once again; this time to cancel my personal training sessions entirely since no one could explain the overcharge. Mr. said he would not cancel the personal training sessions because I had allegedly signed a 90-day contract. As explained above, I never saw that contract; I only signed a keypad with no terms or contract in front of me. To my knowledge I had been simply signing up for $320/month sessions. I only became aware of the existence of the alleged contract after my attempt to cancel, when he sent it to me.
To my surprise my signature had been grafted/forged onto the contract without my knowledge using the imprint from the keypad I had signed. I was shocked that my signature was pasted all over a contract I never saw before this. At this point, it was clear he had neglected to make me aware of the alleged agreement during our initial meeting in May 2018, nor was I given a copy of the alleged agreement at that time. He was claiming I signed something that was never put in front of me when he handed me that digital keypad. So a digital image of my signature had been copy-pasted on three separate lines of an alleged agreement without my permission or knowledge on 5/09/2018.
Disgusted and frustrated by the deception, on June 14th, I told him over the phone that I would like to cancel the personal training agreement ENTIRELY and that I wanted to cancel not only the training sessions but my entire NYSC gym membership as well, due to their dishonest and deceptive tactics. He said I'd have to go to the gym in person to cancel. So that's what I did. The next day, on June 15, 2018, I went into the NYSC to make a complaint and cancel in person my membership. After canceling, I was given a receipt, which stated I had a $0 balance. I did not go back to the gym or have any additional personal training sessions after that.
Despite my efforts, during the first week of July I noticed that funds were still being taken from my account by NYSC. I was charged another $93.55 on 7/3/2018, $435 on 7/5/18, $105 on 7/9/18 and $165 on 7/15/18. Apparently NYSC was not abiding by my cancellation of personal training sessions or general gym membership. I emphatically deny any validity of their claims to contractual commitments because my signature was digitally forged onto an alleged agreement I did not see at the time. This has been a nightmarish experience and one which has put me into financial distress. I have researched online to see if other people have had similar experiences with NYSC and their digital keypad-enabled forgery, and there are numerous complaints. I request my funds be returned to my account as soon as possible. FORGERY is not acceptable or legal."
658,2,"Not only is everything continually broken and in disrepair, they erroneously mark your services as ""frozen"" when you outright CANCEL personal training services. Been trying to resolve issue for weeks now. I'm not allowed to enter other gyms because of their mess up. Manager never calls me back. Pool is now broken without a date for when that service will be restored. It's disgusting. I want my money back!"
659,1,"I went in to the gym at 41st & 3rd to cancel my membership in August of 2017. Believing all was canceled correctly, I didn't notice until May that they were still charging me monthly. While this is embarrassing on my end, it doesn't give them the right to take my money, as I correctly went in to cancel, and never visited the gym after. I was told they could see that I'd never been in after the date I stated, and that they believed my ""story"" (offensive use of wording, as it's not a story, but a factual occurrence) but it wasn't good enough.
I called the gym and was apologized to and told my membership was canceled at the moment, but that corporate dealt in refunds. I then called corporate and was told not only was my membership not canceled EITHER in August 2017 or May 2018 when I alerted them to the situation, but that each individual club does refunds. After a long while, I finally got a hold of someone at that gym who was willing to help me. Unfortunately, someone at their club didn't do their job properly, and I was never given any proper paperwork about the cancellation, even after I asked if I needed any.
I asked them to check the security footage to see me come in and cancel, but they said that wasn't good enough for validation, as there is no audio; something that is out of my control. So I asked to speak to the person I spoke with the day of cancellation, but was told he no longer works for them. Something else out of my control. I was told I couldn't get a refund without validation, but when I asked for the forms of validation they could give me, they refused.
The manager finally turned the case over to the ""higher-ups"" and nearly three weeks went by before I heard from them again; meanwhile I was calling and calling, being told the person was ""in a meeting,"" or ""not in yet."" I never heard back. I finally got ahold of them again when I found a new corporate contact, and they wanted to hear about the situation. I explained it, and they had the original manager from the club whom I had been dealing with finally call me back. He apologized for not responding, saying he thought the higher management was taking care of it. I said that didn't explain why he didn't return any of my calls. Eventually he said that they couldn't give me the full amount back, but would give me from the beginning of this year through May back in the monthly payments they'd taken from me. To me, this is still unfair, but I agreed, as frankly, I was tired of dealing with this.
He told me to reach out to Ian in corporate about scheduling my refund, but when Ian called me (after ignoring my first email) I was promptly informed I'd not be getting ANY money back. Even after I explained the situation, being thrown around, and not responded to. He offered me a discounted membership though. What an insult! That is the last thing I'd want; belonging to a gym who treats its members so terribly.
I am beyond frustrated and disappointed. In total, they took over $1,000 from me. When I called originally, I was jerked around about who could properly handle my situation, and was lied to twice about being cancelled. When I asked them to check my records of validation, they said it wasn't good enough. When I explained how I followed all proper procedures, but someone from their end didn't do their job correctly, I was told they ""felt badly"" for me. When I was told I'd get some semblance of a refund, and when I asked for it in writing, I was told this would not happen. AVOID THIS TERRIBLE GYM AT ALL COSTS. They'll take your money, no matter how correctly you follow their cancellation procedures. I am so upset. Over $1,000 down the drain because someone at their location was too lazy to do their job correctly. Despicable."
660,1,"Beware: NYSC Hoboken is a fraud & scam center. I joined for $34.99 monthly membership, they did not give me any agreement letter or receipt & kept on charging $127 on my credit card for 4 months. They never sent me any bill through e-mail or post. When I inquired at their reception, their employee had no idea for what they overcharged me. After repeated inquiry gave me visiting card of their manager Andrew, who never responded to my mails & came on phone after multiple attempts. He declined to refund any money & asked to approach my bank. On disputing transaction, bank asked them receipt & they sent bank receipt of $127, so bank did not refund overcharged amount. They looted around $500 from me. Joining this gym is most painful & torturous experience of my life. Never join this gym, they will rip-off you money not abs."
661,2,"I came in to the club in early November to make due for my past account balance (I was one month behind) and to cancel my membership. They told me there was a 45 day period before my account would be considered closed, so I would also be charged for December on the usual date. I gave them a new card which they successfully charged for the past due amount, a few days later the amount for November posted and later December was paid as agreed.
Then they kept charging me month after month afterwards. Once I became aware of this I called the gym multiple times, each time they assured me a manager would return my call and they didn't do that. I also emailed (the person who had sent out an email to me regarding my past due amount back in October) multiple times and he never responded. There were a few other email addresses associated with NYSC I had and tried them also to no avail.
I filed a dispute through my bank for all charges made after December, as well as put a block payment and later was issued a new card. They still are trying to charge me for more months in the future, fight the dispute, and threaten collection on my 'debt'. I don't know what to do. I cancelled my membership but these guys just won't stop charging me."
662,1,"I've been a member of NYSC in Livingston for a few years. When I joined, there was a promo to pay $149 upfront which locked in a lifetime monthly fee of just $20. After 2 years, however, they raised my fee to $30! When I complained, no one returned my call. I just got a credit card bill showing a $40 monthly fee! Not only is this in violation to my sign-on promo, but I wasn't even notified of an upcharge! I've heard of other members getting scammed too. Additionally, the facility has gone downhill, with much of the equipment in need of repair and maintenance."
663,3,"I signed up over a month ago as their monthly rate was really low compared to the other gyms in NYC. However, I was disappointed with the quality of service. Most of the equipment are broken and the locker rooms are pathetic. I cannot even think of walking barefeet in there. However, the event that angered me is that they pinned a late fee on me. My credit card on file got lost and had to get a replacement. Instead of the management giving me a call to suggest that my monthly payment didn't go through (common practice in most businesses), they slapped me with a late fee.
I tried calling my home gym for 3 days straight, no one seems to like answering their phones there. I then went into the gym, where the manager mentioned that they have 1000s of members and it is not possible to contact every one of them. I was like that doesn't make sense because all of their members do not undergo a similar situation that I went through. After a lot of back and forth, he agreed to waive off the late fee. However, I checked my credit statement and the late fee is on there. I am thinking of taking legal action and cancelling my membership."
664,2,"Long story short, an employee attempted to sign up a colleague as an add-on to my account. The employee was not clear about the terms and fees and then after I cancelled the application he became aggressive and cursed not once but twice (using the F-word). Puffing up and pounding his chest with his palms like a child in high-school and then running out of the gym screaming like an animal after I left and was already down the block.
After complaining to on-site management over the phone she directed me to (Paul) who after a few calls has done nothing to resolve this and moreover accused me of instigating. When I asked to speak to someone from their corporate office HR since they continue to refuse to have a discussion over email and on the record, I was directed to speak with the Market Director (Ryan). Ryan keeps insisting that we should discuss this over the phone and has not provided me with the contact information to discuss with someone else. According to Paul I should be getting a refund shortly - I am waiting for this, but he was unable to provide a reason as to why I was charged even though I never completed the application process. A terrible employee like this only exists and continues to work there because management fails to do their jobs to protect its club members. We are clearly only monthly membership fees to them."
665,1,"This is run by the worst management I have ever experienced in my life. I came into the club at beginning of December to cancel my membership. I did it at this time because I knew the annual fee was approaching and they had raised my membership once again. I called in November and was told I had to come in and cancel which I did I believe Dec 1-2. I filled out all of the paperwork and gave in my tag. Come the middle of December I get charged the annual fee which I was told I would not get charged, and also January 2nd another month charged. I called the club and the manager at the time. Was very nice and apologized and said the person I cancelled with was no longer there and this was not the first she had heard that cancellations didn't go through. She assured me she would cancel the membership and talk to corporate about refunding my money.
With this I was not confident and also gave a heads up to my bank to not let NYSC charge my debit account anymore. Come to see that FEB & March they tried to charge me again! The new manager has sent me emails and has called me every week for the last 3 months letting me know not to worry that he can confirm it is cancelled and then today I was charged another $153. I called corporate who was also useless and told 'me I had to talk to the club. I called the club and what a shock the manager didn't answer and his mailbox is full. Really! I have fees with my bank now for no charge fees along with bills that bounced today due to this. I am beyond dissatisfied and prepared to share this experience with everyone I know and all social media outlets."
666,1,"I joined the gym in Whitestone, NY for 1 year. I originally paid for an annual fee and the membership. A year later they charged my card for another annual fee without my consent. For 60 dollars plus an extra ""fixed rate"" of 50 dollars. The manager at WHITESTONE CLUB told me that my money was going to get refunded, it never happened. They are a SCAM. They love to steal money and trick you. I was never advised of a cancellation fee either. I'm greatly disappointed. DO NOT JOIN THIS GYM, UNLESS YOU WANT MONEY STOLEN FROM YOU."
667,2,"Worst Experience EVER... My experience is very bad. In the month of November 2017. I went to the NYSC of Garden City, took my best friend to check out this GYM. And they gave us a complimentary one day pass. But they asked us for the credit card anyway. When we finished, we didn’t like the GYM. the equipment was everywhere, the bathroom wasn't clean, towels everywhere. Anyways we decided not to sign up and we informed Shakira (employee at the front desk) that we did NOT want to continue with the registration. She assured us that there was no contract and that we were good to go.
This credit card I gave them, I do not usually check the monthly statements and to my surprise 2 weeks ago (3 months later) I realized that I have been charged month by month for the 2 memberships. I called Jason who is suppose to be the manager of the store and explain the situation. He confirmed that there is NO membership in the system for either of us, but still getting charged month to month. He told me to wait to fix the situation. The amounts are adding up is getting close to $300 NOW. After 1 week and a half I just called him and he has NO answer about my reimbursement. Above all, they treat you with an attitude that makes you tired and that you desist from continuing to call to ask. I will continue to bother until they explain why they charging us without being members."
668,3,"I have been a member of NYSC for about 20 years. Overall, I have been pleased with the various New York City facilities. It is always clean, I love the classes, and staff is so friendly. I have told my friends about it, and I think it’s a great gym. Recently I have taken a new job at 551 Fifth Avenue and started working at the Grand Central station location. This gym is a fire hazard. Not only it’s extremely congested with members, there is so much equipment thrown around that it's creating a tripping hazard. Moreover, there is no air at the gym. It’s like doing hot sweaty yoga. I have mentioned it to the staff members a few times, however, nothing was done.
Lastly, there are no attendants to replace weights or to ensure that the weights are returned back to their appropriate places. So you can imagine my surprise when I found out that as of February 1, 2018 this gym will become an “Elite Gym” which will require me to upgrade my membership. I immediately called the corporate office but was advised that nothing can be done! Frankly, I am appalled: I thought that after 15 years of loyalty, my membership has been “grandfathered in”. This is by no means an Elite Gym: You cannot charge members an elite price and provide substandard services. This degradation of service is unfortunate because I greatly enjoy exercising at NYSC. I wrote to the branch manager but received no response."
669,1,"A HORRIBLE UNPLEASANT experience. They only care about getting as much money out of me as possible. I was on a month to month contract, went in to cancel, the guy at the desk said ""fine all done"" and three months later the DEBT COLLECTORS start to call threatening to destroy my credit rating (!!??). It turns out buried in the paperwork is a clause saying even monthly members are liable for all charges 45 days afterwards. This included a $50 annual fee for the coming year (really? This sucks!) as well as two months in advance. They took one month off this (their ""mistake"" for double counting). The gym experience? I found it to be a bit sweaty & smelly, with lots of broken machinery."
670,2,"I wanted to explain a situation my husband and I experienced at the NYS club in East Meadow. My husband went into the club in November 2017 to cancel his membership. He was never given a form to fill out which is usually standard when canceling a membership. He asked about it and was told by the manager Kate that it was unnecessary and that she had taken care of it. I myself went into the club in December 2017 to cancel. My husband looked at his credit card statement and noticed that he was still being charged. We contacted Kate today and she completely denies meeting with my husband and basically implied that he was lying. Both my husband and I spoke to Kate today and she was beyond rude with an obnoxious attitude.
When my husband explained to her that he was extremely upset and that he was going to take it up with corporate she said to him, I don't give a.... I can't believe that someone this rude would be the face of your gym. I would like for the club to give us a refund for the months they have charged my husbands card. This is ridiculous that customers get treated this way and cursed at. It was uncalled for and unprofessional on her part. I would like something done. I called the club and asked to make an appointment with the Business Director and of course Kate said that he is very busy and she would pass my information to him. I am pretty sure she isn't going to. I am making it a point to write as many emails and make as many phone calls to corporate until someone higher up gets back to me. People should not be treated this way."
671,1,"DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS GYM! They charge you unnecessary fees at random times and do not have an explanation for them, and then they don't refund you for them! They also randomly increased the monthly dues by $10 without any notice or explanation. I went in to cancel my membership in the end of December and I asked the employee if I was going to be charged my yearly fee (which is on January 6th every year) and he clearly said NO. I was then charged my yearly fee, meaning I was lied to. I was also told by the gentleman that I was going to be charged another month's fees as part of the cancellation process, plus a $15 charge. I just found out that this isn't true either, and that it's going to be a $30 charge instead. So I went from thinking I was going to pay $45 to having to pay $100 just to cancel, even though I was told differently.
I then went in to speak with someone, and the girl there told me that she overheard the original conversation I had with the employee to cancel my account, and she remembers him telling me there will be no yearly fee and that it is only an additional $15 to cancel. She then says that she can't do anything about it even though she knows I was told the wrong information. Now for the actual gym: I hope you don't like using machines if you're interested in this gym, because they are always out of order and don't seem to get fixed for a while. The basketball is often closed for other events and clinics, so make sure you check that out. Some of the lockers are broken and don't close/open properly.
Since I signed up in 2015, this gym has done nothing to improve the experience. They have only taken things away. They don't supply towels anymore (something they did when I signed up), they don't allow a guest anymore (something they did when I signed up), they don't fix broken machines, they have just one squat rack for the entire gym, plus many more issues. This gym has done nothing but charge more and more money and take away every feature that caused me to sign up in the first place. PLEASE SIGN UP FOR A GYM ELSEWHERE!"
672,2,"I have had a membership with NYSC for a number of years and multiple times. Each time I cancelled my membership was due to rates going up over and over again without notice. The last time I signed up it was during a promotional season where it was stated that If I pay an annual fee that it would lock in my current rate or I can opt to not pay the annual fee and risk having my rate go up. So from prior experience I opted to pay the annual fee. Lo and behold 1 year later I get a notice that my rate will be going up. I contacted the manager and he said that there was nothing he could do since it came from Corporate. I emailed TSI and was given the runaround. They told me to contact the General Manager but he never responded. Even though I was paying the annual fee that ""locked in"" my rate they decided to raise it anyway. It wasn't in the contract that they could do such a thing but it also doesn't say they can't so Corporate took that chance. The membership supervisor in good faith said that he was sorry that even though they were told one thing that essentially they had to lie to all the members who signed up for that exact reason. He gave me a free month of membership for that reason. Unfortunately due to such scams and frustration by Corporate that employee decided to leave and now that Club's business is getting worse. Now I noticed that my rate jumped by 50% without any notice. I already contacted the Club and you guessed it, I'm getting the runaround. I'm bracing myself for the ensuing back and forth and the same experience everybody else has been getting about membership dues increase, balance due, cancellation issues, recurring fees despite the fact that the membership has been cancelled, and fees going to collections. Perhaps the only way to put a business with such unethical practice is by going to the Attorney General."
673,1,"I signed up with New Rochelle NYSC a few years ago. Originally I had the promotional offer of either $20 or $29 per month. I decided to go for the higher membership only because that allowed me to bring a guest, my brother. A month after sign up they advised me that that membership would no longer include a free guest. Since that was the sole reason I signed up for the higher membership I cordially and calmly asked about downgrading. I was told no. This of course seemed like a bait and switch scam. Since then I’ve had my monthly membership go up without warning, I’ve had to call numerous times to inquire about charges that I was not advised of and most recently I was a $49.95 rate lock in fee. A few which I’ve never seen before and which I never received a single email, letter or text about.
NYSC is the king of mystery charges. The last time I had to resolve an issue the rep took weeks to get back to me and then another few weeks to institute what he had promised. When I called to inquire about it I was told that I should’ve received an notice about the charge beforehand. When I said I hadn’t received a letter I was told, “Oh we do email” to which I again stated I had not received a single email from NYSC. The rep also couldn’t explain at first what the charge even was, he didn’t know. I’m totally fed up with NYSC.
I was initially excited to join NYSC but I would advise everyone to avoid it at all costs. The number of complaints and the reputation they’re developing is a sure fire way to eventual disaster. Good customer service is everything and NYSC doesn’t do good customer service. Besides the various mysterious and unexplained charges their facilities are not impressive for all the hassle and most of the good classes require an extra fee. You’re basically just paying for a pool if you’re lucky. This is all sad to say because when I first signed up I was very excited but after countless bait and switch experiences, unannounced increased fees and just horrible customer service I’m done. I warn anyone thinking of joining to please don’t! Find another gym, Equinox, 24-Hour Fitness, Planet Fitness, your local mom and pop gym, anything but this."
674,3,"In NY, they have been turning some of their clubs into ""elite"" clubs. I have a monthly plan that allows me to visit all NYSC clubs. When I looked at my statement I saw a $20 charge. After calling the club, they explained the club on 23rd is an elite club and they would charge me $20 every time I visited that club. There was no notification of kind by email or the front desk staff that I would be charged. When I asked them what was ""elite"" about this club, they literally said they didn't know. They also mentioned that they would refund the fee because they have been receiving many calls for the same reason as mine.
Hearing this, from a customer point of view, it feels like NYSC is taking money from their customers without them knowing. NYSC shouldn't have to wait for people to call for the refunds if they are receiving this many complaints They should refund ALL their customers that have been charged this extra fee for visiting an ""elite"" club and then work on communication strategy to notify their customers of their policy changes more clearly before implementing their new changes. I've been with NYSC for 7 years and this seems like a very shady process."
675,2,"I opened a membership on a month to month, no obligation membership for 74.99 a month, I was charged $94.99 after all the taxes and I was not even going to the gym. I canceled my membership in August 7th. I was directed to a website called Cancelwizard.com that charged me $35 to cancel. Then I Called NYSC to make sure that it was canceled, and they tell me that there is a 45-day cancellation notices, so I was still getting charged $56 for October plus an additional $10 cancellation fee. This is nightmare. I will never again go to an NYSC ever again."
676,2,"I signed up for NYSC Avenue A membership in June 2016 during a special. My contract indicates $39.99 will come out the first of every month, and my contract also reflected a one-time membership fee. Fast forward to July 2017. I see a $59.99 charge through my bank from NYSC. I called indicating the error, the customer service rep said per my contract, I must pay an annual $59.99. I had him refer to my contract wherein he found no such language authorizing NYSC to debit $59.99 from my account. The money was put back in my account. Fast forward to August 2017. I decided I would move my membership over to Blink since they have better reviews, and you get more for money, and my friends go there. Per my contract, after the one year which ended in June 2017, the contract defaulted to month-to-month, and cancellation per the terms must be 30 days.
On 8/25, I called the membership line and they instructed me to go to the club. I went into the NYSC club on this day on 51st & Lex, the woman working indicated only the general manager could process cancellation, she scanned my tag, and said nothing further was needed. Based on the language of the contract, I decided to do a follow-up call. An hour or so later on 8/25, I called to confirm submission of my cancellation request. The customer service rep indicated there was no evidence of me going in a club, and then she said I must do this with a general manager. I was clearly frustrated, especially because I have a planned trip, and want my cancellation in before 30 days is up to avoid getting an Oct 1 $39.99 fee.
The woman also told me I could only go into my home club which is Avenue A to cancel. I told her there was no language on the contract regarding same, and the exact sentence on their website when you sign into your account, under cancellation it states ""members may initiate the cancellation in person at any club location"", she was still arguing with me that I was going about this incorrectly without any evidence on her part. I was then told to head to Avenue A and ask for the general manager, Joelle as she is working on Saturday 8/26. I went into the club, and Joelle was not there, and I was told I was the second person that came in asking for her. The girls at the counter were unable to assist me, because, again, only the general manager can handle cancellations.
Today, August 28, I called Avenue A to see if Joelle was in, and I was now told that I must make an appointment with her to cancel my request - this was never told to me, and further, she was not available to meet today (8/28). Given that I'm leaving out of town, and I do not come back until after Labor Day, this would give Avenue A another month of my fees, and they will be charging me $39.99. After calling my bank, and giving them the rundown, I was advised to file a claim. Now my bank is handling this.
I am extremely disturbed by this cancellation policy. With that being said, it appears said policy is geared around inconvenience as a tactic to continue taking membership fees, as well as breaching their own contract by debiting $59.99 annual fee from me, which on my contract says ""Annual Fee: $ 0"". Lastly, NYSC renewed my contract with them, without consent, no evidence, no signature, no recorded conversation indicating I agreed to same and construed my conversation of asking for my $59.99 back as a renewal. I have been documenting every call and visit with NYSC and am hopeful my bank will determine their tactics as a theft threat."
677,1,"Ordered a ping pong table for my youngest son and it isn't available to be delivered so I said pick up in store... chose a store with stock only to get an email that my order was cancelled because they don't have any. They suggested I waited until the next flash sale and I told them even when you look online no stores in my area have any tables, so it makes no difference. Why do you put big items on sale that are not available to everyone. I dislike Dick's. Overpriced and never helpful in the stores either. I hope Amazon shuts them down."
678,2,"I purchased a GT Aggressor Pro bike at Dick’s on July 4th 2017. Along with the bike I purchased the warranty maintenance plan suggested by the associate; a 2 year warranty plan that cost me $46.99+tax. I purchased this bike at Sycamore Commons 10530 Ne Parkway, Suite J - Matthews, NC 28105, not sure about store number.
Beginning July this year I took the bike back to the same store for tune up included with warranty plan and general check up. Left the bike at store on a Sunday, and on Tuesday called me letting me know the bike needed parts replaced that were included in warranty plan. He also told me that he was going on vacation for a week and that he would order the parts before leaving. I was able to pick up my bike so I could ride it while he went on vacation. A week later I took the bike back for repair (Sunday) and waited to hear from...
Two weeks went by, and I never heard from so I called to find out that the bike had not been touched, and it was just hanging from the ceiling. Meanwhile, I hadn’t been able to ride my bike for over 2 weeks. When I asked why such a delay in repairing the bike I was informed that only works one night per week (Tuesday), and he has to fix the bikes but also assemble bikes for the store. I was extremely upset that when I bought the warranty/maintenance suggested plan no one mentioned that there is only one technician that works only one night per week. I find that inadmissible for a company as big as Dick’s.
I went to pick up my bike that day with nothing repaired, and spoke to and the store manager that told me I could have gone to another store where they have more technicians. I bought my bike at that store, I purchased the warranty/maintenance plan at that store, and I live in the neighborhood, I didn’t think I had to go to another store for fast service (that was a first I heard of it). Also guaranteed me that he was waiting on the parts for the bike but until I called that day there was no communication. If there had been communication I could have picked up my bike and ride it until the parts came in.
So basically I purchased a maintenance plan that I did not use, I have now this bike for sale, and I will never enter a Dick’s store in my life again. Also, every time I went to that store I had to request for someone to come to the Bikes department, and it was always from Guns department that had to come. I believe investing in more labor would be helpful to customers."
679,1,"I was shopping at the Dick's Sporting Goods in the Dayton Mall over the weekend. It is my son's first year playing football and we went out to get all of his stuff. I purchased his cleats a football a pair of socks a cap a pair of football gloves a water bottle among other things. The next day I am getting the bags ready for my son to go to football and realize the gloves are not in there. I call the store and let them know that one of the items I purchased was not there. I was told by management that they would review the tapes and give me a call back to let me know if my statement was true. I have worked in retail management almost 20 years, I have never even thought about telling a customer that I would review the tapes because I do not believe them when they did not receive an item.
When a customer takes time out of their day to call about something that was left there, the customer should be apologized to for the mistake that the store has caused. They should apologize for the fact that that customer has to come back up to the store to receive their merchandise. There should be no mention of having to review a security tape to see if the customer is lying. I felt like they were telling me I was lying and trying to steal from this company. If this was only a five or $10 item I would just go buy another one but these were a $25 pair of football gloves. I have never had a worst customer experience in my life.
I will be sure to tell every person I encounter and everybody in the entire School District to not go to Dick's for their sporting needs. I will definitely not be returning for the next 8 years that my son is in School playing sports. This shows that this company does not value their customers or their experiences within the store. The way to build a company and create a positive Revenue over last years is by building customer relations. When you have a bad experience in a store you tell everyone, when you have a good experience in the store you might tell a few people. It looks like the majority of the stores reviews are definitely not satisfactory."
680,2,"This is the second time I've had problems with Dick's Sporting Goods. This past order was by far the worst response from Dick's Sporting Goods. My husband ordered a Bauer Hockey Shield for my son who plays hockey, this was his gift for doing well in school. So he ordered the shield and it finally came today! Well the shield was supposed to come with a hockey helmet bag, and mounting screws for the old helmet and new shield. Guess what didn't come??? The hockey bag and the mounting equipment! I emailed customer service, and nothing in return. The customer service emailed me back their response was basically either return at the store for a full refund which was over 60.00 or send back the shield and, ""We will send out another after that has gotten back to us."" The shield was ordered online because their store didn't have it. I will never spend any more money online for Dick's or in the store."
681,2,My most recent order online was terrible and I am done doing business with Dick's because of that experience. I used both the chat and phone number for customer service but nobody helped me. No one would answer my question or give me any solutions. When I placed my order and printed my receipt it said it would be one price but then a minute later I got an email with a completely different higher price. That is completely shady and misleading. No one answered why that happened or why my card is being charged for way more than what their website and receipt originally said. I would've canceled but no one was helpful and now I will return just on the principle of not supporting shady businesses.
682,1,"I ordered two jerseys online and selected IN STORE pickup. However, when I arrived at the store to pick up the jerseys, the store only gave me one jersey and said the other one had been shipped to me and wouldn't arrive until 10 days out. I needed it for a sports event that night which is the reason I ordered two jerseys in the first place and selected IN STORE pickup--one for each of my sons.
Instead of cancelling the shipment of the second jersey and giving me the jersey that I'd ordered online (which they had in stock) they told me I could purchase ANOTHER jersey and then when the jersey I'd ordered came in the mail, I could come in and get a refund for it. So essentially they wanted me to pay for 3 jerseys so that I could leave the store with 2. I called customer service for their help and was told the same thing. I literally made the online order 45 minutes before arriving at the store to pick it up. There is NO WAY the other jersey had already shipped in 45 minutes. I will take my business back to Academy from now on where they actually care about their customers. I can see that your store is called DICK'S for a very good reason."
683,1,"DICK'S business practices are seriously flawed. As a customer, I have been treated very, very poorly. Let me explain what has happened up to this point. On April 12 I placed an order for a set of golf clubs. I received a delivery date of 4/18. My wife stayed home on 4/18 to accept the delivery. The clubs did not arrive on 4/18. Over the course of 4/18 and the following two days at no time did I receive a call, email or text message from DICK'S to inform me of the status of my clubs. Concerned and pressed for time because of an upcoming golf trip I had to call your customer service department to get an order status. I was informed that the clubs were lost! And when I say lost, I mean a DICK'S customer service rep told me that they had no idea where the clubs were.
At this point the DICK'S customer service rep presented me with two options - cancel the order outright or cancel the order and place another ""2nd"" order. I asked that a 2nd order for the clubs be placed. The customer service rep then told me she was going to place a 2nd order. At which point I thought that the order was placed...however... I checked my email on 4/21 and saw that the 1st order was canceled but I saw no information that a 2nd order had been placed. This seemed suspicious, so I once again called customer service. I was informed by the representative that the 2nd order was never placed. I was a bit annoyed but since I still wanted the clubs I worked with the representative and placed the 2nd order. She discounted the clubs as compensation and I received a delivery date of 4/28. I thought everything was finally straightened out however...
4/28 came and went and no clubs. On 4/30 I checked my tracking order to check on the status of the order. I discovered the order was canceled! Confused, at 11 AM I placed another call to customer service to find out why the order was canceled. The customer service rep told me that the order was canceled due to the item being out of stock. I couldn't believe it. Infuriated and frantic because of my upcoming golf trip, I asked that I speak with a manager and I was forwarded to a call center supervisor. She told me she was sorry and I think she expected me to be satisfied with a simple ""we're sorry"".
I explained to her that as a customer I need to be compensated for my trouble by finding the exact clubs or clubs that are similar to the clubs that I purchased in one of the DICK'S stores for me to pick up (I do not trust their courier service). She then forwarded me to some DICK'S store clerk in Freehold and dropped off the call. She actually dumped me on some guy who works in the store and bailed. Incredible! This store guy was apologetic and tried to help but did not have the clubs in stock and was not authorized to make me an offer for another set...so...
This store guy told me my only recourse is to call customer service...again!!! So this time my wife called customer service. She had to once again explain the history behind this debacle to someone else. In fact, it is now 2 PM and she is still on the phone with customer service. Another thing worth mentioning, DICK'S customer service rep actually questioned if the 1st order was really lost, basically calling me a liar. So not only did DICK'S waste my time, not only did they lose an item that I had purchased and then didn't have the decency to contact me and tell me that they lost it, not only did they sell me the same item for the 2nd time and not actually have the item in stock and not have the decency to contact me to tell me, but one of their reps actually questioned my credibility? I'm stunned that a retail company would treat a customer this poorly.
So as of 2 PM, this matter has not been resolved. I am now being told by the rep that the only compensation that DICK'S will offer is points on some reward program or an offer to buy more expensive clubs. This is absolutely ridiculous. In fact, it seems that the initial discounted offer on the clubs was some sort of scam to lure me into buying more expensive clubs. However, I am completely resolved to escalate this matter as far up the chain as possible and to use social media as a way to explain to potential customers that they treat customers like garbage. They've wasted my time and aggravated me to no end."
684,2,Ordered an incline trainer online. When it came in the electrical system was not working. Took them over three weeks to come get the equipment and it sat in my living room and pieces for over a week. Then I had to rent a truck and build a second one to replace the first one. And now it’s taking over a month to get my refund back for the first one. I will never deal with them again.
685,1,"DICK’S SPORTING GOODS – A pitiful online order, delivery and return system. What a nightmare! I am an experienced online shopper with a Master's Degree in Business, used to efficient, effective service from many online retailers such as Amazon. So I expected more of the same – but not from Dick’s who I tried once and will not use again! Poor delivery – poor return system – poor customer service department – poor accounting! And I am out $18.11!
Here’s What Happened: On March 16/2018, with the assistance of a salesperson from the Brownsville Texas Dick’s store, I placed an online order for a pair of golf shoes that they were out of stock in the store. He assured me that there would be no delivery charge, and that if they didn’t fit, I could return them without shipping charges. On March 26th, the shoes arrived three days AFTER the promised delivery date. I returned the shoes the next day because they did not fit, following the instructions in the package (I was surprised because they did not provide a return UPS sticker) and was charged $18.11 at our local UPS store!
As I was due to leave Texas the next day, I did not quibble over the charge but complained. (I have the receipt for the UPS charge.) I wrote an email to Customer service complaining about the UPS charge when shipping was supposed to be free. I got NO response. I have been awaiting a credit to my ISA account since then. It is now April 16th – one month after this process started and I still don’t have my money back for the shoes.
I called Dick’s customer service today. The agent I spoke with was very nice but could do nothing. She had no record of my email complaint. She didn’t know why the shoes were late. She didn’t know why they didn’t include a UPS return label in the box. She said I could have taken the shoes back to a Dick’s store, but the nearest Dick’s store is a 50-minute drive away (until the McAllen store opens). She said that my account had been credited on April 13th but that it would take three to five business days to clear. That means it could take up to April 20th, if the system is reliable, which I now doubt. I hope that the call “was recorded”.
So: 1. Dick's has had my money since March 26th. 2. The delivery was late. 3. It cost me an additional $18.11 and my time to return the shoes. 4. No-one at Customer Service responded to my email and they have no record of receiving it. 5. After all of this rotten experience, I am still waiting for my $151.54 credit to my VISA. I will not use Dick’s again. I will not recommend it to any of my friends or colleagues."
686,3,"I'm writing to share a recent experience at the Augusta Mall location, in Augusta, Georgia; wherein, I and my companions, were verbally assaulted, by a sales associate. On Sunday, April 8, 2018, my companion, son, and his companion, arrive at Dick's Sporting Goods, Augusta Mall location. I inquired with the young lady behind the service desk/register, the location of the inversion tables. She did not necessarily answer but instead looked hesitantly at the other cashier when she bopped up, and explained that they have to use locks so we wouldn't be able to actually hang. I said, ""Thank you, I understood,"" and asked again, where they were located. She finally pointed, and, off we went to look.
We arrive at the section where three inversion table models are displayed. My group is looking them over when a male sales associate, in a light purple shirt, comes out from the back, and asks if we need any help. I looked at him, and said, ""We are definitely buying an inversion table. At the moment, we are deciding which model, so at this moment, I do not believe we need help but when we make our decision, just be around then so you can pull it, and we can get on out of here."" He nodded his head, agreed with me, laughed, and said, ""Let me know if you have any questions.""
In hindsight, this where I should have asked, ""Which models do you have in stock?"" But, I didn't because, well, gosh darn, Dick's is a pretty major retail store. I honestly didn't think that stock would be an issue. And, at this point, begs the question, why didn't the sales associate actually do his job and go check which were in stock for the customer to purchase when the customer flat out told him exactly what they were looking for upon initial contact? To continue with the story, we spend ten, fifteen minutes discussing, and we decide we wanted the more expensive Teeter model, for $399 and change. We look around to locate the sales associate, he's nowhere to be found. We search, we ask, we ask, we search. At this point, no one is helping us.
Finally, he bops back around, I smile and tell him the model we've decided upon, joking that they've selected the most expensive. He walks over to it, looks at the tag, looks back at me and says, ""Let me check to see if we have it in stock."" I looked at him, and said okay. Admittedly, a bit irritated that he didn't take the time before to look what he had in stock, if there was a possibility of a stock issue. He takes leave, we wait, and wait. The sales associate comes back, and informs us that he doesn't have two of the three models in stock. TWO of the three models NOT in stock. I then ask my one and only, very reasonable question, ""When will you have them in stock?"" His answer was, ""I don't know."" And, said it, with a very lackadaisical, mocking, laughing tone in his voice. At that point, ""I turned and said, ""Well, you're useless."" And, walked to the front of the store.
Having trained in customer service for over 30 years (Fortune 100), the one answer that is overwhelmingly unacceptable in any given sales opportunity, is the response, ""I don't know."" It is an absolutely inappropriate response. His response should have been, ""Let me check"", but it wasn't. For me, that sales associate had become useless. I was there to purchase an inversion table, and HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HELP ME, was unable OR UNWILLING to answer my ONE question.
As I was walking out, I stopped at the register of the only associate that appeared to know anything, the same one that directed us to the inversion table display area, and explained to her what had just happened. The male sales associate literally CHASES me down, and starts yelling at me! Screaming at me, shouting over me and the other female sales associate, ""I asked you if you had any questions. You should have asked me your questions when I asked you if you had any?"" SCREAMING at me, physically posturing his body, raising his hands over his head YELLING, and conducting himself in a HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE AND UNCALLED FOR MANNER, ""Have a blessed day."" No less than a dozen times. Literally, shouting me down, my companions down, over talking the poor little female sales associate.
He became UNGLUED, PHYSICALLY AND VERBALLY AGGRESSIVE with a female customer, and your other female employees. It was the worst display of misogynistic, religiosity driven behavior I've ever witnessed. So, this sales associates, instead of doing his job, treats a customer who has made it clear that they are buying, no actual sales skills needed, just the stock to actually purchase an item ends up getting chased out of the store by a screaming sales associate??? I called the store yesterday, Monday, April 9th, early morning, and did speak with a young man that identified himself as Corey. Considering how upset I was when I spoke with him, he handled himself quite well. He took my name and number, said he would conduct an investigation, get with his personnel director.
I explained to him, in no uncertain terms, that I feel that this male associate needs to be dismissed. He said he would get back to me, and believe he did, but I didn't answer. I've chosen to deal with this matter going forward, in written form. I also decided to not send this communication until today so that I could calm down, attempt to see the situation from all points of view, and I keep coming back to we were mistreated, BADLY, by your sales associate, and something needs to be done, so I will speak up, out, and against this sales associate."
687,2,"I placed an order for cleats and a softball glove last Tuesday. At that time I was charged for the amount owed. Two days later I am again charged for one of the items that was shipped. Resulting in an overdraft in my checking account. I called Customer Service and before I could even speak to someone the voice message was already explaining that they authorize the card when the ordered is placed and they again charge it when the order is shipped. Nowhere on the website did I see that they would do this, only after the fact. I did not authorize them to charge my account twice, even though one is an ""authorization"". I was not happy so I was given a reference number and was told I would be getting an email in 24 hrs. This was Thursday, it is now Monday! I am beyond frustrated and disappointed in the customer service with Dick's and will no longer be shopping with this company."
688,1,"I went in yesterday (YORK PA) and purchased a pair of tennis shoes for my son. I asked about military discounts and without hesitation, the young man entered a code for the ""heroes"" discount. Today, I went to purchase volleyball shoes for my daughter. When I asked for the discount and showed my ID, the girl radioed to ask about it. Someone told her they don't have one. I informed them, I received it just the day before. They would not give me the discount. I called the corporate office and was on hold for 10 minutes before customer personnel got on the phone, telling me they don't have the discount. I asked to speak to a manager and was on hold another ten minutes. Finally, my call was transferred to which no one would answer for ten minutes. I hung up the phone. I will NEVER shop at a Dick's Sporting Goods store again. All this in light of them getting political!! Must be run by liberals who don't give a ** about anything but your money!"
689,1,"I am disappointed with the decision by Dick's to stop selling AR style rifles. I thought Dick's was a company that was knowledgeable about firearms and supported the 2nd amendment. This decision shows me that neither belief is true. I thought Dick's knew that the things that make an AR an ""assault rifle' are purely cosmetic and they don't fire faster than any semi-automatic that you sell. The push to ban ""Assault Rifles"" is just part of the left's plan to eventually ban all firearms and Dick's has for whatever reason joined them. I do not in any way support companies that do not strongly support my 2nd amendment rights and I will never again buy from Dick's and will encourage other like-minded sportsmen to do the same."
690,2,"As an avid sports family, we shop at Dick's Sporting Goods frequently - among the sports my family enjoy is Sporting Clays. However, your company has chosen to stop selling to my young adult athletes the #1 necessary equipment needed for our family sport - shotguns. Who is Dick's to choose what sports my children choose to compete in and purchase the necessary equipment for. We have in the past purchased several shotguns and numerous other sports equipment from Dick's... This ends today I'm sorry to say. I know we are just one family & this will probably have little effect on a large company's bottom line, however this is really our only recourse for a family that is having a so called sporting goods store dictate what sports are appropriate for young athletes to play."
691,1,"Got a card from Dick's Sporting Goods just to get a bonus deal on Black Friday. We made first payment on card over automated phone system and received confirmation number. Got late notice and so called them. Their own automated system said we had made the payment and also had zero balance. Waited forever to talk to a live person, then was told that the bank transfer did not get applied in their system for some reason. But still left us with a late payment notice on credit. Paying off card then canceling. Beware of this company and stores that issue cards using this bank. We were loyal Dick's customers but will not shop there again."
692,2,"I ordered a pair of Oakley sunglasses the 2nd of this month with availability status on them to be in stock and delivered on the 12th. This whole time my sunglasses have been in process and not shipped. Payment has been confirmed but no tracking even created. Dick's Sporting Goods have a customer service 800 number but it is all automated and there is no menu key to talk to a live person... (go figure). Finally today I broke down and messaged an actual representative on Dick's website and they are going to ""investigate the shipping problem"" but will need up to 48 hours to hear back via email. NOT HAPPY! CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND NO GIVEN BY THE COMPANY WHEN I TOLD THEM I'D LIKE TO LEAVE AN UNFAVORABLE REVIEW!!!"
693,2,"I purchased a coat from Dick's online on 1/2/18. I received a sale email from Dick's on 1/31/18 and the same coat was now on sale for 40% off. I called customer service the next day and the rep said she would have to transfer me to a supervisor. After being on hold for more than 20 minutes, the rep came back and told me the supervisor said she could not give me the sale price, but she could have if it had only been a couple of days since my purchase. Never got to talk to the supervisor. This doesn't make sense because there is a Dick's store near me and I can return (60 day return policy) the coat and then purchase a new one online for the sale price. Poor policy and I will never shop Dick's again."
694,2,"I returned a pair of pricey Nike sweats (too big) purchased for my daughter as a Christmas gift. This was ordered online from Dick's (we do not have a store near us), and I used the return UPS slip included in the original packing along with the Dick's proper return code form. I see per UPS that Dick's return facility accepted my return package on 1/12/18 with a man named William.
As of today 1/26/18 still no credit back to my Visa. I spoke with a customer service rep on 1/24/18. She explained there was nothing she could do to help. She further went on to tell me she had to put in a request for a person in the return department to 'look into it'. I offered the UPS tracking confirmation info that states my return was received by Dick's. Tasha at customer service says again there is nothing she can do, and I will be contacted by phone or email in 3 to 5 days. Is this 2004? This should be Dick's problem, not the customer's that follow return policy. I have ordered from Dick's a few times in the past. However, they have lost me as a customer at this point. Too much of a hassle."
695,1,"On December 17th I ordered a Christmas gift online from Dick's Sporting Goods. I paid $89 with shipping and handling. When I received the item I opened it up to wrap it in the Christmas wrapping paper and I saw both men's long wear had PLASTIC SECURITY TAGS! I wanted to remove the tag, but it broke and inside of that tag was SHARP, LIKE RAZOR GLASSES with an unknown liquid inside, instantly I was bleeding and that liquid mixed into my blood!
I called the Company and I told them that ""WHO SENDS AT CHRISTMAS TIME CLOTHING WITH SECURITY TAGS?"", they said, ""You could it take to the store and they can take it off!"" I replied that If I had time for the stores and shopping, I wouldn't have shopped online! I asked them what kind of liquid was inside the plastic tag? I CUT my hand and the liquid burst into the blood, They said they don't know what chemicals it contains, they don't know even what liquid it is! Is anyone checking employments IQ's before hiring? Maybe they don't do that test on purpose! If they were given IQ tests they WON'T HAVE ANY EMPLOYEES, there. One month went by and I didn't get refund FULL price either."
696,2,"After just over 2 years of service, my rates have increased 3 times, to the tune of over 40%. The channel selection has only decreased, the reliability remains the same, and as such the rate increases are unjustified. The functionality of the service is good, and well thought out, but the increases are unreasonable. I was a ""cord-cutter"" a few years ago, but even those rates didn't go up this fast. I will be looking at alternatives."
697,1,We did the free trial and cancelled the trial on the day we were suppose to. They billed us $44.99 and said we did not cancel in time. They said it was an hour late (which I know it wasn't). We called as soon as we saw the charge on our credit card (we had to try 5 different times because wait times were over an hour each time... another huge red flag). They said it was over a week since purchase and we couldn't cancel. We didn't even know about the charge until we got our credit card statement. At that point it was almost a month later. Steven at customer service was awful and said no one at their facility has the ability to refund money to people. I have never written a bad review... ever. I want to protect people from this company. They are awful!!! Do not use their service.
698,2,"PlayStation Vue has become a complete rip off since their update. It automatically starts streaming a show that live, 80% of the time I'm a few minutes into a show and get the http or bitrate error. As of now, I've been on hold for customer support for one hour, 20 minutes and counting. If I'm watching a show and want to see something else, I literally have to back out 7, 8, 9 times before I can get back to My Shows. Shows that I've set up to record, don't. I could care less about the guide, it doesn't suffice for everything that’s gone wrong since the update. Oh, did I mention that the descriptions are in such a small font that you can't read anything without. I can't believe such a large corporation doesn't fix, nor care about their customers problems. Plus, I have never heard of a worldwide company that has absolutely no customer service on the weekend. Not that they will ever answer. I'm going back to Sling TV."
699,2,"If you're into movies TV shows, you can't beat cutting the cord with PlayStation... BUT, if you want to watch sports, and you pause or delay watching, after it has started, PSV is an unmitigated disaster!!! It's bad enough that it has gaffed some of the basketball games I like to watch, where 1/2 way thru it jumps to the end. Or, won't let you watch it until it's done, which the next day, I likely hear the score before having the opportunity to watch the game, and, I wanted to watch it that night anyway! Yesterday we started watching the Super Bowl a few minutes late and paused a couple of times and the last 2 minutes of the game got cut out and it jumped to the post game interviews.
Even when I looked away and tried to start the game over and hope to see the last couple minutes, it would only rewind to the point of the post game interview... as thought the game wasn't recorded. It's all there today. Completely and totally unacceptable and a HUGE fail for your service. It doesn't matter how much less you cost, if you can't provide the service you claim you can. The value is ZERO!"
700,3,"I ordered a custom Giants tee shirt, with my husband name and number and the lettering and the numbering on the tee shirt is way too big. The lettering and number is not the same ratio as the picture and is so huge that you can see it three blocks away. This is not what a Pro-line tee shirt looks like... It seems as though they were trying to fill the order so fast that they used any iron lettering. My husband is a die-hard Giants fan and I cannot give him this shirt. I wrote to the company for another shirt with proper lettering, even though it's a no return policy and waiting to hear back. They should be ashame to put this lettering on any sports attire... The Giants would be up set and so am I."
701,2,"How on earth does a company based in Florida take over one week to get a shipment to Philadelphia and Amazon can get me merchandise from the same State in two days flat? Not sure what the issue is but a big company like this needs to step their game up, terrible shipping times, glad I got clothing two weeks before a birthday or it would have been late for sure. TERRIBLE SHIPPING."
702,2,"When I ordered a custom jersey for my 4-year-old's birthday, it did not deliver twice. I live in a house on a street and it stated it was undeliverable. When speaking with customer service they said they could not contact them as they had no information, that blows my mind considering you are dealing with this shipping company. How do you not have any contact information or know where their carrier guns are. Landmark Global is also... No way to get a hold of anyone to figure out how to get your package. This does not make any sense to me. This website and courier I don’t trust. Will never order anything from them again."
703,1,Customer service is a joke. You spend several minutes on hold just for them to tell you they aren't allowed to help you with anything custom ordered. Worst customer service ever. Don't waste your money ordering anything custom from them!
704,1,"I ordered some jerseys but my bank rejected the payment so I did some research. I found that this company has a lot of dissatisfied customers who have been mislead. The first red flag was when they tried to charge me for more money than what was listed on the checkout page. I went to their FAQ area and read this: ""11. Why do you charge my card more than your product price?"" ""We only receive the product price. The extra money may be charged by the blank as the blank fee. Hope you can understand."" NOTICE THE WRONG SPELLING OF BANK? This is a RED FLAG that this company is most likely from another country and might be a scam where you don't get what you see or ordered. If you get your order. Thank goodness for my bank! I suggest you stay far away from this place."
705,2,"I ordered an Eagles Super Bowl Champions polo right after they won the Super Bowl. The shirt I ordered was nearly all black and stated that the graphics would be embroidered on the shirt. Since I placed the order, the image of the shirt changed to black with gray sleeves. I didn't check the description at the time but received my shirt today and found out the item description also changed from embroidered graphics to heat sealed graphics. I paid $60 for a black shirt with embroidered graphics and received a black and grey shirt with heat sealed graphics.
I have since spoken with their customer service department several times and they are beyond useless. When explaining what was going on, the customer service agent said they would normally offer a replacement but the item is currently out of stock. She didn't seem to grasp the fact that the item description completely changed since I ordered the item and therefore a replacement was pointless because I would once again receive an incorrect item. She then said she'd waive the return fee which was obvious since they screwed it up.
However, after waiting about 3 weeks on a special event item. I can no longer find the item I originally ordered since everything is out of stock everywhere. So I had to settle for an incorrect shirt with a slight discount just so I could have something from the Super Bowl win. Overall, terrible and completely useless customer service. They could not provide me a reason for the complete change of the item I ordered. I also noticed the item number listed in their order confirmation and the PayPal transaction did not match up. I will NEVER again order from them."
706,1,"So, I ordered a custom Saints sweatshirt for my boyfriend's birthday... The patch completely peeled off the first time he wore it! So embarrassing. They had a fancy iron on made but didn't bother to iron it on. Worth a crap when they should have sewn it in the first place... considering it took extra processing days. When I contacted them about it they told me (after I read that it was non-returnable due to custom nature) that they could return it but not offer me a refund. I told her I didn't want another one sent just to have this happen again. I just wanted a refund... My boyfriend liked the design & we can get it sewn on but the point is this whole thing was unnecessary; especially for the price.
They offered me a $15 refund for a $75 item... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! That didn't even cover my original cost of shipping. When I asked her why they couldn't at least offer half of the cost of the item like most places she said she was sorry but that was the best she could do. Talk about pissed. Never again ordering from here... I hope my review helps some of you guys avoid issues!"
707,2,"I used NFL Shop for the FIRST time on Feb. 3rd (and it will be the last!). I placed an order, apparently this was a ""Special Event item' scheduled to be shipped LAST Wed. 2/7, it didn't. As of 2/15, the order is still showing as ""New."" (Normal orders show as New when you first place them, then ""Processing,"" then ""Shipped"") I have contacted Customer Service 4 times so far, 2 times via live chat, 2 times via phone and the customer service reps are clueless useless fools. Sorry to be so harsh but that's what it is.
What absolutely irks me is my card was immediately charged early morning Sun. Feb 4th - so they already have my money! The live chat I had on Tuesday morning, the responses to my questions were extremely slow, 1-2 minutes from my question to a template based answer that resolved nothing at all - and of course like any website, phone call you make, these companies want to to take a customer satisfaction survey. If I get decent customer service and a big issue is resolved, yeah I have no problem letting them know the rep was very helpful. If it's poor... sorry, not wasting my time unless they are going to give me something in return. These never improve service anyway.
My LATEST phone call about my order again, this morning. This woman, who sounded like she was eating an early lunch as she was talking softly lets me know ""your order is scheduled to ship February 7th"" - Seriously? I was floored, I immediately kind of snickered in disbelief and told her, ""ok, can you tell me what today's date is?"" There was a brief pause, then she said ""Feb 15."" Then puts me on hold to 'look into it' (yeah, sure.) Comes back and tells me it will ship today, you get an email with a tracking number (yes I know that!). Then tells me the warehouse is behind schedule. 8 days behind schedule? I realize the Super Bowl, Playoffs. Christmas are probably the most hectic times for them. But again, 8 days behind?
As for MY inconvenience I wanted free upgrade shipping since I explained - again - that they already charged my card, the info you just gave me about my item will be shipped 8 days... in the past. But no, she mumbled again, refused to upgrade. So do I think my item will ship today... no. If it does I'll be stunned. I plan to call again in a few hours to maybe get someone with a brain cell, and get a straight answer, no I won't deal with the useless ""Live Chat"" on the site again. Perhaps I'll get lucky. If this was some 10-15 dollar order, I wouldn't be AS ticked off, that doesn't matter though. This is just junk service! I just only wish this item was available in nearby stores in my area, it's not and that's why I chose this site. In fact the item I bought is sold out on every site I've checked! I will never order from NFL Shop again!"
708,2,"When the Eagles won the Super Bowl I ordered the T-Shirt, the beanie, and the towels. I never received confirmation that the order went through but the money was out of my account. The website said “Ships before 2/12”. I just received the shirt but there was no beanie or towels and when I asked they said it would ship in another 3 days. Almost two weeks after I placed the order. I could have driven to Philadelphia and bought my stuff there and got it faster. When I talked to customer service they never claimed fault and when I complained about when it was supposed to ship they said “Is there anything else I can help you with?” I may never shop through them again."
709,2,"Ordered a championship t-shirt night of the Eagles Super Bowl. NFL.com claimed free shipping with Shop Runner. That did not happen and they charged for shipping. The t-shirt is 12 days out; they claim it is special order but I saw thousands of fans wearing the t-shirt at the parade. So I guess once they get your money, you go to the bottom of the pile. NEVER AGAIN!"
710,1,"I ordered a Superbowl LII t-shirt and an Eagles Superbowl jersey 2 weeks ago. Both items were listed as in stock with 4-5 day delivery, plenty of time before the game. 2 weeks later and 2 days after the game I'm still waiting on the package. I called customer support 2x the week before the game to cancel the order but was promised it would arrive before the game. They said customer service received a ""memo"" that all orders would arrive before the game as promised. This was a lie, I'm sure they screwed a lot of people with false shipping promises and were banking on customers keeping the items regardless of them arriving after the season had ended. I will be returning the package as soon as it arrives and will never order from NFLShop.com or Fanatics again. I advise everyone to avoid."
711,1,"I am a die hard Philadelphia Eagles fan, and was very excited to see that they were going to the Super Bowl this season. I wanted to buy some fan gear for the game, so I had decided to order from an online site. I chose NFL Shop, because of the name (had never used them before). I placed my order for a Special Event Jay Ajayi game jersey and a conference championship shirt on 26 January with expedited shipping. I received a confirmation email that stated that I would receive my items by 3 February, the day before the Super Bowl game. Well, I didn't receive my items before the game and was totally devastated since the Eagle had won the game. A few days later, I received an email stating that my shirt was shipped, but the jersey was delayed. I didn't receive my first item via expedited shipping, so I contacted customer service and they refunded my shipping fee/gave me a partial refund on my jersey and told me that I would receive my jersey 10 February.
Got an email on 6 February that my jersey is yet delayed again with no confirmation of a delivery date this time. I am totally infuriated at this point!!! I called customer service again, and I demanded to know the reason that the jersey that I had purchased has been delayed for a third time. This time I was told that my jersey would ship by 16 February. I exploded! I told the agent that I was going to order the same jersey from another service to prove that they could beat this last promised delivery date from NFL Shop (even with the expedited shipping that I had originally purchased), then I will call NFL Shop back to cancel my jersey order with a refund of my remaining balance, as well as finding an avenue to leave the worst review that I could possibly give.
I also told the customer service agent that it's apparent that NFL Shop would have as many so called issues as they are having when the Eagles win their very first and only Super Bowl, but I bet that never happens when customers/fans purchase Patriots gear. LMAO, then she gave me another partial refund on the jersey. NFL Shop is such a fake, and a joke, and I can assure everyone out there that I will never be using their lack of services again. Please don't fall into the same trap that I did."
712,1,"Ordered an Eagles jersey on January 25, next to the jersey it said Special Event item, would ship before January 31. January 31 rolls around and no confirmation email, nothing. So I called and did an online chat with customer service. They apologized for the confusion, but I was pretty clear that the website stated would not ship any later than January 31. On Thursday, I contacted again and they said it would arrive at my house on Saturday January 3, I made sure to ask that it would be arriving at my house on Saturday, not being shipped on Saturday.
Well, did not get my confirmation shipping email until 02/02. Needless to say, I did not get my jersey before the game. This is clearly a reoccurring issue, it is not just due to the Superbowl. It now says I will not get that jersey until Feb. 08, but that jersey will be returned the minute it gets here. If you need an item quickly or expect it by a certain day don't order on NFL Shop, but if you are fine waiting do as you please. All in all bad customer service, and was extremely disappointed. But Go Birds."
713,2,"I ordered a Super Bowl T-shirt, Jan.26, paid for shipping, fully expecting to receive it before the Super Bowl. NOT! It was in stock and available. I still have not received it as of Feb.5 and according to the FedEx tracking, I won't get it until Feb.8. Seriously. Not only am I disappointed, I am mad. Who cares about wearing the T-Shirt now. There is nowhere on the NFL.com site to write a review or comment, that I saw. I found this site to voice my concerns and see others are having the same issue! NEVER will I buy from NFL.com again. I often shop on-line, from many different companies and have never had to wait this long for an item to be delivered. What a waste of my time and money!"
714,2,"This is the second time I ordered from the NFLshop.com. First was a customized hoodie with name and number on the back. Decal on the back was completely off center! Called them and they re-sent another one. Now order conference champion shirts, waited almost 2 weeks for the shirts and yet another shirt ordered with the underdog decal on it came off centered again. This is how you conduct business??? You have the NFL name attached to your business. I don't understand how this place is still in business."
715,1,"I ordered a Super Bowl T-shirt as a gift for my son on January 24th. It is now Super Bowl Sunday and the T shirt has STILL not arrived!!! I called customer service and they took no responsibility for this fiasco and abysmal customer service. They blamed the shipping company which is not my problem. It is theirs. The ""best"" NFL Shop can offer is 30% off a T-shirt that they failed to deliver for the big day! A huge disappointment and customer service failure. If I had known this, I never would have bought a product from them and will never do so again. The worst customer experience ever! You've been warned."
716,1,"I ordered a Super Bowl Jersey specifically for tomorrow. I placed the order last week using overnight shipping. My jersey is still not here almost 2 weeks later, and is not arriving until the day after the Super Bowl. I’m very disappointed! This is false advertising and I will not purchase anything from the NFL shop EVER AGAIN! You guys should be ashamed! Especially after the fiasco that happened with other people’s orders placed for Christmas!"
717,1,"I am extremely disappointed in the advertising scams that NFL Shop is participating in. On January 21 after the football game, an ad came across Facebook about ordering Eagle Items to be ""prepared for the Superbowl"" as I am an Ajayi fan, I decided to order a Tshirt with the number 36 and Ajayi on the back. It was the women's. The website had Guaranteed free shipping within three business days. I received a confirmation email from NFL Shop. It too stated, ""Your order will be shipped within three business days"" - well guess what?? It is now Feb 1 and my order hasn't even been processed let alone shipped. But they sure took my money.
After a long online ""chat"" with a customer service rep, I was told that the item I ordered was actually a ""Preorder"" item and that there is not any anticipated ship date as of today! She inferred that I was not the first person to complain, however, in looking at the website today and the item I ordered, it is still being advertised as ""will ship within three business days."" So long story short. Don't expect any item you purchase from them to be shipped in a timely manner. They choose to Scam customers into paying money when they KNOW items will not ship as promised."
718,1,"Ordered custom shirt for daughter 8 days prior to Super Bowl. I called Servicing to confirm status since it is the 3rd day and I still have not received confirmation the order has shipped. Rep stated it is in process but gave zero assurance it would be mailed today. Rep advised order is due to arrive February 9th since it is being shipping from Kentucky. I can drive to Kentucky in less than 12 hours but it takes 9 calendar days for my shirt to arrive. My daughter was crushed. Spoke to so called Supervisor Jasmin who provided no help other than repeating what the previous rep stated.
Asked for her Supervisor and she went into complete stall tactic mode by placing me on hold and then returning stating her Manager was not in and they would call me back within 24 hours (step 1 in stall tactic handbook). Also, she somehow did not know the name or number to the President of her company, not the Corporate Office Number, Retention Department and blatantly lied saying she knows who her General Manager (Deidre, If she even exists) is but does not know her contact number. If you are ok waiting 15 days for your product by all means purchase but buyer beware because you have been warned!"
719,1,My girlfriend purchased some Old Spice Ambassador deodorant on the 16th of May 2018. I started using it as of the 17th of May. I sometimes used it once or twice per day. On Tuesday May 22 I felt something under my armpits that felt like a scratch. When I got home from work I checked my armpit and my armpit was almost burnt. There was a rash and some blistering. Looks like Old Spice might be putting some kind of acid in their products. This has never happened to me in my life before. First and last time using Old Spice. I don’t recommend it to anyone.
720,2,"Decided to try Old Spice Fresh deodorant after a sale advertisement at a local store. After using for 2 days, I developed an underarm rash with burning and itching. Stopped using it, and the rash appeared lighter in appearance after using zinc oxide cream. Itching has eased as well. Contacted P&G, where they issued a Visa gift card in the amount of the deodorant price to satisfy me. Decided To go on the web to check about others affected. I have not activated the gift card."
721,1,"This is by far the most corrupt corporation I have ever come in contact with. They deliberately keep these horrendous products on the market when they cause so much pain. I used Old Spice deodorant, specifically the ""Fresh"" brand, and after the first three uses I got severe lacerations and chemical burns under both arms. I was in some of the most severe pain I have ever experienced, and couldn't move my arms. This is ridiculous! These products must be annihilated from the market! Never should you EVER buy any products by Old Spice. And I never will support this company in ANY way, ever again."
722,1,"My 18 year old son has worn this. First day noticed a tingling/burning feeling. Second day little red. Today he is on fire! Blood red and blistered up around the armpits. His first time using Old Spice product deodorant and he has a chemical burn. He cannot put his arms down and literally crying in pain. This is a boy that has broken many bones before but this has brought the tears! We tried washing the area, big mistake! Used our sprayer at sink with cold water. Put burn cream on it. That did not work. Made it worse. I have now put A & D ointment on it. That has soothed him for the moment. I also called the # on the back of the product. No help. Just acted like I was stupid & it was his skin that had the problem. It wasn’t the product. My son is in pain & it looks horrible!! I’m not the first person to have a complaint of this product. Something needs to be done!!"
723,2,"I used Old Spice's Aqua Reef deodorant on 1/21/18, a few hours later, my underarms were red and irritated. Over the next few days, the irritation worsened. To the point of blistering and peeling. I have had to seek medical advice for the issue and have been in SEVERE pain. The company is negligent in ensuring their product is safe for consumers. For some reason the left armpit has fared much worse than the right, and the irritation is around the perimeter of the underarm and not the center... It still HURTS LIKE HELL. Pictures do not do this injury justice as you can't see the raw red 'meat' in the creases. I was forced to select 1 star, but this product is in the negative and so is Old Spice (P&G) for lacking to care for consumer safety."
724,2,"I have been using Old Spice for many many years, the last one I used was Pure Sport High Endurance. I put on a clean shirt and before I left the house my wife said, “What's on your shirt?”. The shirt was wet from the deodorant, I changed and hung the old shirt up to dry. The next day it was still wet. My wife washed both the first and second shirt. Both of them were bleached out under the arms. Time to change deodorants!!!"
725,1,"I've been using Old Spice body wash and deodorant for a long time and never had any problems. I recently switched to Old Spice High Endurance because that's what my wife bought. After a few days I developed this terrible rash. I started itching, it was burning and extremely uncomfortable. I stopped using it and saw that were lawsuits, complaints and it seems as if nothing had been done. People like myself are getting these burns and rashes and Old Spice doesn't seem to want to look into their horribly manufactured product. I hope something gets done because I'm sure it's embarrassing for men and myself to have this rash/burn on our underarms."
726,2,"Returned a pair of shoes on July 19, never heard anything. So emailed the company, and they wanted proof of delivery from UPS. I provided that immediately and again didn’t get a response. Finally called them and was told UPS must have changed the tracking number so they were unable to verify receiving the item. Now it was sent to the refund department, and was told it could take at least a month to resolve. I will never order shoes from here again! After reading all of these reviews, I see I am not alone. Adidas needs to do better when you’re paying a lot of money for their product. Unacceptable customer service!"
727,2,"Sent shoes back for a credit in the beginning of MAY! We're now about to be in AUGUST & I still HAVE YET to get any sort of credit. Called customer service today, they said it just got to corporate and should have to wait another 3-5 weeks to receive my credit. This is ridiculous. Will NEVER order or return anything online again."
728,2,"I ordered 2 pair of NMD Prime Knit Shoes on May 17. I received 12 pairs of toddler's shoes. I contacted them, talked to supervisor which said that they could only give me return label and I have to re-order my shoes, which deals was already expired and sizes were gone. I wasn't happy but I returned them anyway in June. And up to today, I still don't have my refund! I called, emailed, chatted, I did everything. It is so hard to contact them thru call, most of the times line is busy. When I did, one of the cs tried to help me, and he said that the first cs who issued the return label did not attach it to the order, thus refund was not processed. Time passed, I still didn’t have my refund, I emailed them and was told that the management rejected the refund because it's more than 2 months!!! WTH... I'm so mad now. I'm preparing to take it to my cc to dispute it."
729,2,"This was my first time ordering online thru adidas.com - I had a 15% off for new clients and bought sale items. Adidas ended up double charging me for my order and I ended up returning 4 out of the 5 items I purchased. I've called 3x about the double charge - customer service said they had to send it to ""Corporate"" and I should receive my refund in 10 business days. My refund is still not posted. I called today, and the representative said the department that handles refunds never got my refund request.
I still have not received a refund for the items I returned; online it says my return was processed and should receive credit by July 19 - I still don't have the credit. The representative today said it's PayPal's fault and it takes up to 30 days, yet she can't see in the system where it says I will receive a refund. What a joke of a system. I'm so frustrated with Adidas and it's being a waste of my time to continue calling and be put on hold and have them research my issue and get a different story every time. Will NEVER purchase from Adidas ever again."
730,3,"I placed several orders during their 4th of July sale. In first 2 orders, I only ordered shoes. They arrived on time and in good condition, however, in my last 2 orders, I ordered shoes & other accessories together and they both missed a pack of sock in my last 2 orders. When I found it at the beginning, I contact their agent via online chat. It took 30 minutes to wait in line, and he told me he can't re-send the missed item. I have to place a new order, but he already send the request to their warehouse. He told me I'll get the refund in 7 business day. So, I placed it again but I haven't receive any refund or heard anything from them until now and it was on Jun 30.
After I placed the new order for my missing sock, I placed another order with shoe & 2 pack of socks for my friend who lives in overseas, however, when I opened the package, I found they missed 1 pack of sock again. (I did make a video while I open the box), I try to use their live chat again, and it get crashed. I called their customer services line, have to wait about 20 minutes (that's what the voice message said, I guess probably have to wait longer). I leave a message to their Twitter, I wrote a mail to them, none of these methods can reach out them or get a reply.
The 1st missed item order happened on Jun 30. The 2nd missed item order happened on July 7 (these are the date I get the package). I tried to contact them immediately, but it seems they have a big problem. 2 packs of sock probably only cost $11 when it's on sale, but it really feel sucks when they have this kind of services, and I didn't buy this stuff for myself. These are just my overseas friends whom I'll visited in Oct. I don't know what to do since they never reply. I probably just let it go and never shop on their website anymore."
731,3,"I had the same problem as several others reported here. I've placed order and after many days I have not received any tracking information updated, there is a tracking number, and shown Just Shipped. I tried to place a new order, however, my item is on sale, and my size already out of stock. So I tried to email to Adidas customer service, and with no response. I tried the online live chat, but can't connect to an agency. On the phone I've called dozens of times and right now total waiting time over an hour. This is insanely disrespectful. There is no way I can't reach Adidas, so I called to FedEx, and they said the shipping label created, but the package haven't picked up by them yet, so the package should be in Adidas's warehouse. Hey come on Adidas, you are famous, please spend more money to improve your customer service. You don't care about your customer at all. Do you know how much times I waste because of your mistake?"
732,2,I had the same problem as several others reported here. I've made a purchase and after many days I have not received the tracking number yet. On the site the information is that the order has been confirmed and waiting to be packed. Since always. Now the product is sold out in their website. I tried to get in touch by all the ways they suggest. Twitter no one answers. In the chat no one returns contact. On the phone I've called dozens of times and right now I'm waiting 45 minutes. This is insanely disrespectful. Sad to see such a famous company treat their customers that way. Adidas never again. I've never had such a problem with Nike.
733,1,"Ordered my daughter a pair of women's volleyball shoes from adidasonline.us - - do NOT order from this website. After 3 weeks, shoes came - nothing like we ordered. Wrong size, wrong shoe - a running shoe came, not even a mix up on a volleyball shoe style. The return should be at their expense, but they will not take a return other than me pay for it. I'm told the warehouse messed up and now they are out of what we ordered. The only 'good' gesture was to offer me 15% refund. Yet, now I have to go buy volleyball shoes and spend more. Terrible service!"
734,3,"I ordered a pair of typical Adidas trail running shoes online at Adidas.com. I was told they had 75 pair in stock and would ship the next day. After 8 days I began to wonder why they hadn't emailed me a tracking number yet. Tried email no response after 3 days. Tried calling, they simply don't answer the phone. I left my phone on speaker for 25 minutes at one point. They never answered. I eventually had to cancel the VISA card I placed the order with to prevent them from billing me. It's been a month and still have not heard a word from Adidas. I guess they just want your money and that's the end of the deal as far as they are concerned. And FYI their 100% satisfaction return policy is just for store credit. You cannot get a refund for any reason whatsoever, even never receiving it."
735,2,Order a MI adidas & supposed to receive it in 4 to 6 week. It's been over 7 week & nothing yet. Called them couple of time & threw me some fake information. Called them after a few days and now will be ship 8 week after. Bought this shoes April 12 & will ship June 13. They haven't respect the shipment days. Will go on vacation on June 3rd & thought would received it before but unfortunately won't. They could have done something for me to get it before that but they are too lazy for that. Maybe this will be the last time I deal with them.
736,2,"I ordered a pair of shoes in November and never got the shoes, I have been in contact with Adidas since then and never got my refund, I even went thru customer relations where they denied my request for a refund saying the shoes were signed and delivered but when I checked my Adidas order tracker on adidas.com it still said not delivered, I check UPS and They also say LOST PACKAGE so I called again and the person I spoke to said there's nothing they can do. Call UPS because UPS let Adidas know the package was signed for and delivered, I call UPS and they say the package is lost and Adidas should refund me soon and there's nothing else they can do. So I'm just being tossed back and forth between companies, meanwhile it's been 6 months so I can't file a claim thru my credit card so I'm out the $275. Never shopping at Adidas again, I spent $3000+ on adidas.com last year alone, Nike treats and value their customers way better."
737,1,"Adidas, doesn't care if their product, breaks or has a flaw that cause their product to prematurely crack and become useless. Customer service isn't poor, its worst than poor. Bought product from Direct Sports, notified them of the issue and they told us to notify Adidas about the issue, submitted form online explaining what happen and that was a big advocate of their product. That this item must of had a flaw or a defect in manufacturing and could they please help rectify the situation please.
A few days later get a response they were sorry that we were dissatisfied with their product and to contact #. Called the number and it was Dicks sporting goods customer service. We bought the bat at Direct Sports, so I sent a email back to Adidas informing them, no response! Submitted other forms asking for help and clarification, and nothing back. Have been a big Advocate for Adidas Product, but after seeing their lack of customer care, Fact is they didn't even want to investigate to make sure they don't have real problem with a product, that could harm sales? Sad."
738,1,"Wow, I am extremely disappointed with my experience at Adidas. I ordered a pair of Ultra Boost laceless online as a V-day gift. Not only did they arrive late which I was not upset about but when I got home the package wasn’t there. I thought it was a mistake so I called them all week and they assured me that the FedEx driver dropped it off. They opened up an investigation and called the driver. Of course he said he left it at the door. But the representative told me that the driver’s writing wasn’t very clear and he tried to write he took it to the wrong address and then back to a facility. The driver denied it however. They told me to wait 30 days while they investigate so I did. Another representative told me that FedEx has been stealing a lot of packages and that this happens often so they will change couriers. That made me feel like I had hope!!! 30 days passed and no one contacted me so I called and they tell me since 30 days passed I have to wait for an email and can’t talk about this to them on the phone! So ridiculous. So now almost 3 months later I finally receive an email stating that FedEx has denied this investigation so therefore they won’t give me a refund or my merchandise. I find it so disrespectful that such a big company behaves this way. And they can’t even face you. I will never order from Adidas again. They don’t care about their customers. They keep thinking because they’re paying celebrities to support this brand, they don’t have to treat us regular customers with respect. We choose to spend our hard earned money on Adidas for them to treat us like garbage. Now I’m out of the money and the merchandise. Never again!! P.S: When I wrote a review on their actual website to warn others, they did not want to post it and emailed me that this didn’t meet their review guidelines. So Basically they only post the good reviews. What a trash and deceiving company this is."
739,2,"Found a great-looking pair of black and orange Adidas high tops -- apparently, straight from the company's site. Ordered March 14. After a few weeks, I asked where they were. A non-native English speaker responded with semi-intelligible language, telling me sorry and they'll will get right on it. Something finally arrived, and it was a completely different show -- brown and you can't even tell it's Adidas. Based on everyone else's experience, I'm not expecting satisfaction. I think they have no idea of what actual show I wanted, and if they do it'll be a long time waiting. Just wish I could reclaim my money spent."
740,1,"I had been a loyal adidas customer until now. Long story short, my order hasn't been delivered, maybe stolen. For the past 3.5 months I have called adidas, filed claims, spent hours talking to incompetent reps. Every time I was told I will get a response back within 7-10 business days, I have never gotten any response. So after 5 filed claims, hours on the phone, 3.5 months waiting for my refund, I found out today that my claim was officially declined. So I didn't get my order, paid over $100 for it, and at this point my bank cannot help me disputing this charge cause it has been too long. ADVICE: If you haven't gotten your order, filed a claim, and haven't heard back from adidas, dispute your charge right away. Adidas doesn't care about you not receiving your order, it only cares about getting your money."
741,3,"My son saved his money to purchase a very expensive pair of NMD_R2 PRIMEKNIT SHOES. He was so thrilled to receive them and wore them the very next day. Before he even got to lunch, his foot came through the front of the shoe causing him to fall in the hall at school. How does that even happen? One of his teachers even called to let me know that he was not being crazy and that his foot just went through the shoe while he had stopped at the water fountain. She said she had “never seen anything like it.” He was devastated when he got home and of course we called Adidas. We took pictures, submitted claims, returned the shoes. We followed each of their process steps as directed. It is the end of March! They have had the claim started since January 17th. They have had the shoes in their possession for well over a month. We have received no response, no shoes and no refund of any sort."
742,3,"I ordered two pairs of NMDs, one women's Size and one’s men’s size 11.5, and they were shipped with one tracking number on Feb 11th. Got a notification they were both delivered on Feb 14th. Opened my door and there was a tiny package big enough to fit only one shoe. Opened it and only the women’s NMD was inside but the packing label said both were to be in there. I don’t know how a men’s size 11.5 would have fit. I called customer service on the 14th and got a nice guy who probably was new. Told him that both shoes were supposed to be delivered but the box only contained the women’s NMD. He put in a lost item claim and told me it would take 3-5 days for them to get back. Called back on the 22nd because I didn’t hear anything. Spoke with another nice lady. She said that it would take 8-30 days for them to get back with an answer and that she saw a claim had been filed. Called today, March 19th, because I haven’t heard anything. Spoke with a lady who said that an actual claim wasn’t filed until the 25th of Feb and I would have to wait 30 days from that. She then goes on to say that the real claim is one filed with FedEx and they determine what should be done. Hold up so she is telling me that it’s FedEx's fault that the NMDs weren’t in that box and they make a decision.
FedEx in my opinion did nothing wrong. They delivered a package on time from Adidas. Whoever packed and labeled the shoes for Shipment should be the ones at fault. When you look up the label created for Shipment it even says only one item was in the box and only one tracking number was created for both the shoes.
So now it’s been a month of no shoes, which were a gift, and no refund and the decision lies completely with FedEx."
743,3,"I woke up at 3 am to order a pair of limited Ultra boost LTD shoes. I happen to snag a pair, and upon receiving the shoes, I noticed that the cage was cracked where the laces were. So I call Adidas and get the most unprofessional support. First off, Adidas must be just hiring anyone for their customer service because the representatives you talk to do not sound professional. Even the supervisor I requested to talk to didn't give a care in the world about my issue. All he could offer me was to return the shoes and gave me a 15% discount code."
744,3,"My family and I have been Adidas customers for over 15 years. I recently placed an Adidas order online, and spent almost $300 with them. My box arrived today smashed, tampered with, and then re-taped with tape that said “tampered evident tape.” One of the tops I purchased had a large brown tape stuck on it, which damaged it upon taking it off. I called customer service, at first they said they cannot do anything about it, I would have to email corporate. I asked for a supervisor, and I’ll she offered was 20% off item. I am sickened by this. They expect me to waste my time, waste my gas, repackage and label, and a box that I don’t even have because it arrived smashed, all to just return it and remake another order on my time, when this should not have happened in the first place. They clearly do not care for their customers and seem very stingy. Not sure if I’ll be shopping with them again after this awful experience."
745,3,"Placed an order with Adidas December 5th, 2017. FedEx has marked the package as damaged and not delivered, today we are February 9th, 2018. I have called Adidas 12 times, files complain and emailed corporate and they still haven’t resolve the issue or contacted FedEx, they never follow up, not even with a email.
Now Adidas still have my $196 for almost 3 months, FedEx still have the damage package. And I have no idea what to do next. Please help."
746,2,"I placed an order online, but the order didn’t process. A page came up saying something went wrong. I checked my bank account and the money for my order was on hold. I checked my email for a confirmation and there was nothing. I called customer service. The lady asked if I was a new customer. I was. She said they go through a third party for orders and because I’m a new customer I needed to call my credit card company and have them verify my identity with these people. That verification would probably come in the form of three questions. (What???)
I’ve never encountered anything like that in my life. I’ve been ordering online for years. I called my bank and they were just as confused. They made a point to tell me they would never verify my identity with a company like that. I called customer service again and she insisted the order did not go through and the money for the order that was in hold on my account would drop off in a couple days. If it doesn’t, I can call back. This all seems really sketchy for an official site. Never again. I’ll stick to Eastbay and Finish Line."
747,2,"Okay, so. I've ordered a few times from Adidas- in retrospect, I probably shouldn't have continued giving them business but that's another topic altogether. The first two times I tried ordering stuff from Adidas, it wouldn't process my order. I tried a few times to place it, and it kept saying it couldn't process my order. I call customer service, and after a 20-minute wait, they tell me my order couldn't be processed because my address was coming up as a Canadian address, which didn't make sense because I live in LA, and my address obviously shows as such. I've placed orders through other websites to be delivered there and have had no issues so this didn't make any sense to me. Because of the numerous attempts to place an order, Adidas blocked me from placing orders for 24 hours, and my bank blocked my card for fraud protection.
I tried to order a third time, had the same issues. I decided I'll try my work address in Irvine, and sure enough it worked. So I placed two more orders there with no issues. Fast forward to earlier this week, and I place an order for some Super Copa’s. I already have my profile set up on their website, so it was fairly easy to just open up the app, place the order, and have it shipped to my default address (which is the Irvine address.) I choose the free shipping option so I should have received them on the 21 of this month. Well as it turns out, they shipped it overnight, and I got the shipping for free... except it got delivered to my parents' house, in San Diego. I have no idea how they got that address, as I've NEVER used that address for any online orders. Also, neither the package itself or the invoice contained any of my info.... literally JUST my phone number which is how my brother was able to see that it was my package.
I figure Adidas just sent my order with absolutely no shipping information to FedEx and they looked up my name and got that address (still don't know how they would have if I haven't lived there in years, but okay.) So I call Adidas. Half an hour later, I get helped by a representative who was driving me up the wall with his ""I can understand how that is frustrating, but"" generic customer service stuff. I explained to him my situation, and asked if it was possible for them to send me a label that we can print to send it my way, he says they can't. The most they can do for me is send me a return label to return to Adidas, then wait for them to confirm the return, then process the refund and credit it to my Adidas account, and I would have to order it again. I mean... seriously? You ship a package to an address two hours driving distance from me and the best you can do is that?
And the real kicker? ""Sorry there's nothing I can do for you, you can email customer relations if you'd like."" Like WAIT A MINUTE. I've been talking to customer service this entire time, and your other solution is for me to email customer relations? Aren't you both the same thing? Like you really have a customer service AND customer relations department? What? I am honestly shocked at the amount of negative reviews on here. I didn't realize their customer service was notoriously bad to this extent, and honestly wish I would have stumbled upon this website before ordering any more from them.
Adidas, your products are great, but you HAVE to improve on the customer service end. Great products isn't enough to overturn the fact that you guys consistently lack decent customer service, ESPECIALLY when you are at fault. So now I'll be sending an email to ""customer relations,"" which, if the rest of the reviews here are anything to go by, means I won't be getting a reply."
748,2,"My daughter LOVES Adidas, I cannot tell you how much $$ we have spent on shoes and items. She received some Adidas shirts for Christmas from someone as a gift, but were too small. I finally was able to speak to someone yesterday, and I still cannot believe the conversation that took place. The girl sounded young, and like she could care less, she told me that I could not exchange the shirts for a larger size, but that I could fill out the return request and if I was approved to return the items then they would refund the amount of purchase onto a gift card, then I would have to turn around and re-purchase the same exact shirts, only now for the full price (they were purchased on sale). I explained that I was NOT going to ""return"" the shirts and pay extra for the same exact shirts, so she told me that after my order shipped I could call back again, and request a one-time 20% off which would still have me paying out of pocket for someone else's gift, for the SAME EXACT SHIRTS!!! Then one of the shirts was out of stock, but so I asked if my daughter could just pick a different shirt, and she told me no, or else I would lose the 20% offer if I decided to call back and request it. So they do not allow you to exchange items, but instead return items, then force you to buy the same exact items all over again, only for a higher price, WHAT KIND OF PRACTICE IS THIS??? When I asked the girl to explain to me Adidas' policy and the reason behind this, she replied she didn't know, she just worked there, (as it sounded like she was probably on her phone at the same time). I explained to her that we have spent a lot of money on shoes and such, but after this I would more than likely never purchase another Adidas product again, she replied ""ok"". I STILL can NOT believe this is how they handle things, it is like this business is run by a bunch of 10-year-olds, playing store who have NO COMMON SENSE!!!"
749,3,"I ordered shoes on November 15th as a Christmas present for my daughter. I had been searching for the NMD pink Adidas shoes and thought that I found them on the addidas.com website. Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong color and my daughter was not happy with the color on Christmas morning. My initial conversation with a customer service rep was on December 26th. At that time, the customer service rep told me that I was just outside the time I could return the shoes but because it was Christmas, corporate would send me an email with information on how to return the shoes. I really wanted to exchange the shoes, but I was told that I needed to return the shoes and reorder separately. I patiently waited for an email to come from corporate, but it never came. I called back on January 8th and held again for over 25 minutes for a customer service rep. This customer service representative said that for some reason my file was still pending and had not been reviewed by corporate. After holding for quite some time, I was put on the line with Brittany, a corporate supervisor. She stated that I could not return the shoes because it was past the 30-day mark. The number of days between November 15 (when I ordered not received) and December 26th is 41 days. The corporate supervisor Brittany was quite rude and unhelpful on the phone. She stated that Adidas has been really busy and that’s why corporate did not respond to my initial request with the first customer service rep made 12 days prior. The conversation was not helpful or informative. I ordered these shoes as a Christmas present and promptly tried to return them the day after Christmas which totals 41 days. Brittany’s solution for me as a customer was to call back, wait on hold again 20 minutes or more, and try to speak with a different corporate supervisor. I've sent in an email to their corporate office but I know I won't hear back from them."
750,2,"If I could give this company zero stars, I would give this company zero stars. They have horrible customer service. I called twice on my order to cancel. Each call taking an hour... Which is absolutely ridiculous. First, they did not even want to honor the coupon Code on their website. Their website does not work well. I am eventually got a coupon to work. (Someone that I knew really wanted Adidas shoes for Christmas.) After my order being on hold for a month and Christmas near, I decided to cancel my order. You would think after calling twice and spending two hours on the phone with customer service reps that they would actually cancel it. But no, they send the order anyway.
Considering I canceled the order twice a week before it sent... You think they would cancel it. I received no confirmation cancellation email, nothing. The Customer service agent obviously did not do his/her job. Obviously there's no communication within the company. This company wasted my time. Will never buy from them again. I wouldn't even wear Adidas shoes if I received them free — wouldn't want to wear their brand. Worst customer service I've ever experienced."
751,1,"I could not find this company on the Yelp website, so I created their account. I just wanted to warn other parents about their refund policy and poor coach that we happened to get. My son was very interested in soccer and played with my husband a lot, so I decided to enroll him to try out. The outcome after first class: the kid does not want to play soccer again, and he refuses the kick the ball. This was not like that before the class. The sour moment started when I was reminded. Mind you, I did read the fine print, but failed to register that the company's reference to the assessment and team placement meant that the kids started the classes and that was the assessment and placement. It is misleading and not fair. What if we do not like it? What if the coach is not good? If you like it, then you are in luck. They offered a discount for the next enrollment. Wait?! Why would I want to spend more money there, if I decided it was a mistake in the first place? Overall, disappointed with the service. The coaches are ineffective and have pretty weak rapport with kids. My son also attended a baseball course with another provider in the same time, and he had no problems obeying the coaches. The Master Sports coach was basically pushed around by my ever trying 4 year old. The refund policy is not too fair. The classes that were attended could be paid for out of the amount paid, and the rest due to poor service could have been refunded."

754,1,"The absolute WORST online merchant I have EVER dealt with! I make over 90% of my non-food purchases online and have NEVER seen such DECEITFUL practices. BEWARE!

These items Academy.com actually DOES have in stock and will ship quickly. In Stock Online: This item may ship from a different location and therefore is only eligible for ground shipping. These items Academy.com DOES NOT have in stock. These items are probably drop shipped from the manufacturer. To my chagrin, I ordered an item with the later stock status. The manufacturer is out of stock with no estimated delivery date. Yet, Academy.com STILL lists this item as IN STOCK. HERE'S THE ABSURD PART: Academy.com REFUSES to cancel the order! Reputable online merchants would never falsely represent their inventory. And if there were for some reason a shortage, they would immediately provide an option to cancel. My order confirmation promised delivery within 3-5 business days. Now I am in limbo. No delivery in sight. And Academy.com renews the pending authorization on my credit card every time it expires, reducing available credit. My advice: NEVER, EVER ORDER FROM ACADEMY.COM! You have been warned..."
755,3,"Company based in Montreal, Quebec in Canada. Painful customer service experience I purchased the additional Lifetime Membership and a jacket online. Everything was fine with the jacket, i wore it once and could tell the zipper on the jacket was defective. I thought it might need some use to 'break in' but the issue persisted. After contacting the customer service and emailing back and forth for a week, they told me to ship the jacket to them and they would take a look. I purchased another jacket in the meantime to use while this one was gone. The customer service team told me there is no issue with my jacket and i have to pay to ship the jacket back to my address ($20+ tax). I am just shocked to hear that cause i could never get the jacket to zip up all the way and continuously had trouble pulling the zipper up or down. Why else would i go through all this trouble in the middle of winter to return or exchange my only jacket? No return or exchange is on the table with these people. Not even if you are a lifetime member. Absolutely disgusted with their customer service. $400 down the drain."

758,1,"I recently googled Tally's sports cards to see what would come up. To my surprise (actually, I wasn't surprised) a ripoff report came up filed for this two-bit operation. I just thought that I would add my own report, because people really do need some buyer protection for these merchants. Occasionally, I have purchased various hockey, baseball and magic cards from this store. I have spent quite a sum of money there. One thing surprised me, the merchants never showed any manners or appreciation for my business. I spent quite a few bucks there. Now, I am an averaged size man and they didn't give me any respect, but you should see how they treat innocent children that walk into the store. I was in the store one day and there was a 6 year old boy with his older brother of about 12. Now, I'll be honest this little guy did have very curious little hand and he seemed to touch everything within his reach. The one merchant, a man with a rather large head and large stomach, wearing a maple leaf’s t-shirt, burst out yelling at the little boy. This happened right in front of my own eyes. The man working behind the counter yelled, and I quote Get the hell out of my store!. Both the younger boy and his older brother were startled by the man's loud tone. The older boy carried his simpering little brother out of the store. This bothered me, because I have a younger brother, about the same age difference. If it isn't bad enough that this store overcharges small children for Pokémon and Digimon cards, they have no patience for them either. After I saw this, I had a word with the merchant. It was very upsetting for me to witness all of this. That was the las time I shopped at this store. I really would like to think that he was just having a bad day, but I am told by some of my younger brother's friends that the same man was used a harsh tone with them too. Also, similar to one of the other reports mentioned on here (from Joe) I would like to mention that I purchased a set of Ogeechee cards 88 hockey, and half the cards were Topps. I guess it is my fault i didn't inspect them in the store before i bought them. Oh and the Brett hull rookie was missing too. I urge more people to take the time to add there horror stories from this establishment. These are truly unscrupulous business men. Men who need to grow up and stop selling a child's hobby. "

760,1,"I want to warn everyone about a scam being perpetrated by a company trading as Store.Power-Sports-Nutrition.com.  This is how their scam works:   1. On their web site they advertise products having very good well known brand names at sale prices far below what any other retailer is offering these same products for.   2. You think WOW, that’s a really good price and you place an order. You pay online and they send you a confirmation of your order via the Yahoo store order system. So far perfect.   3. One week later when you have not received your order you send them an email enquiring as to the reason you have not received your goods. You get no response. You keep sending emails, still no response. Some time later you suddenly get a reply entitled Valued Customer and it requests you to phone one of their representatives regarding your order. In my case the rep was a guy called Jason Castro but there are other people there also working this scam.   4. Anyway you phone the representative and he tells you that the reason they haven’t dispatched your order is because the brand of the product you ordered is under review due to serious side effects having being reported by many other customers who are using it. They say they are discontinuing this product and recommend another brand which is much better. They will dispatch this to you immediately for the same price. Of course when you try to find any information on the brand they are recommending you cant because it is a cheap poor quality product nobody has ever heard of and certainly not something that you would feel safe consuming. You ask other retailers selling the reputable brand you ordered about reported side effects and they say they have heard of none.   5. You tell Store. Power-Sports-Nutrition to cancel your order and refund your payment. Guess what, the refund never comes and if you keep emailing or phoning they say the best they can do is immediately dispatch their alternative recommended brand as they can’t dispatch a product with reported side effects. Of course these reported side effect products always remain for sale on their web site at very low prices to be used as bait to hook the next unsuspecting customer!!"
761,3,"It started with the release of Rock band for different platforms for gaming. Harmonic produces the software while EA Sports produced the hardware. They released a microphone, guitar and a drum set. Upon the release of the peripherals customers have had nothing but CONTINUOUS problems. Whether it be drum pads not recognizing hits, bass pedals snapping in half, strum bar on guitar not working properly or overdrive activation not working. EA Sports takes you through their RMA process where they are quite helpful in getting your equipment replaced. I personally replaced 2-3 guitars and a drum set only to receive working ones in return without any modifications or upgrades to have the equipment break yet again. Now they did extend the RMA warranty on the rb1 equipment but it doesn’t make up for the complete headaches and countless hours of shipping the stuff back over and over after you already spent $200 on the bundle. Now with the release of Rock band 2 EA Sports releases NEW equipment with upgraded modifications that supposedly fixed the issues from RB1. Ok all fine and dandy I'll just eat the first $200 I spent on RB1 equipment, throw it all in the dumpster and drop another $200 on the new and improved RB2 equipment. (Which I did by the way). Only to find a whole nest of new problems. The RB2 guitar is actually quite nice with its new strum bar and I haven’t had any issues with it thus far. The drums on the other hand are a pile of junk. First off for reasons unknown they decided to make the drums wireless and make you use AA batteries instead of being able to use to xbox360 battery pack (xbox360 only) but they poorly designed it. Playing on the drums cause the batteries to loose contact causing the drums to shut off mid song. The drums pads also at time just stop working completely even though they are on and the guide button works. With all these issues you must also include the cross-talk problems between the pads causing pads to register a hit even when they aren't touched. Once again you may go through the RMA process to receive another drum set and to complete surprise have the same exact issues. So now I have dumped $400 into the Rock band game not counting all of the DLC I have purchased to go through the same exact problems as RB1. Do I now have throw out my RB2 equipment and spend another $200 on Rock band 3 when its released to have these issues fixed? These are the complaints of Rock band 2 on the official Rock band 2 forums with no response from EA Sports or Harmonic on the matter. (((link redacted))) These are just the complaints on the wireless drum set. Forums search will reveal numerous complaints from Rock band 1 and Rock band 2 alike. Damon Carthage, New York U.S.A.

767,1,"Every year that the New York Yankees have won the World Series in 1996,1998,1999,2000 and now once again in 2009, I, my Wife or other family members has ordered Sports Illustrated for me because they offer some Yankees World Series items if you subscribe and have signed up to get me these items as a gift. I'm a die hard fan and retired cop from up there and having relocated far away from my team's market, they try to get me Yankee items which are hard to come by in the south. This year would be no different. Its important to note that I do not and would not otherwise subscribe to this magazine if they didn't offer these items, there are many other Baseball publications I would get before getting SI, period. So the night the Yanks clinched, I went to Yankees.com and there was an add from Sports Illustrated offering the following items if you signed up for a year's subscription. An Authentic 2009 World Series Baseball, A 2009 World Series DVD set and a special 2009 World Series Champion Yankees Book. I quickly signed up for the offer within only minutes of the final pitch in the Series, as soon as the Yankees had won (11-04-09)! A couple of days later, (while staying with my mother in the hospital) I got a confirmation email that I had subscribed, but the email indicated that I wasn't getting any of the Yankee World Series items described, but I was going to get an Athletic Tote Bag. I called Sports Illustrated customer service (from the hospital) because there was no way I would sign up for this magazine if not for the 3 items promised for said subscription. After waiting 30 minutes to actually talk to someone when I called, I told the customer service rep, what the email said and told him I did not want to order the magazine if not for the World Series Baseball, DVD and Book. He looked at my order and told me the email was an error and not to worry. He assured me that I would be getting the subscription and would get the (3) three gifts. Today, my very first issue of the magazine arrived along with an invoice for the subscription with monthly bills to submit for my subscription. As I was making out the check to return my payment, I looked close at the invoice and once again, there was no mention of the (3) Yankee World Series items. The invoice once again said that I would be getting an Athletic Tote Bag!! I called 1-800-528-5000 (customer service) which is located on the invoice. This time, once I was actually able to speak to someone (the only way you don't wait 30 minutes on hold is to press the number if you Want to place an order. If you select any other option such as Discuss your account your left on hold forever. So once I finally reached a human being to ask them what the problem was with my order, I was told that I was not going to get the Yankee items (the only reason for my order) but was going to get one of these other gifts. I told them this was a mistake, that I had placed the order on 11-04-09. The woman (Sandra who gave an Employee ID number of PXH) was extremely rude! She was rude and acted totally inconvenienced for the call the entire conversation. Here were the revelations she gave me for the problem. First, she is claiming I did not make the order as soon as it appeared on Yankee.com on 11-04-09. She is claiming that I didn't order the subscription until 11-09-09 which was wrong. She told me that because I didn't order when I said that I did and under the terms of the offer I made my order, that was the reason I would not get the Yankee items that were offered. She told me she could correct the problem, but because I didn't order my order the right way, that I could now only get (2) of the Yankee World Series items that I had been promised when I placed my order. I was told that she could now only send me the Yankee DVD and the Yankees World Series Book, but she couldn't let me have the World Series Baseball now.!!!! Here is the truth of the matter. Someone I talked to told me the reason they are doing this now, is because they are running out of the World Series Baseballs, so they have messed up many orders because they can't take care of all the orders and just want to give the DVD & Book but no WS Baseball. When I told this woman that I had been getting SI only when the Yankees have won the Series in years past, this fool had the nerve to say to me, Well, that’s not possible, because this is the very first year they have won the World Series!! What kind of people do they hire at a sports magazine that don't know that the Yankees have won more Championships then any other sports team in SPORTS HISTORY!! I was simply getting the run around and Sandra was just coming up with one excuse after another for Sports Illustrated not HONORING the terms of the offer which made me choose to purchase their product! She also claimed to be a supervisor and when I asked if they had a transcript or recording of the conversation I had with Customer Service the first time I called, I explained, THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE REP PROMISED ME I WOULD GET ALL (3) WORLD SERIES ITEMS, she refused to check that information and claimed I didn't place my order on 11-04-09, but on 11-09-09 which was wrong and wouldn't honor anything the other Customer Service Rep had promised in my previous call. I can't believe with all the subscriptions my family or I have made to this magazine back in 1996,1998,1999 or 2000 would act this way. It's just one more reason people should only buy this publication when there is something worth reading in ONE issue when it's on the stand. Don't subscribe to Sports Illustrated because they don't honor their promises and their customer service treats you like crap!"
768,1,"Purchased scooters from them They arrived on a pallet with just the standard cardboard covers with the cheap steel shipping frames that come from china. THEY DID NOT MAKE A SPECIAL CRATE. PAID 300.00 EXTRA TO BE IN SPECIAL CRATES AND PDI TUNE UP... LIARS and CHEATERS While checking the mechanics that they promised (PDI TUNE UP). THE SPARK PLUGS WERE NOT REPLACED WITH NGKS AND BOTH SCOOTERS WERE UNDER 1 PINT OF OIL. (capacity should be just under a quart when full). All the tires had about 8pds of air and should be about 30psi. Within a few hours of putting gas in one scooter fuel was leaking from the carb overflow line in which I HAD TO FIX.As of today May 21, 2012 Its been over two months since delivery and still NO TITLES and when i call/email they keep Lying like they do so well. When the scooters arrived, I filed the online Damaged Parts Claim form per there request and returned a damaged the tire/wheel in April and still waiting on replacement and delivery.

769,1,"I ordered some parts for my motorcycle from the parts department and used my brand new Honda GE Money Bank Credit card to pay for them. They said that they would be there in a week. I went in to pick up the parts and they said they were on back order indefinitely, so they couldn't give me a date that they would be in. I told them to cancel the order and I gave them my Honda credit card and asked them to credit it back onto my account. They called the number on the card an entered some numbers over the phone. 30 days later I get a bill from Honda for parts (remember, I didn't get any parts). I went back to Metro Motorsports and explained what happened. They said they were sorry and they would correct the mistake. It took about an hour, but they dug up my paperwork and called the credit card Co. and said it was taken care of. 30 days later, You guessed it, another bill this time with a late fee added for the parts I didn't get. I went back to the store again and talked with someone in the accounting department. She said she would call Honda credit and call me back on Monday. She did call me and she said it was finally taken care of. 30 days later, I get another bill with 2 late fees for the parts I never received. Plus It went on my credit report as a 30 and 60 day late. I was in the process of buying a home so it caused my credit scores to go down and I ended up paying a higher interest and more fees for my home loan. After approximately 4 months, I finally got GE Money Bank to remove all charges and fees. I asked them to correct the credit report and they said that they couldn’t and that I would have to fill out forms to correct it. I tried, but the reporting agencies said that I would have to get GE Money Bank to report that it was their error. They said that they changed the credit report, but it is still on there as a 30 day late. I have tried many times to get it changed, but to no avail. My Advice is, don't buy anything from Metro Motorsports with a (Honda Card-GE Money Bank). Honda Financial services is OK and I have had no problems with them. "
770,3,"I just bought a 2006 ford Taurus for my wife and our new son, and i thought with the baby coming and the summer here I might as wee tint the windows to help keep the car cooler and the baby from sun burning. I hunted around town for the best deals and found audio sports is the penny saver, so i call and they said they would do the windows for $100 even. so the next day which would be the 7th of April, I took the car, I reminded them I called and they had quoted the vehicle to tinted for the price above. So he rang it up and said that the price was $134 so I paid it, he said the car would take a couple hours and they and they had people in front of me. Well my wife refused to wait and asked to bring the car back the next day, the gentleman agreed and I did so, I dropped off the car and actually paid $50 more for a better tint and lifetime guarantee. so a few hours later I go to pick up the car and there’s bubbles all over and the back window is peeling, the guy say in a week the bubbles and everything will be fine and if there not to bring the car back, and to top it off there was someone else’s car top sitting in my car, there response was they thought it was mine so they just threw it in the car. So a week later I go back and go to drop off the car the guy I talked to claiming to be the owner called the tinter and said he would not be in until tomorrow. So I bring it in the next day and drop it off at 1:30 in the afternoon, leave the keys with the guy inside. I call at 5:30 and ask if my car is done, they put me on hold and said the tinter did not show up that day, after asking him why they didn’t call me and tell me they then changed the story and said that they didn’t have time to get to the car that day. so stories kept changing so I went to go pick up the car when I got there I asked to have my keys and see the owner because he talked to me the day before and promised it would get done. so i asked to see the owner and all they said was bring the car back tomorrow, I insisted on talking to the owner i then got a dirty look and was told that no one was perfect, and he repeated himself over and over, it is now been a month and my windows are still have bubbles and the back windows tint is falling off, after all of this i now do not feel comfortable dropping my car off for them to work on oh and also the wiring for the brake light in the back window was pulled to hard and ruined the wires when whoever installing the window tint moved the unit to put the tint in."

772,1,"Last year I purchased a ticket thru adventure sports for a skydive, went to initial appt. did not dive, told I had two years to make good on my purchase. Now a new year, called to make reservation, was told that I never paid them, and would have to make a new payment and reservation, even though I was there last year.  major rip off, scam, hurtful and very disappointing.  Lack of good business standards and ethics. Third party schedulers suck, and they are still connecting other websites thru theirs.  Help! Where do i go from here?"
773,2,When I ordered my scooter I also ordered a scooter cover. They never gave me a tracking number. However they told me two days to wait for it and it did not come. Usps said they delivered it the first day. now superior power sports seems not to care as does usps. I will never buy from them again.
774,1,"Simple...I ordered a bike on 12/15 to be delivered within 3-5 days.  I paid for expedited shipping to guarantee i had the item well before Christmas.  This was my son's BIG Christmas gift so didn't want to leave to chance.  4 days later I call to check on the order because I hadn't received an email confirming shipping and of course the red flags went up.  I called they claimed the item had been shipped via Fed Ex and they gave me a tracking number.  Satisfied with that i hung up and later that day started entering the tracking number into the Fed Ex tracking system...NOTHING.  I waited till the next day and tried again... NOTHING.  I called them back and they tell me...it's definitely shipped you'll get it well before Christmas...don't worry.   I wait till day 7...NOTHING.  I call them back and they say...hmm?  that's weird...shows it shipped!  You'll receive it tomorrow.  I wait till day 8...NOTHING.  I call back AGAIN...the tracking number still doesn’t show up in Fed Ex...they can't figure out what shipping service was used...they try and put me off AGAIN...they want me to give it ANOTHER day even though it's painfully obvious there is a problem... they have no idea where the bike is, what service was used, and their excuse is because it was shipped straight from the manufacturer!  Needless to say I demanded to speak to a supervisor as we were just a few days away from Christmas at that point.  When I finally did speak to her...she fessed up and said that I probably would not be receiving the item on time!  IF I HAD NOT PUSHED AND CALLED AND CALLED...What would have happened?  My kid would have been without a Christmas gift.  At that point this supervisor apologizes profusely and says I'll send you back to the agent who was helping you and he'll process a refund.  Well...when we start the process he says...ok you should see your refund within 15 days!  WTF!!!???  Really? Totally unacceptable!  I ask to be connected back to the supervisor and I start laying into her about how HORRIBLE the service has been and how i will NEVER do business with Academy online again...to appease me she says ok...I will personally watch the account...as soon as your payment has cleared (which it had, but it wasn't showing paid in their system...just another fail on their part), I'll issue the refund myself...I will personally make sure that you have your refund within 3-5 days at most!.  I didn't really have a choice at that point so I let it go.  7 DAYS LATER...I receive an email with a shipping confirmation saying my bike has shipped!  What The Fuck!!!!!!!!?????  I still don't have my refund, so I call them AGAIN!  The agent has to review the whole case to catch up with all the notes and he starts to shuffle me over to a supervisor AGAIN (which by the way takes up to 20 min. because they aren't sufficiently staffed to handle the onslaught of enraged customers who I'm sure are going thru the same hell as I am)!!!!  I don't have 20 MORE min. to wait on hold for a useless supervisor so I ask the agent...would it take less time to get my money back if I just wait for the item to arrive and then take it back to the store for a refund? to which he replies YES! very relieved!  I said...I'm tired of having to call and wait...I'll just return it to the store when it arrives.  It is now 2 days past the promised delivery date on the confirmation email and I still have no FREAKING BIKE OR REFUND!!!!!  Needless to say... I called AGAIN...the guys looks at his system and says...well the order says it was delivered! I said WHEN?...he says Well it doesn't say...  I say send me to the supervisor's supervisor...hey says I need to speak to a regular supervisor and they can connect me with their supervisor...i wait the standard 25 minutes...finally speak to a very nice lady (they're all very nice...just completely powerless therefore useless)...she says Well I'm so sorry, but obviously your item was lost...I'm issuing your a refund.  It will be in your account in 3-5 days!  It's like Fling Ground Hog Day!  This is all I can do to hurt the them way they hurt me!  In total I spent no less than 6 hrs. of my time on the phone trying to get some resolution to this problem!  NEVER!  EVER! EVER! order from Academy Sports & Outdoors online...ESPECIALLY during the holidays...they can't handle it!"
775,2,"On Dec. 12, 2015, I bought an unlimited member for $96 dollar and paid it with cash. Couple of days later, one of the membership consultant told I was unable to join x3 sport because previous balance I owed couple years back and they will refund my money. Because I really want to join x3 sports, I ask how much is the balance and was willing to pay the balance. They were unable to tell me where and how much to pay the balance since they send my outstanding balance to credit agency. I spoke with the head manager of the gym and he promise he would make sure I get my refund. As days pass by, I did not hear back from him. I email him, call him and even visit the gym to try to get this situation resolve. I finally was able to finally catch him and he gave me the membership manager email and phone number. Of course, I called and emailed him couple of times and did not get response. I finally get response around Dec.29th and he promise to get my refund. Not only he promise to refund my money and he said he only get a check and mail it out me, which will take 5 to 10 business day. It is Thursday, Jan. 28th, 2015 and I still have no received my refund. X3 sports took my money and did not provide any services. All I want is my refund that I am title to have back. I will continue to harass them till I get my money back!"
776,3,"I was disappointed in their customer service and professionalism because they are advertised as an elite organization. I signed up online and paid all the fees and ordered a specialized shirt as well which I was misled to believe that would be waiting for us at the combine we signed up for. That was not my only issue, the problem was that the combine did not run as long as the schedule showed and they seem to finish early to their advantage. There are so many camps offered for young football players and when dealing with youth organizations, we tend to have all the faith in the world that somebody is being honest and they are performing with the utmost integrity, but unfortunately does not seem to be the case here. I had sent several emails and left several messages. At first my messages were basic inquiries asking them to return my phone call, but as time went on and I had not received a response, my messages became a little more demanding and I also mentioned that I would not send my kid to another NUC camp if this is the way they operated. Instead of receiving a response of regret or apologies for their delay, I received an email that said they loved my threat and would only be responsive to respectful parents and coaches. I am a small business owner and therefore consider myself very professional, so to receive this type response from a company that is supposed to help my son's future is really discouraging. I am very disappointed and will be a little more skeptical next time."
777,1,This company should really be checked into...  I ordered a product that I recently found out was off the market after I ordered and this company emails me with the There was a problem with your order please call 1800-463-5001 So I called and waited for an answer. At the end of the wait no one answered however I went to a voice mail for David I left my name and number and the order number and hung up and waited. I called back about 15 more times same experience.  I am now waiting to talk to my credit card company and dispute this companies transaction. I will not deal with this company again and I hope they are found and investigated.
778,1,"I recently purchased a dirt bike online through Powersports Distro.  I ordered the bike on 10/08 for my son.  We figured 2-3 days processing.  Tuesday 10/11 rolls around and we had not received any confirmation on the order.  That night I sent a text to the number listed on the website inquiring as to the status.  To my surprise, I received a response that evening stating the order had been processed and the bike was expected to ship the following day.  I was told we would receive an email with the tracking number the day after shipment.  My son and I were excited.  I was impressed Gary followed up with me that day and I thought I had made a good choice buying from Powersports Distro.  Then everything crashed.  Thursday 10/13 came and went.  On Friday 10/14, we began reaching out to Gary to see if the bike shipped as expected, and to inform him we had not received a tracking number.  We received a reply from Gary stating he would check into things and get back to us ASAP.  Again, I thought everything would be ok.  This is the last communication we received from this company.  Later that day, we tried to reach Gary by phone, text and another email...no response.  I began to get really worried and frustrated that no one could respond with a simple, we are still checking into the matter, etc...  My wife and I decided to wait until the following Monday to see if they just got busy and forgot to respond.  Monday came and went.  My wife and I decided to started digging into the reviews of this company and found that many others have had the exact same issue we were going through.  Tuesday 10/18, I decided to take action and contact my credit card company about the issue at hand.  I put in a dispute to get the money back.  It is now Friday 10/21.  I have not heard anything from Powersports Distro and still waiting for my money to be returned.  Hence, buyer beware...do your homework.  I wished we had.  My stupidity and lesson learned.  What truly boils my blood is I have to look my son in the face and tell him we have been ripped off and no dirt bike.  I hope this letter will keep some other parent from making the same mistake and dealing with the stupidity of it all.  Mean while, Powersports Distro has my money.  For a laugh, read the companies statement why buy from us... what a load of bull. Sincerely…"
779,2,"We purchased an atv from them and when we tried to contact them to find out about shipping they would not answer the phone or contact us back! We emailed, texted, messaged them on their page and called them nothing came back from them. We ended up having to go through our bank and start a fraud claim! This was supposed to be a Christmas present for my son and I had to scramble to find another company to get it for me in time!"

I have none of this. don't get me wrong the bike is nice but. how do i check the oil, ho yea what are the gears on this trike a 250cc is 1down and 4 up. but this one is not that at all. I’m got to learn these gears on this trike and I just don't know what size motor is on this trike. because it's not shifting like a 250cc. so had are they still in business!!!! every time I tried to chat whit Great Sports they just cut me off. So I got to learn the gears and make sure all is ok with the trike. I’m very disappointed of product."
782,2,"Called to speak to someone about a certain brand and model of a pistol ... the person who got on the phone said sorry, I don't know much about guns.  So, I asked to speak to someone who did ... finally, after waiting several minutes another employee got on the phone and was not much help either.  The pistol in question is listed on the Academy Sports web site and on sale and with great reviews and how fast they are selling ... but trying to get someone to answer some really basic questions like how many rounds the mags hold was nearly impossible.  The next day I called a local gun store in Jacksonville only a few miles from our home and the owner was very knowledgeable and explained he had two left in stock and the price was two dollars less than Academy... needles to say I went straight there and made the purchase.  Several days later I discovered that the magazine in this pistol has a very strong spring and loading it can be difficult ... no problem, I called the dealer who sold me the pistol and they informed that most sub-compact pistols share this issue and that i could purchase a magazine speed loader which makes the loading very easy and much quicker ... however, the store was out of stock so I called Academy ... ooops, big mistake ... when someone in the hunting dept. answered they said field and stream hold please ... click ... music ... 5 min, 10 min, 15 min and my patience was exhausted ... so, I called back to speak to store mgr. ... another mistake ... after 4 ring backs and several promises to get me on the phone with mgr.  the wasted time was pushing around 15 min, so I finally just gave up.  If this treatment is any indication of how the corporation feels about their customers, they will not be around forever ... I am done. "
783,1,"Diamond Sports Group is a scam! They invite kids to play in big football games out of state. Charge a lot of money for registration and make promises that they do not follow through with! We paid over $5000 to fly to Virginia for a week of practice and 2 games. Although my sons team won the championship, they did it without his help. My sons coach came from Delaware with 6 of his own players. They started and had the positions they chose. My son plays several different positions, which the coaches were aware of. They put him as safety, he’s never played that position yet coach didn’t seem to care. He had 2 games and a couple quick plays and that was it. My sons dreams were crushed. When voicing my concerns, I was deleted from the group. Very unprofessional, I wish I would have looked up reviews before going."
784,1,"I also went into the contract thinking of a $19.20 charge, but it actually was $1,920. I place part of the blame on myself for not reading the letter sent to me closely enough, but I also don't think a security deposit of $1,920 should required for the flyers. My question is this: Has anyone had any other problems with this company or Nick? Has anyone had any problems of Identity Theft or anything along those lines? I received a 50% refund, which seemed fair to me because part of this is my fault considering I didn't read very well, but now I'm concerned about other areas. I did have to give a Credit Card number and SSN for Tax Purposes...so I think. I can't say whether or not this is a scam. The terms were disclosed, and it is my fault for not reading them. Although, it did say optional flyers, Nick pretty much forced me to get them. But that is besides the point. This may be a legit job, but just be warned that you will have a security deposit to pay and if you don't stay 6 months, you won't get it back. Any help would be great, thanks! "
785,1,"I order a jersey from this person through eBay. When my husband rec' it, he left positive FB for this seller. He didn't take it out of the plastic. When I did, the jersey was not the same jersey in the picture on eBay that we had bought, And the jersey was not from the NFL shop like stated, it multiple defects. I emailed the seller about my concerns. He was very manipulating and had poor communication. The seller finally accused me of a lot of drama because I wanted to return the jersey and emailed me a address to mail back. I mailed the jersey back the next day by USPS. 2 weeks went by and still no refund. I began to email seller, which turn into a complete nightmare. He told me he didn't rec the jersey, then said later he would process my refund later in the week, proceeded to tell me there were no defects to this particular jersey and turn around to tell me he didn't have the jersey again. I filed a complaint with eBay and PayPal. Then seller started threatening & harassing me through emails, statements such as You've been warned, not to file a complaint or you won't get your money, we can play dog eat dog, and there were many more. Because I mailed the jersey back in good faith and didn't get a tracking number (which is my fault), he never gave me a refund. And PayPal wouldn't do anything about this matter. On the seller negative feedback this has happened to other people and the seller replies very childlike calling people names and rude. There are more people out there I'm sure this has happened to, but in some cases he had no choice but to make happy. He couldn't scam them. Come to find out the address this jersey was suppose to go, wasn't the right address the seller provided. He gave some Po Box (not in MT)."

That should have been a hint to me, so being so close to Christmas I had to pay someone to fix it, the starter was bad. So, now to the point, I have need parts since 2007 and can not get them, yes they do reply to my e-mails but keep saying the parts are on order then I got the excuse that they were waiting on the parts to come from China.

Several weeks later after many complaints, their eBay account was suspended. I immediately filed a dispute with eBay. After getting no response, I escalated it to a claim. PayPal claims that because I waited too long they won't investigate, therefore I was ripped off of $28.79. I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau of Chicago on November 30, 2008.

789,3,"I placed an order with sports 55 in December 2010 for a 10 U USSSA travel baseball team. Our season runs from Feb-July. When I placed the Order I was told everything would start getting processed as soon as I paid in full. They did tell me the bat bags would not be in until March and was also advertised online with this info, I told them this would be fine as long as I received them by March. There was several delays with the uniforms and when I called to inquire they could never give me a straight answer and made me feel like I was inconveniencing them with my call. Never once did they apologize for the delay. When our pant order came in, 2 pairs of the pants came in 1 pair being too big and the other for another player being to small. We requested them be replaced with the right size to fit them in March 2011 and to date still have not received them. These 2 boys have had to go the entire season without their pants and not matching the team. Today is June 14, and we still have not received the 2 pairs of pants and the 11 bat bags we have paid for. We only have 2 tournaments left and our season will be over. Every time we inquire about them, we are told that they cannot control when they come in (but of course before I placed the order they didn't tell me this!!) I've tried to talk to an owner but they always tell me its hard to reach him because he is in and out and they never offered to have him call me. They've told me through email that The bags were sent and this was back in May and of course I never got them. In May, When I emailed about wanting to get refund he told me that the refund was already processed. No refund has been received to this date!!I finally got a response from one of the owners named John from an email I sent. He stated in the email that he was told we already received our bags. He said who's lying here. Then after a couple of emails he said he told them to offer me black bags instead of the ones we ordered and said he was told that I said no, we already have new bags (this is Lie, we don't have new bags. Several kids have broken bags).The head coach told him in an email he wanted a call back from him or he would get an lawyer involved. Of course he never called him but responded rudely to his email. He said this isn’t about the kids they have 95% of there things. He said if you are worried about their bags then go buy them some more. Today, I tried to login to my Team Account on their website and I cannot get in. I have NEVER in my entire life experienced anything like this. How could you steal from children!!"

791,1,"I purchased some bars my 10-year-old son saved his own money to buy on jan,1 2011.  I received a conformation email with the invoice# from kota sports. On 01/03, the funds were withdrawn from my account. A month later I emailed them asking the status of the bars.  I get an email back from Gary to check my junk mail and they have a bunch of orders going out this week. Well that was Feb. I have called and left several messages and over a dozen of emails with no response from them. Here it is now May and my son asks will I ever get my bars? I can't believe other reports that this company does not respond and all the items ordered from them are for KIDS!!! "
792,1,Sports display ad is a SCAM!!!  I met with a sales man from this company Bill Swine hart. He gave me his Sales pitch.  At the end I told him that at this time I was my company could not advertise with him and that I would call him when I was ready.  He said that was fine but I need you to sign two papers saying that I have met with you in order to verify my trip to your area.  I did sign them...when I questioned him he said no they will just use this to verify my trip since you do not have credit card info on here you will not get anything from the company Sports Display Ads.  Since them I have received an Invoice for the amount of 858.00.  I sent an email to the company.  when I got no reply via email I thought things were taken care of until today when I checked the mail there was a letter from them saying that I had signed a letter of agreement....and that even though there is no credit card info on it I still owe them.  After calling them company and talking with Kim and Andera in customer service.  They stated that they were unable to help me and that they would contact him.  I called Bill and told him what had happened... As I have not talked to him since our meeting.  He of course did not know what I was talking about. And said he would take care of it... UNTILL THE!!!!   I will post this rip off report!!!! Thanks and beware.
793,2,"In May 2012, I was looking on the internet to find youth sports leagues to put my son in. I came across DYS and saw that they were having a special for Fall registration. I registered my son for their soccer league. In June, I began having random charges from this company on my bank statement. In the end, the charges amounted to over $300. I tried to contact them, but when I called their automated answering service came on saying their offices were closed until SEPTEMBER 3RD! I then emailed many times and still got no response. I immediately alerted my bank of the fraudulent charges and got my money refunded to me (minus the initial registration fee). I saw no information on their website as to another way to contact them so I turned to Facebook where I saw they had a page. I commented asking many questions about the charges and the fact that I'd received no information about the upcoming season. They told me they were not responsible for the charges and they are in the process of making a new website. Those answers weren't good enough for me. I went back to their Facebook page days later and noticed I wasn't able to leave comments anymore. I found this odd so I created another account and went back to their page. Sure enough, I was able to comment using this new account. They apparently BLOCKED me for wanting answers! Here it is, September, and nothing has been resolved. They claim to have everything worked out and have even began offering people free registration. They have closed their phone lines and only provide you the option to email them. These emails continue to go unanswered! I would just like a refund and nothing else to do with this company. They are very shady and un trust worthy!!"
794,1,"I payed to gamble at this sportsbook with swift pay. I evidently left out an account number when paying with a online check I spoke with both company’s and they said not a problem just correct the mistake which I did. The sportsbook told me everything’s fine and that they would get there money so my bets where fine keep in mind this was before I had won. Well after I won 3 times my deposits which was $3000 and had possible win of $20,000 and waited the 3 weeks they allow before you cash out I spoke with them they said everything is fine they will process my cash out asap. Then I check my account to see if it was done and acct was voided and all bets voided. I call and speak with manager Hannah which I had spoke with before she said that they declined to accept money for bets and would keep winning funds since there was no money to cover it when bet was placed. I said But I pay and that was corrected and she said that that was there right to make and change decisions best for them. Which means if they can rob people they will any way they can. I ask for her info she would give me none. I asked for a Manager she would give me none I call back and ask for her manager I would get her. When I asked about their gaming lick they said they didn’t need one, but site does say Licensed!!! They would just do whatever it takes to make a profit lie, cheat, and steal, so don’t deposit and don’t trust this place PLEASE for your sake!"
795,1,"I am a light sports gambler, mostly to make the games a bit more entertaining.  I started receiving emails from Paul Callaghan of Ocal sports, a self professed professional handicapper.  After receiving a couple free picks from him, I decided to give him a try for $99.99 (1 week's worth of sports picks).  The first day he went 2 wins, and 7 losses (difficult to do even if you are the worst sports gambler in the world).  This first day was enough to warrant me asking for a refund right then and there, mostly because it was evident that he did not know what he was doing.... some of the picks had me scratching my head before kickoff.  I was told no, and asked to stick with him and I wouldn't be sorry.  As it seemed I had no choice, and then got to see how amateur this guy really was. The next two days I didn't even receive any picks because his amateur email system was down.  I would sporadically receive boasting emails stating 3 and 0 last night!  Sadly, that 3 and 0 night that I mysteriously missed would be this guy's only winning day and it was all down hill from there.  All in all, he ended up going 9 wins and 20 losses.  Then, he acted like I was insane for requesting a refund from him.  I guess I was supposed to be pleased with these great picks that he gave me??I told him I was going to report him to ripoff report and warn others in forums but he didn't even care.  That shows how serious this guy is about running a reputable business.  If I look on his website he has all of these winners posted, but leaves out most of the losing games.  Buyer beware."
796,3,"Purchased a Demarini Voodoo Paradox bat for my 14 year son to use for summer ball at a price of $249. He used it in about 10 games and noticed a crack in the barrel of the bat. After noticing the crack we also noticed a difference in the sound after making contact.  The crack was deep enough to get a fingernail in and was about 2 1/2 in length. It is shallow in one end and gets deeper as it nears the end of the barrel. To help identify the crack I placed a piece of tape over it to help the inspectors find it quickly. We returned the bat to Demarini. Two weeks pass and we get the bat back. The same bat we sent in with a letter from Wilson saying they cannot find any damage on the bat and that their R&D department has established that the bat is functioning as designed. Really? The store where I bought the bat had 5 guys look at it and all clearly identified the crack and said they would send the bat back. But, Demarini denies my warranty claim? Ridiculous customer service. "
797,1,"I ordered a Jersey from them, and it came with stains all over it. I emailed and asked for a refund. They said they would have another shipped to me after I emailed several times and argued with them. They told me it would be her around January 15th 2013. Its now February 5th and I have received nothing. I have emailed them several times, including the email on their site that says, and I quote Please send emails directly to contactus@sportsjerseysexpress.com. We WILL reply within 24 hours. I have not received any confirmation from them at all. It has not only been 24 hours but its been almost 24 DAYS!! This is unacceptable. All I want is a new jersey. I am not asking for anything to difficult.  DO NOT order from this site. The jerseys may be cheaper but they screw you over in the end. They will leave you disappointed and frustrated, and there is nothing you can do about it. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!!!!"

799,1,"These people canceled a birthday party for my son with less than 24hr notices. For several weeks I called to try and reschedule, but, was unable to. It's has been over a month and each time I call I am given a sad story of why my $75 deposit has not been refunded. Rob (the manager) that just answered told me he has not seen the owner Chris Conway in over 3 weeks so what would I like him to do about it. Beyond unprofessional, this place is a complete scam. I paid for the deposit with a credit card and have yet to be refunded after several phone call attempts. "
800,1,"My daughter played volleyball for Willow brook Sports last year.   At tryouts this year their website stated that Teams would be assigned at the end of the night. That didn't happen.  Instead they assigned the girls to either Regional or Local but no actual team or coach until October.  You are required to pay $550 at tryouts and an additional $1000 before you even have a team assigned.  I spoke with the person in charge of finances at tryouts and told her I wasn't comfortable paying money up front without knowing her team/coach.   The employee (Lizzi) stated not to worry, that I could sign up today (which included signing a commitment form and $550 check) and she would be holding the checks in her office for a few weeks.  She said I could come in and speak with her and if I wasn't happy at the end of the conversation I could just take my check with me.   After being told this, I decided to take her word, fill out the paperwork and pay the money.  When I went to speak with her about a week later, I was not happy with how the conversation went.  I asked her for the check back and she stated that the owner had come in and taken the checks and deposited them.  She said that she could not approve a refund and although she told me I could have my money back at tryouts there is nothing she could do.  She said she would ask the owner.  The owner, Jeff, replied, We will not refund your deposit. Unfortunately you do want to not honor your commitment and you leave us no choice but to take this action. These were his exact words. I understand that Lizzi made a mistake in what she said, but I believe her employer should back up what their employees are telling parents. Unfortunately, Willow brook Sports has chosen to not care about what the right thing to do is, but only about money.  Their response is that they are being overly generous by not making me pay the whole $3,000 fee, even though what they stated online would happen at tryouts didn't and even though an employee of theirs promised me differently.  It is appalling to me that a business believes it is ok to treat parents this way. This is only one example of the many instances I, as well as other parents, have had that are negative at Willow brook Sports.  I would never recommend anyone go here due to the lack of morality and if you are looking for your daughter to play volleyball there are plenty of other great clubs in the area!!!  I'd be happy to help anyone find a different club!"
801,3,"My son participated in a NUC Combine it Pittsburgh, PA the Spring of 2014.   Later that year he received an invitation to attend the MVP Camp in Cincinnati, OH scheduled mid-summer 2014.  We attended that combine as well.   Then he got an email saying that he had been selected to participate in the All-Star Week and be in the North versus South Game right after Christmas that 2014.  I enrolled him in the week long event in Atlanta, GA and paid in full, over $500 to attend the showcase.   A couple weeks before the event we received notification from the High School Coaching staff of my son that due to OHSAA guidelines if he participated in the event then he would suffer a two game suspension his upcoming 2015/2016 football season.   For this reason we cancelled his enrollment and asked if the funds I had prepaid could be held as credit for upcoming combines (which were not against OHSAA guidelines providing he did not play 7on7 or do full contact drills).  I was advised by a member of the staff via email that my credit would indeed be held for future combines.   We attempted to enroll my son in another combine in 2015 and once again was advised by the coaching staff that the combine needed to be listed as an approved camp by the OHSAA or my son could face potential game suspensions.  I once again cancelled my son's enrollment to that combine until I could look into this further.  All the while I was being reassured by a member of the NUC Sports staff that the combine was legit and safe and that they would continue to hold my credit.  My son injured his knee in October of 2015 and after undergoing ACL surgery and rehabilitation I asked to enroll my son and nephew in a nearby combine (trying to use up this $500+ credit) and per David Schuman's email I was all set up and just needed to show up with my son and nephew the day of the combine.  The combine was supposed to be this weekend, May 1, 2016.  Just days later I received another email sating very bluntly that my credit had expired. I have sent two emails requesting disclosure information regarding my credit expiring, since I had never been given and expiration date, and my requests are being ignored.  At this point this organization has gotten away with my non-refundable money and will not even honor the use of it for future combines.   I have all of the emails and have sent them over asking why I was never told I had to use my credit by a certain date and the fact that I cannot even get a response is inexcusable."

Fortunately for me I only bet $20 a game these idiots are all the same big talk no buck. Never pay up front and don't bet anybody that calls you big no matter what they say.    
803,2,"This all American organization is a waste of money. There are no set rules other than all children must play before halftime. This means you can literally pay 450 for your child to get one play in the game. My son got 2 plays. To begin, there is a 450 base pay to participate. These are quote on quote the best of the best players across the country when actually it's who has 450. Next, there is a 50 convince fee for not staying at their hotels of choice. Next, you have to pay for tickets to watch your child play. I have 2 playing so I had to pay 40 for myself and my husband because they played on separate days a 6th and a 3rd grader. Their head coach told them going to the meet and greet affected their playing time. My son went but that was another 27.10. Also, my son had to change his number as well as 2 other kids because they didn't take the time to check the roster before we arrived. The uniforms are nice. The pep rally was great. I loved how they emphasized on good grades. I spoke with the coach to express my concerns during 4 th quarter. He said it was too late all they could do is try to let him play next time for free. I spoke with the owner Donnell Britt and I admit I was loud but at that point. Another coach had lied and said my son told him that his head was hurting that's why he didn't play. I told him my son played all of 10 seconds. He told me that was highly unlikely. Which was true he played longer than 10 seconds. He had two plays to be exact. He said they needed to watch the tape. People do not pay for their child to warm the bench. They gave us a uniform, socks, gloves, lanyard, a medal, and a book bag if you signed up early. My son has went to camps and games that cost more money than this and really enjoyed himself. This whole experience has been terrible and to make it worse the owners comment if your child played 10 seconds then I'll give your money back shows exactly what's important when it comes to these kids. Money and not the experience and exposure."
804,1,"He claimed that the order would arrive within three days which is odd. On the third day he claimed that it should arrive by the 4th or 5th. It never did. He called me and gave me this sob story about people on the internet persecuting him because of some issue with his payment processor. I told him that other people were reporting him as a scam and he tried to reassure me that Surf City Sports Cards is a real business. He talked on and on for 45 minutes. I requested a tracking number from him 3 times. He finally sent one that was FAKE. I confirmed it was fake with UPS. Needless to say by the 10th day after placing my order I requested a refund. He immediately said he would refund my money, but it would take 5-7 business days. Who the h**l refunds the buyers money if the order is actually still on its way? Nobody. It's been 8 business days and still no refund. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SITE NO MATTER HOW TEMPTING! The prices for some things are too good and there's a reason why!"

I'm at the point of cancelling my credit card, even though that's a huge nuisance, rather than deal with this any more."
806,3,"My son was asked to play at the 2010 Baseball tournament in Hawaii with Elite Sports, so we sent in the $2775.00 for him to go on this trip. Two months before he was to leave I contacted Elite sports with the fact that we had not received the team uniform and flight information that we where to receive in March. I was told that they are using a new vender, and that he would receive it when he got to Hawaii. I went out and purchased new clothes, shoes, bat bag, and suitcase for my son to go on this trip. Two weeks before he was to leave I received an email, stating that there was not going to be a baseball trip, and that I would receive a full refund. I waited 30 days after then called Elite Sports. They stated that they had many parents upset, but the checks had been mailed out. I called a week later after not getting a check, and Elite sports said that only half the checks had been mailed out, but I will get mine next week. I then waited...Two more weeks, but still no check. I was then informed by Terry Harrison that he would fed ex a check on June 21st out to me. Now as July 6th 2010 I still have no check, and he is no longer answering phone calls, or emails. I feel sick about this. I am glad that some have received full refunds, but where is mine.  "
807,1,"My son, 11, was 'recruited' to The Steelers last summer after his original team broke up. Coach Rolle called to ask if Sam would come play for him. The Steelers were #2 and we thought it would be a good learning experience for our son. This summer we called Coach Rolle several times to see when practice started (they start ahead of the scheduled time)... no reply. After many calls an assistant finally called to say that...Sam had been 'cut' from the team so the coach could make space for a kid from the #1 team on his team. Words can not do justice to how ridiculous this is and how angry and hurtful this is. The man wouldn't even return our calls himself for an explanation. These are 10 and 11-year old’s... and this coach is a grown man!!!! What does this teach our kids and Edmond All Sports allows this type of practice? It's absurde."
808,1," On Sept. 1 I talked with a guy named Vinny at Jim Feist Sports about there college plays offer.  A week later I again talk with Vinny and he told me I needed to sign up for Inner Circle and Platinum plays to get the best plays. Again a week later when I was talking with Vinny he told me I should sign up for the complete season and I could get in at a discount price.  On Sept 1st, 8th, and 15th each time it was a recorded transaction.  On Sept 18th and 19th I received letters telling me I needed to sign and return these letters to continue the service.  Once I read the letter there was no way I was going to sign them.  They wanted me to waive my rights to take any action(s) against them if they didn't procedure.  I could not make any claims against them and all the charges were non-refundable.  At no time did Vinny tell me any of this when I signed up for the service.  Knowing that there was a breach of contract I did not sign anything.  I am aware of the fact that when you make a contract verbal or written all the facts have to be disclosed.  This is a requirement of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) that any agreement/contract has to be fully disclosed or the agreement/contract is nil and void. Also by not disclosing all the facts we now have a violation of the Full Disclosure Act.  Which again makes the agreement/contract nil and void.  On Sept. 19th I contacted my credit card company and explained to them the UCC and Full Disclosure Act problems and they fully agreed with me, and have taken action to recharge my card.  So far this week I have contacted the FTC and two services in Las Vegas concerning this incident.  I am in the process of contacting the Las Vegas Dept of Consumer Affairs and the Nevada Attorney General.  I will update you when I have completed this.  I also contracted the handicappingreviews.com, which oversees the sports services.  Needless to say they had Jim Feist Sports on their Blacklist and considered the company a total FRAUD.  I will continue to contact anyone that maybe helpful.  Most people are not aware of the UCC contract requirement and the Full Disclosure Act.  That is another reason I have come to your site.  To see if we can get this information out to as many people as possible.  Everything about Jim Feist Sports is Fraud.  I received 16 college plays which went 7 and 9/43.7% and 10 Pro plays which went 4 and 6/40%.  Overall 26 plays which went 11 and 15/42.3%. If this is professional advice I hate to see what poor advice looks like.  I have all these facts documented.  And from all the information I have obtained on the internet it appears that Jim Feist Sports has be scamming a lot people with phony advice.  What makes all this even worst is the fact that most people have no idea how to handle this type of fraud.  I fully standby what I have said here and I am willing to get involved with any action(s) that Ripoff Report may get involved with.  Thank you."

Shells are being assembled and we will begin shipping finished helmets by the end of July, we will expedite your order to 2 day and refund shipping. By 9/28/07 I got tired of waiting and cancelled the order by the link that was provided on the previous e-mail from NexL to use to do so. I received another e-mail from NexL on 9/28/07 that the order was cancelled, and my credit card would be credited and to allow 3-5 business days for the credit to appear. By 11/21/07 and I still had not yet received the credit for the $164.95 (including $15 for shipping) helmet that I ordered. I called the telephone number on the website and the number was no longer in service. The website is still up today (11/27/07) but has been changed to no longer include the telephone number and has a notice that they are not currently taking motorcycle helmet orders. I am most pissed-off and it's not even about the money anymore. I hate getting robbed!"
810,2,"Dr. Ellis is a farce, all show and no substance whatsoever.  I have used many chiropractors with excellent results in the past due to a chronic condition from a sports injury, so I am familiar with many different types of chiropractic techniques. Initially I asked a few questions about his techniques which he didn't answer directly instead giving me vague generalities and insinuating that I might not really understand his methods. Dr. Ellis has a very rigid my way or the highway attitude and openly speaks of his disdain for other professionals in the field.  His attitude comes across as that he is the only chiropractor in the world that can help you. We spoke for about 15 mins prior to the treatment and then the actual treatment only consisted of 3 minutes of direct care.  Those were, however, the longest 3 minutes of my life.  I won't go so far as to directly accuse Dr. Ellis of inappropriate touching, but I will say that his hands got very close to areas where they had no business being.  He's an attractive man, so I guess maybe this is his way of finding dates?  I was repulsed. Perhaps his strange and minimal techniques work on some, but they did not work for me, so I would not return."
811,1,"Horrible experience.  A friend, my husband and I all signed up for an Open Water dive class.  Our spots in the first class were sold out from under us because we were not told that we needed to pay to keep our spots.  The next month we signed up again and would have been skipped over again had we not called and confirmed, due to a miscommunication by the employees.  Each class is a time you are cornered and pressured to buy gear and register for more classes.  When we specifically asked about prices for the Open Water Certification dive, we were quoted two different prices, by two different employees, both of which conflicted with the prices that were listed in their brochure packets. Our experience was so poor at this establishment that we opted to not finish the program, and started anew with a different company.  I will not be returning to Aquatic Sports. I will not recommend this company to my friends.  I do not recommend this company to you."

I've tried calling for weeks, have submitted online requests at their site and have never gotten an actual person on the phone. I left countless messages but to no avail. This company is nothing more than a dishonest scam! Avoid at all costs! I know they get by thinking no one will ever take action but I am taking legal action.

You, also, get the absolute worst tickets. We, also, bought tickets to the Playboy Party. The party had started an hour and a half earlier, and Adam Crum, the Senior Account Executive, finally gave us the tickets. By the time we got in, the party was almost over. We paid $7200. for those four tickets, and he said he would refund our money. I called the next week, and he all of a sudden forgot what he said.

814,2,"I purchased a 2002 Titan Coyote Motorcycle from Coleman Power Sports on (date). Since that date I have had numerous problems with the motorcycle which reflect that the bike was not serviced nor inspected prior to me purchasing it on above listed date. Description of repairs since purchase date: Replaced front and rear brakes (No life left on existing pads) Replaced fork seals (existing seals were leaking) Replaced rear bearings (squeak noise coming from rear of bike, said replacement didn’t take the obnoxious squeak sound away) Replacement of Headlight wiring assembly (short which caused headlight electrical assembly to melt and smoke profusely) SAFETY HAZARD!! *Full Service Completed! (Due to one not being done prior to sale date) Rear sprocket retainer installed to eliminate squeak noise/rubbing noise. Replaced rear drive belt. (snapped while driving down the road) Granted all repairs after purchase date were paid for by the store manager at Coleman Power Sports, however that don’t change the fact that I have a bad taste in my mouth due to the countless issues that have surfaced after purchase date. This bike has been nothing but problematic for me and my patience is running thin as I have displayed endless amount of professionalism and patience till this point. I feel I have been ripped off and taken for thousands of dollars and can assure you I will NEVER do business with Coleman Power Sports again in the future."
815,2,"We and my girlfriend went to Sports Authority simply to see if they had any new products. First we browsed the clothing section, and we saw a baseball jersey that I liked. My girlfriend held on to it and was considering to purchase it. I decided that I wanted to go the basketball section, while she was looking at clothing. She tried a few items on, and she decided not to make a purchase. We proceeded to walk to the exit, and as soon as we got outside a man walked up to my girlfriend and tried to take her pocketbook, and a struggle took place as I was helping my girlfriend pull her pocketbook away from the man. As soon as we pulled her purse away from him, he then accused us of stealing merchandise from the store. We walked to my car and drove away, and my girlfriend wanted to go to the police and report what had just occurred, but I simply just told her to forget about what happened. A few hours later, police came to my house with an arrest warrant, CHARGING ME WITH ROBBERY!!! This is the same charge you get when you rob a bank. First off, the security sensors did not go off, so when the man who did not identify himself attempted to snatch my girlfriend's purse, we refused to give it to him simply because we had no idea who he was, what he was doing, and why he was doing it. If he had came up to us and identified himself as a security officer, and asked to search her purse, we simply would have shown the security guard her purse. Second of all, I have spent hundreds of dollars in that store, and the many of the employees know me, simply from purchasing products there on a daily basis. On top of all of this, me and my girlfriend's name appeared in the local newspaper, Destroying our reputation completely. We both have no criminal background whatsoever, and I am afraid to shop anywhere after experiencing what had happened."

I received this reply from Lorin Hardy on October 20 (now 2 and a half weeks after my order and payment in full) We can no longer offer free shipping on small orders such as this. If you would like to pay the shipping charge ($7.00) your order will be processed immediately Needless to say I did not send the company more money."
817,1,"I purchased several items including a Reebok 2005 Dallas Sideline hat from this dishonest internet store on Sept 19th, 2005. They were gifts for my son's 17th birthday on October 9th. He opened and wore his new hat that day and noticed the bill was sewn approx. 4 mm off on the left side. I notified BestSportsApparel and received an email saying they had reserved a new hat and are waiting for the return from us. The defective hat was mailed back requesting a replacement. Today October 24,05 we received a box from UPS expecting a hat that could actually be worn in the center of the head not to the side. In the box was the hat I originally sent back to them along with a note that said the hat had Slight staining on the inside brim and did not meet the RETURN POLICY Of course, we called them by phone and reach a person that hung up and we called again and that person said THE HAT MEETS REEBOK SPECIFICATIONS Well after calling REEBOK and On Field Apparel, the company who handles the NFL division of Reebok we were told that ABSOLUTELY NOT, A DEFECTIVE HAT DOESN'T MEET OUR SPECIFICATIONS They are in the process of investigating BestSportsApparel.com and how they are representing Reebok along with our dilemma. All we wanted was a replacement for the defective hat. I wasn't asking for money back, just a replacement! My request fell into their return policy of 30 days if that matters for a defective product and the smudge on the inside brim is barely noticeable as if that matters. As if it could be sold to another customer anyway or was that BestSportsApparel.coms intentions! So much for customer service! Beware of ordering from BestSportsApparel.com. In my opinion and from what Reebok said on the phone. Yep, thats dishonest, why won't she just replace it!"
818,3,"Sports Illustrated fraud, non-responsive, not fulfilling subscription charged to credit card 7 months ago. I ordered a subscription from SI online in Nov and they quickly charged my credit card. As of today, May 20th not one issue has arrived. I've tried to call their cuts serv # but I don't have a cuts. # since I've never gotten an issue to get the my # off the label, therefore I am sent into automated operator neverland. I've emailed them 4 times inquiring why no magazines and the first time they told me they had an invalid address and the mags had been returned to them but now they had corrected it and we would receive the next issue and the subscription would be extended. That was in Jan. The other 3 subsequent emails have only been answered w/ a form reply giving me my complaint number and nothing else. I've given them the correct address in each email and they had it to bill my credit card, but we still have not received a single issue! And they do not respond to emails and there is no way to call and speak to a human if you don't have a cuts # (which requires a label from a magazine that we never got). I'm on the verge of writing the president of Time/Warner and contacting my credit card company to see what they can/will do about refunding the +$50 I paid in Nov. I'm furious--this is a huge ripoff and pain in the butt. This was for my son for Xmas and I feel terrible that he has YET to receive one of his Xmas gifts!!"
819,1,I Sent Money to A&S Sports cards in FL. I had Order something off there Website That i Liked so i sent a Money Order to A&S S.C. For a Total of $5.00 for some Football cards. I was latter told V.I.A. A written Letter that i Had not sent enough for payment. It sated only .37 cents to mail two cards. Maybe I am wrong but it only costs .37 cents to mail something. I later Called them on the phone about where my Money Orders where. They Claimed that They sent them back. The sevrice there was bad. I Just wanted my Money and I Did not Get It. Please do not use this Company. 
820,1,"I purchased a Blaster 65 Go-Kart from Pep Boys in November 2007. It was a Christmas gift for my kids. Pep Boys did the assembly and there was a part missing. It took a month to get the part. They also shipped the wrong gas cap for the cart, so fuel leaked while driving it creating a very dangerous situation. We had about 2 hours on the vehicle, when it stopped going forward. It needed a new clutch, fortunately it was under warranty. Once that was repaired, we brought it to our summer camp in another state. The kids were riding, and the front steering knuckle snapped and made it impossible to turn the wheel. That was replaced because I emailed Pep Boys and told them how dissatisfied I was with this purchase. They acquired the parts for me. I repaired the Go-Kart and it was ridden for 1/2 hour and the Drive Belt burned out, putting it on the sidelines again. Complaints sent to Baja go unanswered, phone calls to order parts force me to be on the phone for 25-45 on Hold. I feel ripped off and so annoyed that this thing is such a piece of crap. Please don't buy from Baja, they don't stand behind their products, parts are made in China and are hard to come by and when it breaks after the warranty period, you are on your own. "
821,2,"On May 27, I ordered a 150cc A-56 ATV from all new sports. I requested that my debit card be debited for $1269.95. A few days later the card was debited for that amount... The next day it was debited again for $1308.05. After numerous calls and with my banks help the 1308.05 was credited back to my account... I waited days and days for the atv or some info and finally I attempted to cancel the order. This was to no avail. They refused to answer email and the phone lines were continually busy. On June 10, I received a call drom Estes trucking saying that they were to deliver the atv that day. I hired four people to come to my home and help unload. I could see at once that something was wrong. There were no front or rear racks, no locking system and the color was wrong. When I began assembly, my troubles really began. It would not start because of a faulty solenoid. I managed to crank it with a screwdriver. Then the coil went out. The entire firing system was gone. I managed to get that repaired at my expense, When my daughter tried to ride it, she came walking back. It had stopped and would not start. I towed it home and tried to check it out.. At least 8 nuts and bolts were missing from different places. The next day, the sprocket came loose and the chain broke. I had a friend repair that... Then the transmission hung up and would not go into either forward or reverse. I managed to adjust linkage so that it would go into forward but not reverse. At each stage. I attempted to contact all new to no avail. emails came back as undeliverable and phone lines were always busy. On the advice of Buy Safe (bonding company) I filed a claim with Liberty Mutual Insurance. After two to three weeks Liberty denied my claim stating that according to the warranty, I must return the product to Kansas at my expense. I would have done this except that after checking with other person via internet I found that they did not get service when they returned items. Some were still waiting after a year, This can be verified on your rip-off website. I informed Liberty Mutual, but they gave me no satisfaction, I am stuck with a defective product and got no help from anyone involved. By this time all the cheap red paint had peeled off leaving the original black. I guess I wasted bond money because Liberty Mutual gave me no satisfaction either. Never Again will I be this big a fool."
822,1,"Well I guess I am one of the lucky ones who actually got there spa. I purchased two spas through this company one for myself and one for my parents. i got the same run around that everyone else has gotten from this company. It took them over 4 months to deliver the hot tubs. Once we got them the never worked properly. I could not get anyone from 02 sports to get a spa repair company out to repair the spas. I have since hired two different company’s to come out to my house and try to repair the spas. They told me they have no idea how to order replacement parts for these spas and that everything looks like cheap Chinese parts that they can't replace. Does anyone have any advise on how to repair these hot tubs or order parts. Is there anyway to file a group lawsuit against this company. I know this woman took advantage of a lot of people and she needs to be held accountable!! I gave this company over 8,500 dollars of my hard earned money and all I have to show for it is two broken hot tubs that are collecting scum! "
823,3,"The scooter I ordered on 6/30 was advertised online at $1099. when my boss ordered it, he was billed $1198. I spoke with a guy that said he would fix it once the card was actually charged for the scooter. that guy then did not respond to a week's worth of emails. I faxed the emails and received no response from the company. I called and was placed on hold after describing the situation only to have someone else pick up the phone and have to start over with that guy. he placed me on hold. then some guy named albert told me the price had changed. that's fine and fucking dandy but they need to advertise that properly!!"
824,1,"A buddy of mine asked me to hook up his wife’s car so when they came back i could meet them at the airport and this could be a great birthday surprise. I made the deal with one of the guys and brought the car in on a Saturday to get started on, wheel and navigation only!!! The next day they told me that the guy didn’t work there anymore!!!! I dropped off the car Saturday, they didn’t touch the car Saturday they made me come pick it back up, I dropped it off Sunday still the car wasn't even touched. I take the car out of the shop because I needed to get the windows tinted at another shop on Tuesday they told me it would be ready by Wednesday. Weds comes and goes and still they haven’t touched the car so I already look like a fool to my friends husband that entrusted me to get this done and she gets mad at him cuz she doesn’t have her car. so finally on Thursday night they get the parts but not before calling me that the tires I ordered which i got a really good deal on are on back order and it'll be a few weeks. they gave me 2 choices to choose from but a cheap brand no where near the quality I originally paid for. so I was forced to upgrade tires. they had the wheels on already by the time I came in Thursday afternoon, as soon as they saw me the started pushing me to pay them the new remaining balance of the new wheels so I said hold on I want to see the car. They hadn’t even started on the navigation with one hour till close. the guy came to the back and really aggressively told me he didn’t have time to waste and that they weren’t going to put on the navigation till I closed the deal, he had no time to waste yet he had time to be in the back bouncing the basketball around. finally I go to pay the balance, I had no other choice, and i go back to wait for the car, turns out they didn’t have enough time to install the navigation because it needed to be wired. They told me it would be finished in an hour the very next morning. keep in mind this whole time my friend still doesn’t know where her car is because this was supposed to be a surprise so now she’s pissed and taking it out on her husband. I didn’t get the car back till late Friday, my friends birthday surprise was ruined because of them. they disconnected her on star the speakers sound like crap, these are bose factory speakers, very good quality, and the Bluetooth was never installed, it too was on back order i witnessed the worst customer service during that week and the rudest people ever. These guys smoke in the store when it is slow and always blame the delays on others saying its not their deal. I would never go back to this place again or recommend them to anybody!!! if you do go here never pay the balance in full because then you will be at their mercy! Buyers BEWARE!!!! "
825,1,"They sold me a Roketa Interceptor 150 and when I got it in May 08 it was wiped out by trucker. I called them and they said they would send all the parts damaged. But nothing happened---Parts on order was always their answer---for 14 months. Now they won't answer my E-mails or call me for months. I checked them out and they are Ripping off almost everyone. The owner has now opened Alite scooters in Edmond, Ok and they have the same problem---many complaints. I filed a complaint with the BBB in Wichita and they said they do not get any response from them and told me to file with State of Kansas Attorney General and I just did. If they got you then call 785-296-3751 and file your complaint. If all of us do this maybe the Attorney General of Kansas will get us some help. Lets hope so!"
826,2,"My credit card was billed $24.99 for a membership renewal by this company on 06/29/2009 without notifying me and without any authorization by me. It is obvious that this is an intentional action by Roadrunner Sports to bill unsuspecting former customers who might overlook this charge. When you call them to dispute the charge, you are greeted by a pre-recorded message cheerfully explaining that the recent charge on your card is just a renewal fee for your extremely valuable membership but if you would like to speak to someone about that charge just press 1. While they quickly agree to refund the charge (as yet I have not seen it!), this only serves to confirm that they are mass billing former customers hoping to pick up some free cash from those people to whom $24.99 is not the sort of charge that rings alarm bells (Maybe I really did renew that membership, whatever it is?). Any argument from them would only send customers to the BBB in droves. If they do not respond soon, I will dispute the charge through my credit card company and submit a report to the California BBB. As it is, I intend to submit a poor rating to www.resellerratings.com. The 10 minutes I had to spend to resolve the problem was ten minutes more than I should have. Additionally, the last purchase I made from Roadrunner Sports was more than a year ago. I never authorized them to retain any of my credit card information. This company is bad news - period."
827,3,"I purchased a Go Cart on 6/04/2008, it came scratched, wrong color, exhaust broken, missing parts. I attempted to contact All New Sports and no answer, left numerous messages with no reply. Finally, spoke to someone and they said they would shit replacement parts and I never received parts. So I called back and got no answer and left more messages with no response. Currently, the Go Cart I purchased in not able to be used due to a broken exhaust, starter, clinoid, faulty wiring. And to date the company can not be contacted in no shape or form. This go cart is still under warranty. So i paid $2,149 dollars for a go cart that is a piece of shit. I do not know what else to do to get this issue resolved. "
828,3,"I would like to provide information to other travelers about the Norwegian Cruise Line. My husband and I sailed on the Getaway on June 12, 2017. First, the crew was very nice and our cabin was small but very clean. We had a balcony cabin. However, this ship is enormous. It took a significant amount of time to return to the ship after shore excursions. Also, we missed two ports of call because the ship could not get into Warnemunde in Germany for a day and a half. The weather would not permit the ship to enter the harbor. We went into Warnemunde a day late which meant that we missed the tours we booked. Then, we had to skip a call at Tallinn. So we missed our tour there as well. Other, smaller ships were able to get into ports.
The shore excursions that we were able to take were very good. However, the ship is just too large with very little quiet space or educational entertainment. There was no one aboard to provide information on the places that we were about to see. Most of the venue on the ship are crowded and very noisy. Big party crowd. The large scale entertainment was very good but no smaller groups. Ship has climbing wall, rope course, etc... good for families but not for people wanting intellectual stimulation. Lots of stupid game shows etc... Food was reasonably decent but not great. Norwegian needs to either use a smaller ship for the Baltic or needs to dock at places where the dock can accommodate such a large ship."

830,1,"I ordered a dirt bike for my eight year old b-day and paid 600 dollars for it. When we got it of was damaged, the fender was cracked it leaked oil and the plastics on the tank were cracked. We sent pictures of the damage the day we got it and was told by Albert that he would send replacement parts and handle it. Weeks went by and he never called, e-mailed or sent the parts. When we called him back he told us to call the shipping company because it was their fault and they refused to replace it. We called the shipping co. only to be told that powersports had to forward the pictures and handle it. Needless to say, we've been dealing with this for almost 3 months now and my son still don't have his birthday gift that he saved his money for! They won't return calls or e-mail and have started just leaving us on hold until we hang up when we call now. I asked to speak to Bill and was refused also. Anyone else out there with the same problem or similar problem can contact me and well file suite together. Meanwhile I'm contacting the BBB and whoever else I need to until my child gets his b-day gift we promised him. I don't recommend anybody buy anything from this company.

831,1,"I found a 2004 Tahoe Z71 on eBay about April 1, 2009. I watched as it did not meet the buy now of 13,500. I called after and offered a cash price of $11000, which they accepted. I deposited $500 based on Times statement that he was brokering it for his friend, and that he had Title in hand, and the inclusion of a warranty. I transferred the rest of the $ on 4/08/2009. The vehicle was delivered 3 days later. Not mentioned in the ad on eBay, nor in the pictures on the website was damage to the fender flare on the L passenger door, as well as some minor stuff. The Biil of Sale, Title and Warranty were all to be in the glove. Nope. I called him the next day. No answer. The next day, no answer. repeat for 1 week. Finally get him to answer, and he says you will have it by Friday (the 15th of April). Nope. I called several times and he came up with I must have sent it to wrong address. So I gave him the correct address, which was actually the same address. I called and texted him daily. Finally I got so upset i called the Texas DMV and got the info. on filing a complaint. I texted this to Tim. What do you know, he calls in like 2 seconds pleading with me not to file a report. He overnights the title and I finally get its on May 14th (yes, 40 days). He also promised to pay my fine for not tagging the truck in 30 days, which made it undriveable. This forced me to pass up a sale on my other vehicle and cost me a total of $780. So At any rate 2 weeks have gone by and I have not heard from him, so I will file this report and one with the state of Texas. Don't buy from Prosper Motor Sports. Typical Used car salesmen."
832,3,"On 27 Oct. 2013, I sailed with Norwegian Cruise Line out of New Orleans, LA for seven days. I first needed to put down a three hundred dollar deposit. I went to the ATM and would not release any funds off my card. After putting in my pin number, it would kick me out. I went to customer relation desk, a representative escorted me back to the ATM, and we tried to access my account more than 10 times. I was informed to go the bank in Belize and get some funds. I arrived at the bank of Belize and they informed me that I could only get Belize Money.
Once I returned to the Cruise Ship, I informed the same Representative that I need to access my account to get some funds. I was then told to access it through the Casino. Well I did, only to get charged a service fee of 15 dollars. Now the charges for ATM is $5.50, wow. Now I have cruised on Carnival, Celebrity, and Princess and never been charged a fee. I logged onto my account today to find that Norwegian has charged me my full bill of $1982.05 and still the previous charges that are still pending well $2,500.00.
If I go shopping and they debit my account and the charges are pending, the business will not in my account for that same transaction twice. Why would Norwegian put their customers in a financial hardship. I was not informed that the money that is accessed through the casino would have a service fee at first. With that said, why would this be pending charge if it is through the casino and the customer is paying a service fee, like at the ATM. Why is the charges pending?
I would like for Norwegian to explain why they overcharged my account more than double. I can't access my money. I called Norwegian customer relation and spoke with Rita (very customer friendly representative), although before Rita came on the line they have a recording that states the following: If this is concerning a pending charge it will drop off in three business days. Wow, this must be a reoccurring problem. I would appreciate any help of Noewegian with this for future cruisers and myself. Thanks."

834,1,"Hello my name is Frank, and I am originally from Canada. At present I am an Automotive Importer for a Car Dealership that specializes in selling American Cars and trucks, in Italy. In early Nov. 2008, I wired money to Cleburne Motor Sports for the purchase of a 2006 Dodge Ram SRT. The person that I contacted at the dealership was Julie Clark. In the past 4 years I have bought over 100 vehicles in the US all by way of the internet, and have never had a problem till now. Julie provided me not only with her International Banking coordinates, but also with the name of someone at her Bank that I could correspond with to make sure that the money I was wiring, arrived. After, a lengthy delay I finally got word from Julie's Bank that the money had finally arrived. That's when everything started to go wrong! Julie informed me that Robert her husband had sold my vehicle to someone else. A little mad, I then asked her to do the right thing and wire me back my money through her Bank. I was told by Julie that the money had gone into another account (lies!), and that it would take time to sort out! She assured me in an e-mail that she would never think of keeping my money. However, I know for a fact that all they (Robert or Julie) have to do, is go into their Bank and sign an Authorization form to start the re-wire back to Italy. This was confirmed to me by their Bank Representative. They still have not done this!!! The biggest problem I am having is getting in touch with them. I have 2 Office Numbers: 1-866-728-9651 & 1-817-641-7502 2 Cell Numbers: 1-817-202-5844 & 1-817-992-8068 1 Fax Number: 1-817-202-9460 and 1 e-mail address: I am amazed that with all these Numbers that I cannot get a hold of them! Other Complainants in ripoffreport.com have had similar experiences with them not answering! I have filed a complaint with the Texas Department of Transport and am getting daily feedback from their Bank. Their Representative is the only positive, out of this whole mess, and she is really trying to help me get my money back for me. My advise? Buy a vehicle from someone else! Avoid the headaches and read all the other complaints on the site from other frustrated buyers. As well, I would love to get in touch with any Collection Lawyers in Texas that would love to handle this rip-off. Please e-mail me. "
835,1,"On 9-16-08 I ordered a 250cc scooter from County Motor Sports (CMS). I received the scooter 10-10-08 and found it to be the wrong scooter. As advertised, the scooter was supposed to have a remote start and alarm. radio, and a large upgraded trunk. The unit had none of these things. I have contacted this co. at least 12 times with no results. I have checked on the Internet and find that I am not the only one that has been ripped off by this co. The Internet reports had the same problems as I have and I feel that this is a common practice of this co., to take your money and send you what ever they want you to have. It seems that what you order is irrelevant to these people. They are just simply after your money and after they get it, you are just left blowing in the wind. I am posting this report because I want people to know that this company is not to be trusted and if you order from them don't expect what you paid for unless they are overstocked with your item. They also have many phone numbers and Email addresses but don't expect any response from them unless you are about to make a purchase."

837,3,"The escape ship organised a poker tournament satellite for the main event that will be held in November 2018. The total prizes were 4100$. Norwegian Cruise Lines didnt put any money in the prizes, all the money come from players' buy in (which is ok). The first prize consisted of the cost of the buy in and the complimentary accommodations (I don't understand why the use of complimentary if it's being bought from money of the prize) for the main event held in November 2018, and the leftover which is 1100$ was given to the second place (We were told that the worth of the first place is 3000$).
The first prize breaks down into 1100$ for the buy in at the main event, which leave 1900$ for complimentary stateroom accommodations. When I make my reservation today I realise that if I buy the cruise myself it would have cost me about 1200$ (tax and fee are excluded). Where the 700$ that is missing went. I have been told that because the prize value is based on a full rate value... When they never sell at that price. The only logic I can see is they use the opportunity to manage tournaments prize (again Norwegian Cruise didn't contribute) to sell to the winner a cabin at full price. I don't find that fair. It would have been fair that Norwegian Cruise Lines applies the full winning prize (less the tax and fee) to my reservation. It's too bad because I loved my cruise, everything was perfect beside this."
838,2,"During December 2008 my daughter purchased (2) pocket bikes from USA Power Sports. I was at a military deployment class and did not get to assemble the bikes until I got home the week of Christmas. In assembling them I found both of the bikes had leaks in both gas tanks and closer inspection found cracks in the pull starter or motor case. I tried calling the company and all I got was a recording. When I finally got hold of someone from the company (female sales person) I was promptly informed that I needed to read the warranty agreement before buying their bikes and that since gas had been put in the tanks this made the bikes used and they could not be returned to the company. To no avail would the person let me talk to their manager, or help with the problem of returning defective equipment. Especially since other bikes had been purchased so the grandkids would not be disappointed at Christmas. Since then (January 02, 2009) my daughter finally got an e-mail answer that we could make pictures of the damage and they would validate or replace what was damaged. All I want is my money back for bikes that did not work. "
839,1,"I'm Glad I found this web site so I can vent my frustration with All New Sports of Newton, KS. This company is the worst I've ever dealt with and if anybody out there who would be interested in starting a class action suit against these folks then sign me up! I bought a 150CC J M Star scooter in June of 2008 from these guys. After only 1,500 miles under very conservative driving and regular maintenance, the main motor bearing shattered. After pushing it about 3 miles to my home, I contacted All New Sports about my situation. It took several phone calls (phone calls go directly to voice mail, nobody personally answers incoming calls) and emails for somebody to get back to me. I informed them of the failure and was told to send the engine back to them for repair. The warranty would only cover parts and return shipment. So I took to a motorcycle shop and they pulled the engine and repaired a stuck kick starter. The cost of the labor was $180.00. I took the engine, boxed it up securely and shipped it to All New Sports at cost of $70.00. It arrived on January 9th, 2009. I was told by their tech support manager (John) that it would be repaired and returned to me in about 30 days. OK, fair enough. After a couple of weeks I had not heard a thing so I emailed and called them several times to inquire about my repair. I heard nothing back after a few days so I kept trying. Finally, I got an email stating they were waiting for a part. I inquired again about more detail but heard nothing. After several more calls and emails, I finally received an email stating that I was to be patient and the repair will be completed in due time. After 1 month I still had not heard anything so I called and emailed again with no response. It took another week before I received another email stating my repair is going fine and I will be updated at a later time. So, I waited again. Another month went by and I had not heard anything despite continued emails and phone calls. By chance one day in early March, 2009 (2 months after they received my motor for repair) I finally got through and spoke to an actual human being in customer service. She told me they will look into my repair and tech support would call me back. I called again the next day and got the same response, yet nobody would follow up with me. At this point I have had it with being jerked around! I called again and expressed my discontent with their service and demanded to talk to a supervisor, manager or owner. I was refused and was told that the owner does not talk to customers! After a week I got an email stating my repair is going fine and should be shipped out within a day or two. That was reassuring but I was skeptical. Finally, I got a call from the tech support manager (Colby) and he asked me what was the problem with my engine! What???? They've had my engine for 2 months, I faxed them the repair analysis from my mechanic and now they ask me what is wrong? As it turned out my engine sat in a corner for 2 month and nobody even looked at it!! Needless to say, I was furious and let them know how poor their service is and again asked to speak to the owner. Again, I was refused. At this point all I wanted was my engine repaired, sent back to the cycle shop and move on with my life. The engine finally arrived in late March, 2009 to the cycle shop. It was poorly packed in a plastic moving tub and only wrapped in a U-Haul moving blanket. It didn't look very good and I could only hope it survived the shipment and would work. The cycle shop put the engine back in and fired it up... it worked! However, the mechanic informed me that this engine was not mine because it has California emissions on it AND the kick starter needed repairing! I already paid him for the repair of the kick starter on my engine, now I paid again to repair the kick starter on a replacement engine they had sent me! The final bill for the repair was another $280.00. This combined with my earlier repair and shipment added up to a grand total of $430.00. The scooter retailed at $1,200. I paid for the same repair twice AND All New Sports didn't inform me that they were sending me somebody else's engine!!! My engine had only 1,500 miles on it and I have no idea the condition of the engine or how many miles on it or even if it will last. I suspect they stripped my newer engine for parts and gave me some older engine and called it good enough! At this point, I am completely unsatisfied with my customer experience with All New Sports. I will contact the Kansas Attorney General and file a complaint with them. If anybody out there has similar stories like this and want to start a class action suit then I all ears! ALL NEW SPORTS IS A RIP OFF AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST. THEY STOLE MY ENGINE!!!! "
840,1,"How foolish of myself that I used my debit card to process the purchase online, I never thought such a fancy site would rip me off like this, $69.99, That is the amount I paid for this worthless junk. 1. The Item was not performing as it described 2. The Item was Piece of resister that fooled the customer because it was covered with hard plastic 3. Request for RMA, since it was 100% money back guarantee. 4 Contact the customer support but the customer support was asking many follow-up questions. (said no questions to be asked) 5. I constantly answered all the question why I was not satisfied with this product, Finally Give me an RMA number. 6. the Item was sent back to where it came from. 7. its been 2monthes, I followed up every week, the customer support is reluctant to answer my questions. This is a total scam, please do not purchase this scam junk. I lost my money and still regretting of my foolishness."
841,1,"On 5/5/08 I ordered a 250cc Ronoco motorscooter from Allnewsports.com per phone. I paid $2376.95 for the scooter with a lifetime warranty. My battery went dead several times since I purchased the scooter. On July 23, 2008 I emailed the parts department at parts@allnewsports.com & their service department at service@allnewsport.com. I received an email from Carl M, Parts Manager, stating that I needed to send the voltage regulator back to them. I sent, by certified mail the bad VR which was received by them on July 28, 2008. When I spoke to them on the phone they indicated that it would take about 5 days to return to me a new VR. On 8.1.08 I sent an email to Carl M asking when I will receive my new VR. On 8.4.08 Carl M emailed me stating that I should get my new regulator within 10-12 days. It's been 16 days now and I am still waiting for my VR. I have tried to call them, but all phones go to voicemail. Since July 28, they have had 16 days to return a new VR to me. I sent an email on 8.11 asking when I can expect my VR. I tried to call them today but my phone call went to voicemail. I did leave a message but have not had a response as of yet. I feel that Allnewsports.com has not lived up to their warranty expectations/conditions. I feel that Allnewsports.com should uphold their warranty that they are selling with the scooters and they need to be more responsive to consumers that they have sold scooters to. If Allnewsports.com is not going to honor their lifetime warranty, they need to cease selling it and refund my money for the warranty. I paid $179 for a lifetime warranty. Kansas Corporations Division has this entity dissolved as a business. Business Entity ID number 4022182 has been dissolved with the Kansas Secretary of State. All new sports has changed their website to be exclusively ATVs. I have found another web site called www.alitescooters.com. The lay out is the same as what allnewsports.com was. I was searching through alit scooters vehicles FAQ's and under What do I do if my order is lost or damaged and on the reply #2 & 3 states: All noted damages must be reported to allnewsports.com via e-mail within 3 days of delivery, no exceptions. 3. Please save original packing material for investigation by the shipping company. Please take pictures of the damaged boxes and vehicle and send the pictures to parts@allnewsports.com within 3 days of delivery. So, why is alit scooters using allnewsports.coms email addresses? I read where another consumer contacted alitescooters.com and he was told to contact allnewsports.com. Something is not right about both these sites. I have made complaints with the Federal Trade Commission, the Washington State Attorney Genreal, Consumer Protection Division and the Kansas State Attorney General, Consumer Protection Divisions office, and have lodged a complaint with the BBB. If there is an E-Commerce site that I can make a complaint to, I wish I knew what it was, because I would make a complaint there as well. "

843,3,"My wife and I took a cruise, September 19-28, on Norwegian Getaway Cruise Line. The staff was friendly and we had a great vacation. When I received my final bill there was a charge of $7.67. I went to customer service and they said the charge was for a beer. I explained to them that I nor my wife drink alcoholic beverages, we never have. Very politely they said it would be taken off my bill.
When I got home the charge of $7.67 was on my credit card, plus another charge. I called Norwegian, they said the other charge was for another beer charge on the last day of the cruise. So I got charged for two beers, plus I was lied to. Either someone got into my room and took two beers or Norwegian is creating a scam on their customers like Well Fargo did. I have one question for Norwegian Cruise Line, if you were me, would you book a cruise through Norwegian? I truly hope this is a mistake on Norwegian's staff and not a scam. If Norwegian corrects their mistakes and refunds my money for the two beers, I accept their apology. All I want is my money refunded."
844,1,"Grand Slam does business through amazon.com.   I placed an order on 3/11/2010, they claimed to have shipped it the same day.  My account was charged 2 days later.  As of 3/28/2010, I have not received my order.  It is a small package reportedly sent 1st class mail.  From Georgia to Michigan should not take 3 weeks.  I have written three e-mails and made one phone call, all of which have not been answered.  Perhaps my order got lost in the mail, but with no response from the company, it is more likely never sent.  I am now forced to report it as a fraudulent charge to my bank."
845,1,"After taking a 2 week trial membership last year, I was asked to sign a contract for a year membership.  As I explained to the rep, I was unemployed and would not have been able to pay for a membership.  The rep told me that the company would automatically cancel my membership due to financial hardship if I found that I could no longer pay.  I asked if this were in the contract and the answer was no but the rep said that he would honor it and remember.  I did not join. I am a member now and was told that I had access to the gym in both Marietta and Atlanta for $69 per month.  I found out later that this wasn't true and I only had access to the Marietta location.  I was also told that my rate of $69 per month was the lowest rate possible. However a good friend is a member and she pays $49 per month and is able to use both gyms as many times as she wants.  This is a $20 difference!  My plan is a restricted 3 times a week plan.   When I complained about the rate that I am paying versus my friend, I was told that nothing could be done.  When I asked to speak with the manager, he was never available nor would he (Brandon) return my VM.   I am so sorry that I joined X3 Sports.  The folks that sale contracts are sneaky, deceptive and seem to be allergic to the truth.   They don't realize that what goes around comes around. I also belong to another gym and I have never had any issue with them.  The owner is above board and the membership rates are standard across the board.  The gym also honors corporate accounts and that rate is standard across the board.   When World became aware of my unemployment situation, they worked with me. They have a heart and soul. I say Beware spend your money on something else like Crossfit which has no membership contract to sign, purely month to month, leave and come back when you want without a 30 cancellation clause with the manager's signature. The workouts are intense.  I wish I had heeded my own advice.   I made an expanse mistake by joining X3 Sports."
846,1,"Worst store to have to deal with, shady sales techniques and switch and bait too. Avoid at all Costs. Sold me an item that was on sale, sent me email confirming this, later sent another email showing when it should be at my door step.4 days later they send a email saying order canceled because it is out of stock. I checked online and it shows in stock and a higher price now, I called and they say it's in stock, but at a price over 3 times higher. They can put the order in, I say NO, then they offer 20% discount. That is still higher than I could get them from many other stores. They tried to say it was a pricing error , but they sent email just saying it's out of stock, to try to get me to order at inflated price. Also reported them to BBB."
847,1,"Sadly, I wish I had checked before buying! It seems that another customer has had problems with BRAVO SPORTS - VARIFLEX products. Hopefully others will read before they buy any products from this company! My complaint is this: We purchased a trampoline for our boys for Christmas (2009). Dad put it together and they finally we able to enjoy it that afternoon. We have 4 boys. 15, 13 and 10 year old twins. Our older boys are big boys and as such were only allowed on one at a time. The twins are 70 & 75 lbs. Mind you the weight limit is 250lbs. So they enjoy the trampoline Friday night, Saturday and part of Sunday. By Monday the springs are completely stretched out and the bounce is gone. OK, maybe we got bad springs… right? Hubby calls the company and they have the nerve to say we are at fault because the twins bounced together! First of all, no where in the paperwork does it say one person at a time because of the weight. It says one person at a time because of the risk for serious injury. Keep in mind the twins together only weigh 145lbs. Way below the limit of 250lbs. The supervisor was extremely rude to my husband and refused to honor the warranty of their product used for 3 days! We are now returning the product to Kmart where we bought it. Tsk Tsk Bravo Sports... Shame On You!!"
848,1,"John sold me my ATV and charged me for extended warranty service.  When my air filter busted only three months later, I brought it in and had it repaired.  THERE WAS NO REPAIR, they only cleaned out the dust and sent me on my way.  3 months later I was back again -THANKS FOR WASTING MY TIME!!!!!!!!!! John is a lier and doesn't even work there anymore.  He charged me for the warranty and never set it up.  Now if I want to get my Sportsman fixed, I have to pay for the f***ing dust filter to be replaced.  Thanks for wasting my time and money.  Sincerely, Cheated and Lied To!!!!!"
849,1,"When I had received my scooter on 4/28/08 it had minor scratches and the fuel gage is not working.  So I had called and spoke with Parts Manager Carl M, I had sent faxes, called and only one call back that they would replace the parts, no parts.  The battery is not holding charge, and the scooter is now not working at all. I feel ripped off an taken advantage of by this company, an have no way to get in touch with them any longer. I felt the scooter would be perfect only because the gas price kept rising. Now I have a product that is of no use to me that I paid for.  MC-08 Rocketa Maui 50 Deluxe.  I don’t know what I could do about this matter and hope someone could help me."
850,2,"Trip to Cuba - Hurricane Irma created flooding and destruction in Havana. I live in Florida and also suffered damages from Irma. No power until a few days right before the cruise. Needless to say these two problems necessitated me to request a cancellation or rescheduling of the trip. NCL replied with ""The port is open and we are sailing."" No refund no reschedule. Since then I have learned that there is fungus mold and bacteria from the streets that were flooded. The seas were still turbulent as the hurricane was still moving north. I will never use NCL again."
851,1,"I went to Omega Sports to sell some old baseball cards on 2/6/12.  While looking through my booklet of cards the owner began taking certain cards out of there slots and putting them back in different slots in the book.  He claimed that if my rarer cards were in the top of the booklet they had an increased chance of falling out and getting damaged.  I thought he was doing me a favor until I returned home and looked at the photos I took of the cards before going there.  It hindsight why would he take it upon himself to do this instead of just informing me.  He purchased two cards from me that were not in a booklet but in a fire proof box I had brought also.  Later, I was putting some of the photos online to sell when I noticed a card missing that had been in the photo but was now gone.  When I called to confront him he claimed he purchased the card.  My brother was there as a witness to the transaction and he claimed he only bought cards he didn't have and I only had two he could use.  When I questioned him not only did he say he had a bunch of that card but he got very angry and was screaming at me.  When I requested to see the surveillance tapes of that day he hung up.  I'm filing a report with the Mall today.  Although he claims it was only worth $1, the fact remains that he is a thief and not a person anyone should deal with.  "
852,2,"This is the worst and I don't believe it can be topped. On Aug 16, 2011 I took by bike to the dealer for repair. I dropped it going 23mph and accidently hit a curb on a turn. Anyway after various part backorders and other stories I got my repair completed and bike returned to me on Nov. 25; over 3 months I waited and the estimate was $6982.00. They told me when I left with bike the reason the neutral light did not work was a shifter sensor (on back-order)... I know more than they do when it comes to fixing a bike. When I paid these guys I got my bike back to the house and all my indicator lights were out and the wires were cut! I don't understand how a Victory dealer can operate this way. To get my N neutral light and the other lights to work I took the headlight off and spliced them back together. All is ok now and I will never take it back there. I feel lucky to have escaped! I would never step foot in this place! I purchased my Kingpin from them... no problem. When I returned to have it repaired it took 3 months. When I finally got the bike bike it was repaired badly. For example the wiring was broken and they actually thought it needed a sensor; all it needed was the wiring repaired. There were many other issues that would fill a book. Bottom line: very bad management and I do not believe the techs are certified. These are terrible things to say but my repair cost 7K and it was one of the worst experiences in my life. If I ever need anything for or done to my Victory it will not be done by Freedom Power Sports."
853,1,Out of the blue I get a call from this company asking me to purchase an ad on the back of the local school t-shirts. I was skeptical about the whole thing so I asked for some references. They said they would call me back with them. Never called i never received my shirts. So this company is a total rip off. Do not do business with them unless you want to throw your money down the drain.  
854,2,I went into the Play it again sports tonight and finally got service from the long hair pot head working the counter. I asked about used Kettlebells and I was then talked down to by the pot head in regards that they have never used bells in his 2 years working there. Then he told me to look on line for the auction sites. I thought I would just check and see if they had anything it is there name. I felt very insulted by the way a salesman would talk to a customer. I will not visit play it again sports ever.
855,2,"I had surgery on both of my feet and my doctor wrote me a note stating that I can not work out for an indefinite period of time due to the healing process and other complications that could occur especially with participating in boxing. X3 - cancellation department and location - are trying to tell me that I can cancel my contract but only if I pay the full termination fee. I can not help the fact that I am not able to hold up my end of the bargain and every other gym I have researched would let you out due to having a medical condition that prevents you from using the facility, the ones I checked are snap, LA Fitness and Golds Gym, I am sure mostly every other gym allows this. Also, I sent an email to X3 Sports on 1/10 and never once received a response back, I ended up having to go in there today to finally figure out what is going on - that's horrible customer service!"
856,1,These people are unbelievable with the way they talk to their customers. I called them to explain how I did not order 2 jerseys I only wanted one and the two they sent were both incorrect. The owner argued with me and told me that I was wrong and I had to eat the hundred and fifteen dollars I had spent and if I wanted it fixed I had to spend the money on buying a whole new one. I went to their site to order my dad a nice gift for Christmas and I was ripped off. Additionally I have never been treated so inconsiderately before so I defiantly would not use these people again.
857,1,"I purchased my car in the first week in September, week 2 in September I returned the car to Mr. Keith Johnson, and I told him that when I am driving  the Toyota that, it loss power when on the expresses way. which was very dangerous. I explained I didn’t want to kill anyone more did I want to get killed.my car was kept for 3 months, within those 3 months I had trouble contacting Mr. Johnson, One day I stop by the Dealership, my car looked as those it had been abended, (have pictures to show). there was mud up to the door am my tires were flat. Mr. Johnson called me apologizing saying they had to tow my car, out of mud. My car was given back to me in December. he told me that it was the battery and that they had fixed the problem. the car continued to have the same problem Mr. Keith Johnson and Prince has ignored all phone Calls.as of today my car had broken down completely and I am afraid that I may loss my job I have no transportation. This car should have never been sold to me are anyone else. and this car lot should have not sold this car. that’s not fair to me being a woman or anyone else.to be sold a car that does not work."
858,3,"I am seeking all the expenses for a 2005 BMW x5 4.4 from Darrin Grooms Auto Sports that I have had to pay for that should have been taken care of before they delivered me this vehicle on July 12th, 2012. I was aware that the navigation system did not work properly because I addressed that through pictures I saw before I purchased. I could tell something was wrong by the pictures online... They replaced the navigation system and pushed me towards a after market system after bringing it to BMW and confirming it was burnt out. I agreed to do the after market system but they never disclosed to me that would ruin the sound system and the built in sub-woofers would not work. I have to spend $149 for an amphiphile to get them to work, which i did with my Visa off amazon and was quoted $250.00 to get this installed. As soon as they installed the new amp the built in subwoofer shorted the amp out and it burned up The built in subwoofers DO NOT WORK. II still had to pay the guys $250 to wire the car for the amp and still have no sound I now purchased a aftermarket base tube that cost me $320 and waiting for that to arrive to get it installed. The actual built in bass speakers that fit the car about sling used for $450. When they installed the aftermarket sound system/ navigation and wired it in they broke the center console lights and shipped me the car with those hanging down and the clips broken off. I have Tape holding this up. The vehicle had not been detailed or cleaned what’s so ever. There were blood stains, carpets were stained everywhere, doghair filled the door storage compartments. Most importantly the right rear door has a big crack through it that the salesperson said was not there before they sold me the vehicle. I have pictures of all this and sent them to the salesperson. The vehicle was for sale for over 3 months at this dealership that I am aware of from checking auto trader randomly. They told me they didn’t have time to get the vehicle cleaned up before they shipped it to me. They priced the door out as did I and it is $2400 to replace the inside panel. I used my visa to detail the vehicle inside only for $65. I then had to bring the vehicle to a guy with special buffing compound to try to get all the oxidation off the plastic pieces around all the windows and used my Visa for $50. The ready windshield wiper blade was half hanging down from the vehicle and had to replace that as well $10..The salesperson verbally agreed to fill the vehicle in gas before they shipped it to me because the last vehicle I purchased from them, they sent dead empty. This one they also sent dead empty. i used my visa and filled it up for $89. While driving the vehicle, if you let go of the steering wheel it would rip you right off the road. The alignment was way off and the tires had not been rotated and had huge indentions assisting in pulling you off the road. Tires Plus in Boca Raton did the work and reported that this vehicle had not been properly serviced and will need new tires to correct the issue because those were ruined. I payed for a alignment with my Visa $131… I have repeatedly called the dealership since the vehicle got delivered on July 12th around 12:30pm. As soon as the vehicle came off the truck I made my first hone cal. I have called 12 times since and got the same answer that they were working on it and trying to get a hold of the owner and would call me back. They never called me back. The last time I called July 26 at 2:30pm and spoke with Jason the Sales manager he told me the owner is done with me and to go ahead and do what I have to do because they are to helping me with anything. The salesman Jacob and Sales manager Jason agreed that they were responsible for a lot of these issues and they should have never sent me the vehicle this way. Jacob also said that they never got to see the vehicle before it was shipped because it came right from the audio shop and on the truck. As a repeat customer and being very satisfied with my first purchase I was hoping for a better outcome and customer service with this one."
859,1,"We have been ripped off by Sunny Sports in California.  The 50cc scooter 2 wheels on the front had issues the first time it went on the road. Light bulb out, then running light out, then bearings fell a part (some missing, some only half a bearing was there; have photos), bracket broke (rusty metal - Photos) to hold fender up, then bracket broke in the same spot on the other side and they have never sent one, horn stopped working, back tire not on right, belt broke, discovered clutch parts were substandard and damaged.  Took scooter to shop to be fixed and found the steering parts were so bad they refused to have their staff take it for a test drive.  Parts do not come or they are damaged parts.  They force their customers to purchase 6 months of parts for a fee $69.99 and then do not send parts. Put us on hold and never return or they hang up the phone on us.  They say parts are shipped and then find out they never had them.  The owner of this company is Chinese so they say and he can't be reached because he speaks only Chinese.  They claim they never know what parts are being delivered from China until they arrive.  Since they know who we are now they won't return phone calls, answer emails, or return our money.  This scooter has only been on the road maybe 3 weeks and all this happened during the 3 weeks. STAY CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY!! They have cost us $3000."
860,3,"Purchased moped on-line via credit card.  Approx. one week after purchase, sales rep. (Terry) left a voicemail message to call back, but didn't mention what it was about. I tried to get in touch with him twice, on different days.  Customer service reps said, both times, He's not in.  I tried one more time to get a hold of him...same answer. So I complained to the customer service rep about him not returning my calls.  Shipping window was 10 to 15 days.  On day 14, I called to find out anything. He did call me back this time.  He said the communication problem was due to phone tag.  That was a lie.  He had my phone # and I have voicemail.   He said there was a problem getting the windshield for this moped and it would be an estimated 4 more weeks before I would receive the moped.  He then said it could be shipped, w/o windshield, next week and I would be reversed purchase $80 for no windshield.  So I agreed to that. And the rest of the sales end of it happened just that way. Thank you."
861,1,"We ordered our baseball uniforms from Sports 55 in December 2011.  On 2/8/12 we ordered another set of uniforms for some players we picked up.  Over a week later we noticed the team account had not been drafted for that order so we called Sports 55 back. They forgot to process our order but went ahead and did so supposedly while we were on the phone with the. It is now June and we still have no idea where these uniforms are! We have made numerous calls, emails and can never get an answer. We have asked to speak to the owner (John Ebrel) and of course he is never available to take a call. Even tried stopping payment on the order and can’t do it because the payment had been made over 60 days ago.  We were promised to have these uniforms in 4 to 6 weeks and we are going on 16 WEEKS and still don’t have the uniforms!! Called today and told the guy who answered, and he informed me to read the fine print on the website. Stated it could take up to 10 weeks but never once could tell me why the order I placed has been going on 16 weeks. Here we are with 1 tournament left in our season with no idea when we will see our uniforms from this business.  Throughout the year, we went to several tournaments and there were teams there with exactly the same complaints. Always told 4 to 6 weeks but never seen a uniform in that time frame...if at all!!! Never do business with these people. You can but they are going to take your money and u may or may not get the stuff you order!"

It never came. I called fed ex. and was told that nothing anywhere in there records showed any thing for my address.

863,1,"My husband ordered a trike from this company on May 18 and paid by electronic transfer (cash).  On Friday, June 8, 2012, he suffered 2 strokes.  He is not able to drive the trike due to the strokes. I called the company 2 days after this happened - they said the trike had not shipped.  I explained my story and was told to call back on Monday.  I called back  and was told to send an email to the customer service dept - there was nobody I could talk to.  The receptionist told me they would respond promptly.  After not hearing back, I called the net day and was told to talk to the manager Pat, who was aware of the situation and who had my paperwork on his desk.  After 3 calls to Pat, he finally got on the phone.  I explained what had happened and he told me since we did not pay by credit card he would not refund my money, but would give me store credit.  The trike cost $4700!  when I told him that it should have made no difference how I paid, they had my money regardless, he again said that in no way would he refund my money.  I asked to please speak to the owners and he told me it would be a very unpleasant conversation since I was trying to take money out of their pockets! He then began berating me for Alling over something so trivial as a trike! I again tried to explain that this was an extenuating medical circumstance - he finally said he would call the owners and would call me the net afternoon. Of course I have heard nothing from him.  My attorney allied him today and he picked up the phone and immediately hung it back up.  The receptionist would then not put any more calls through.  They took this situation and made it unbearable - that is a lot of money and I am outraged to have been treated so poorly by this company.  I am going to seek whatever legal actions I can afford to stop them from treating people this way.  They should be shut down."
864,1,"Please find below a pasted copy of the email I sent to this company. As you will see, the questions I asked were normal, legitimate questions anyone would ask when coming across the claim of a company willing to pay 5% per day. However, Mr. Williams apparently didn't think it was worth a response, even though I really was prepared to give this company thousands of dollars. When I went back to look that the site again a couple of days later (today), I found that his website home page has been down for more than 12 hours, even though the rest of the pages were still working when accessed directly. This made me suspicious enough to search for his name on Google, where I came across this previous post on this website from the man from Tennessee. Thank you, ripoffreport, for being here and saving me from getting ripped off! Regards, Rick (here is the email I sent, below:) Dear Mr. Paul J. Williams: As you can see from the email below, I wrote you a few days ago to ask you some questions that seem like pretty normal questions to me. I even told you that I am ready to open an account under the right set up circumstances. However, for some reason you are not answering your email. Additionally, now it seems that your home page is no longer online, although the rest of your site is still up of the URL to those other pages are directly typed into the computer. Since this all seemed like strange behavior for someone who purportedly wanted money from me, I did a Google search on you, personally, and came up with this result: ripoffreport.com/reports/ripoff184766.htm According to this submission, you took money from someone in Tennessee under the pretenses advertised and didn't bother to follow through with what your site says you will do. Is this true? Are you ever going to answer my emails, or the emails of the guy you allegedly ripped off? I don't know you at all, but what I am seeing so far is not real impressive. Please respond and let me know what is going on here. If this is nothing more than a scam, please have the character to just say so, and you'll never hear from me again. However, if this is legitimate, then I have to say that so far you are handling yourself in a very unprofessional manner. I suppose it's a good thing that you are not the only one involved in arbitrage listed on Google. Oh, well. NEXT! From: Rick Sent: Wednesday, April 12, 2006 1:02 PM To: 'admin@sportsarbitrageinvestor.com' Subject: Investor Questions Dear Sir: I am new to arbitrage, as I only heard of it through a friend a couple of days ago. From the way it was described, I am amazed that more people don't know about this if it's supposedly such a sure thing. If you will indulge me, I have a couple of questions I did not see on your website: Is it possible to lose money instead of earning the 5% you promise? If so, how is that possible? If it's not possible to lose money, how is that possible? I mean, it IS based on gambling, right? If it's not possible to lose money, why hasn't the world financial market jumped on board, totally redefining the way the world does business? Regarding the account you describe, is that an account that your company keeps for me, or are you merely referring to my E-Gold account? Also, is there a way to access and/or monitor the progress online through a website somehow on a real-time, daily basis? If I am some how ripped of in this process, how do I legally protect myself since I am not an English citizen in the (hopefully) unlikely event that you don't do what you say you will do? (I am an American who currently resides in the Philippines.) If you can answer these questions to my satisfaction, I will be happy to open an account immediately with your firm to see how this goes. Thanks in advance for taking the time to answer these questions questions that I am sure you probably answer all the time. I look forward to a long and prosperous future together."
865,3,"I had a friend who went to MM to purchase a motorcycle (Cr250) and the sales guys told him that they couldn’t finance the bike unless he put $1,000.00 down on it. Well my friend didn’t have the cash to do that so he told them it he didn’t want to do the deal. They proceeded on by telling him they could just say that he put the money down and everything would be taken care of. He didn’t go home with the bike that day but about a month later he gets a bill in the mail for the bike (his first months payment) He decides to call them and find out what’s going on since he didn’t even have the bike. They tell him that he needs to come pick it up since he bought it. So him and I drive down there and (By) the guy in charge in sales office looks over at us and says so your back to pick up the bike? and my friend tell him yeah sure... they By says well give us our money(the $1000.00) and take it, if you don’t have it get out of here I don't want to play Fucking games. so my friend and I walk out empty handed and confused. He never picked up the bike, He did receive a few more bills in the mail for it though. As a side note I have personally experienced bad customer service and heard many other horror story’s from the motorsports company’s."
866,2,"I bought a 4-wheeler in August of 2007. I took pictures of the damage of the damage. I sent them the pictures via the e-mail. Through numerous e-mails and I can't tell you how many phone calls. All I have ever gotten from them is excuses for not getting the damaged parts replaced. It is now May 18th. I actually went to the place to find out why my parts are not being taken care of. They actually tried to give me a part to fix the bike, it was as bad as the one I have. Then Carl the parts manager told me that he would have the parts at my home in two weeks. Guess what, two weeks went by and not parts. I called them and they would have to get back with my later that day. 4 hours later they did call me back. Shocked me! When I asked about my parts. He just told me more excuses as to why. I hung up on them, but not until I told them that I contacted the Kansas Attorney General. I am way past fed up with this business. They have no customer service. AT ALL !!"
867,1,"I contacted the sky dive place on 1/10/06 to schedule a dive for my father in law who is going to be 100 in Feb. He wanted to dive on Feb 18th in Greenville. I called and made reservations and he was charged $287.70 on his Mastercard. They called back the next day and said that the drop zone in Greenville was unavailable at that time and we would have to drive to Rome Ga, which is across the state (we are on the east side and it on the west). I told them I would like to have a refund and they said it was non-refundable because I didn't pay the extra $32.50 at the time of purchase. Well, who knows that they would want to cancel at time of purchase? I offered to pay the 32.50 at the time of the refund request and they said I could not. It is only available at the time of purchase. In the meantime I contacted Flying tigers of Clemson and told him of my dilemma. He said Oh No Not you too!. He told me that this company I paid WAS NOT a Skydiving company and that the reason we could not use the drop zone in Greenville is because it had closed in 2000. He told me to contact the US Para trooping Assoc. in Va. and report them which I did. The US Par. Assn. Told me to call the credit card company Immediately and deny those charges. AND to contact the The Atty Generals office and report it so I did. I contacted the credit card company again and they are going to send me paperwork to fill out. In the meantime, I made reservations with the Flying Tigers of Clemson for him to make his dive. They only accept cash at the time of the drop, just in case it rains etc. These people need to have their website pulled and made to refund all monies to the people that have NO IDEA of who they are dealing with until the credit card number is given them. If I have to, I will let my father in law press charges against me for using his number without his permission (which he did give me his card to do this with). I want to see them brought in to court upon charges of Fraud. If anyone else has had this same problem and received their refund, please let me know. Thanks."
868,1,"I have copied the letter I wrote to this company, it is below and has all the details of their scam. In a nutshell, we ordered a GO CART. When the Go Cart arrived it had incomplete instructions and missing parts. WE had professionals attempt to assemble it, this took TWO WEEKS at which they determined that it was a defective product and should be sent back. ALL NEW Sports will not except the product back citing that we had it beyond 7 days......They have a BUYSAFE guarantee which they will not UPHOLD!!!THEY BLOCKED his ability to email them. My child is devastated having waited years for the day that he would finally get a Go Cart and now that the day arrived, the Go cart is a piece of crap!!! We spent 2500.00 to find out that this company scams people! DON'T BUY FROM THESE SCAMMERS!!! Letter written August 31, 2007 to All New Sports, we purchase a Go Cart from you at the end of July 2007. My son was so excited and waited for the cart to arrive in excited suspense... We received the cart on August 10, 2007. I had a mechanic come to my home and attempt to assemble it. I called you that afternoon with a complaint. 1. The instructions were absolutely the most ridiculous instructions and completely no help. 2. There seems to be missing hardware. Your customer service rep was very rude and insisted that I am not mechanically inclined. He stated that, Your company suggests that all their customers take the carts to professionals to assemble them. He also stated that the directions are Chinese American and always come that way... everyone has a problem with them. He said then instructed me to call technical support and hung up on me. My questions to you are: 1. If you insist that you customers take the carts to professionals, how much time do you think it would take to have the professionals assemble them? They usually can not stop what they are doing just for your cart, they do have other business to attend too... It does take time to get it to and from the professionals as well... Do you really think a week is enough time for this???? 2. If YOU KNOW everyone has a problem with your instructions, why do you keep sending them out???? Why do you not add extra time onto your return policy if you know the instructions are a joke?? 3. Why are your people so rude to customers? I did as your customer service rep instructed and I called Technical support who informed me that they would research the directions and email us a copy. We waited over 24 hours and did not hear back from them. On Saturday, the 11th, I called back your customer support and complained again. This time I was told to call back Technical support and that they will walk us through the assembly. We had another mechanic over (now there are TWO working on this cart) and called back Tech support. Your tech support asked my mechanic to hold the line and NEVER came back onto the phone!! After three days of working on this cart, my two mechanics gave up and suggested that we ship it to a shop that specializes in rebuilding, modifying and problem Carts. My son was devastated with the time that he had to wait. He can see the cart but he can't touch it, it was crushing him with each passing day. We had to book an appointment for this specialty mechanic. It took us 4 days until we could get in. The cart was shipped over to them and was in their care for over a week. Finally they called and told us that they had worked consistently on the cart, and they still cannot get it up and running. They stated that there are so many problems with it and it must be returned. They backed this statement in writing. Again my son was devastated... now the cart will never work??? Now he has to wait for this one to be sent back and a new one to arrive?? My husband called your company and then followed up with an email. He explained the issues with the cart and the fact that we need to return it, as we have exhausted every other possibility. Your response was that we had it over the 7 day limit and then you BLOCKED HIS EMAIL ADDRESS!!! (email attached) What kind of company does that??? Definitely not a reputable one!!! The entire time we had this cart it has been in the assembly stage, it has never been run and CAN'T EVER BE....We literal did everything in our power to fix this cart and it can not be......It must be returned and we will fight you for this rip off if you do not comply with YOUR PROMISES FOR A SAFE TRANSACTION. I am writing to BUYSAFE, BBB and RIPOFF REPORT.COM. I have PHONE RECORDS, and MECHANIC's RECORDS to back us....we will not stop until you make the arrangements for this cart to be picked up and refund our money back...It is so obvious that you have a 7 day return policy because you know that it will take over 7 days until your customers find out that your Carts are a rip off and by then, it is too late, according to YOU, to return them. Is that why your all NEW sports???? It is businesses like yours which make Internet transactions unsafe. Can't you find a way to make money LEGIMATELY?? Don't you realize it is little children that are getting the raw end of your unethical business transactions???? If you would have cooperated and backed your promises, we would have exchanged the Go Cart with one that actually worked but instead you were rude, underhanded and unethical. Christina, Letter from My husband, Dear Jeff I'm not satisfied with your product period. I will return it as never used. The agreement for warranty and the return policy were just received on August 20th asking me to sign and return. Why would you send me this document if I had already agreed? As for the 7 day return policy the product was not received until August 10th. Assembly was conducted immediately following and your customer service department was notified of the issues. In fact your office attempted to give instructions over the phone and I might add were perceived as rude and reluctantly cooperative. Once again, I am requesting you accept this return for a full reimbursement. The product will be prepared for shipping by Friday, August 24th. Once again I am requesting that you honor this return. The integrity of All New Sports as well as ethical business practice is what is in question. I look forward to your cooperation in this matter. "
869,2,"We were at Sports Authority and needed heavy socks for boots. I found three identical pair of socks in a clearance bin but only one of the packages were marked as $4.97, regular price was $12.99. When we went to check out, all of the socks rang up at $13.99 ($1.00 more than the regular price tag) and the cashier refused to adjust the price and suggested that we or someone else must have put the clearance tag on the one pair. I was of course furious and very embarrassed at her accusation. She called a manager who also refused to alter the price, then the store manager(Jim) suggested that someone put the socks in the bin and one of the clearance tags had been put on the socks, then also refused to alter the price on the two pair that didn't have clearance price tags on them, even though the three were identical! I'm really frustrated about this because anywhere you go, the retailer will adjust prices if there is a mistake, obviously Sports Authority doesn't care about being fair to their customers. I'm waiting to hear from their district manager at this point."
870,1,Ordered a pair of hockey skates. Credit card was charged immediately during the order process! (this was already a bad sign.) Aret Carlson sends me an email informing me item is on backorder and will not ship for three weeks! I promptly respond asking for a shipping address change since I was not expecting such a long delivery time. Get no response. Two weeks later send another email to customer service asking for order status. No response. Phone number is disconnected. On the promised shipped date I send another email asking for shipping confirmation and tracking number. No response. I did some research and found that they have an unsatisfactory rating with their local BBB. Three weeks later still no response and no hockey skates. Phone number still disconnected. Called credit card company which is now investigating. Don't do business with this company.
871,1,"On April 5, 2007, we complained to their accounts department regarding a change on my husband's account - renewing automatically his membership after his one-year contract expired - $599.00 for a year - and all of a sudden our VISA was charged $83.74. Stephanie at accounting filed up a request for refund form, indicating that the refund would be processed in 30 -60 days. I spoke to Stephanie, after leaving several messages were that went unreturned, who told me her supervisor did not approved the request. During our meeting in April she never indicated that the request needed to be approved, nor did anyone ever notified of this refusal to return our money. According to the consumer protection act they needed to provide my husband with a registered letter or a hand delivered letter requesting his signature before any further transactions were made, since he paid for a year in advanced and his membership expired, thus making the contract void. I have requested a copy of the above documents (i.e., letters with my husband's signature) and I was told that the contract overrode the consumer protection act and this was not required. Under present legislation, this is fraud, so I would like to make other consumers aware of it."
872,1,"National Sports Services is posting false ads on the internet. Many times, they are stating under the pictures of their employee or after you click on the purchase now button; If this game doesn't win, you receive his picks for the rest of the week for FREE. Or: If my GUARANTEED winner doesn't win, you will receive my picks for the rest of the month for FREE. If one of their games loses, they do not e-mail the customer with his, or her, free pick the following day. They do not telephone the customer and give him, or her, their free pick the next day. Therefore, the customer who purchased National Sports Services supposed winner is the one who has to make contact with National Sports Service the next day. By having the customer initiate the contact. National Sports Services is able to make it appear as if the customer is contacting them to make a purchase. This couldn't be further from the truth. Once the consumer initiates the contact, National Sports Services has the opportunity to start using selling pressure on the consumer. This also gives them the opportunity to make it appear as if you are getting a deal that is too good to be true. National Sports Services got the opportunity to tell me that Dave Cokin has inside information on games that other people don't have. Yeah. Right. And, if you buy his season package, you will get his over/under picks for the rest of the baseball season. Some people have to pay $1,000 just to get Dave's over/under pick in one game! Yeah. Sure! Then they get you to give them your credit card numbers. If you don't have enough credit available, National Sports Services starts asking questions like: Don't you have another credit card we could use? Don't you have a savings account? Where is your money? Is your money in stocks? Meanwhile, National Sports Services is getting away with FALSE ADVERTISING. Did National Sports Services give me my free pick on June 19th as promised? Only after they charged around $26,000 to my credit cards. You call that FREE? I made purchases at National Sports Services of $29 on June 8th, $15 on June 13th, $25 on June 15th and $25 on June 18th. The June 13th and 15th purchases were guaranteed winners. They won. Therefore, I didn't have to call National Sports Services on the following days. However, Dave Cokin's June 18th GUARANTEED winner, LOST! Why would I want to spend $40,000 at National Sports Services On June 19th and 20th, the 2 days following a Dave Cokin LOSER? I didn't spend anything the 2 days that followed Dave Cokin wins. (June 14th and June 16th) This all was a result of SALES PRESSURE. If these guys are not crooks, how come they have to state 3 times on the bottom of their contract: We are freeing them from any claims whatsoever. And, all money is non-refundable. Football Season doesn't even start until August 1st! I paid $20,000 for their football season picks because of their SALES PRESSURE. What does football season have to do with the FREE baseball games that they promised in their June 18th ad? "
873,1,I called to cancel card and their automated services takes you in circles until it says it doesn't recognize your response. Over and over I tried different things until finally I got a person on the phone and they sent me a check for the 130 minus the monthly fee for the card I had less than 24 hrs. They said it be 2 weeks on Sept. 8. On Oct 1 I called again and they sent my money to a different state altogether. So still waiting... Never again will I use this brand or product. And I urge everyone to save their money and their time. GREENDOT is a joke and SCAM artists.
874,1,Going through a same ripoff scam as described above.  Mine was with Colleyville Heritage High School with an actual athletic coach named James Bostic who had no knowledge that his name was being referred.  Very unethical fraud.  Will take this matter legally.
875,2,"I submitted the following review regarding a Lodge 6 Quart Dutch Oven purchased online from Academy. I was cool with the result of the deal until they rejected my online review for not fitting their undefined posting requirements. Apparently they screen out all negative comments, which stinks to high heaven. Ordered one as a present for my wife for Christmas, and had it shipped. The over packing was astounding, roughly the side of a small refrigerator. The box inside looked fine, so I just wrapped it and all was well, until it was opened. Much of the enamel had been chipped off during shipping, and it was still flaking off, rendering it les than useless. We returned and exchanged it at a nearby store and noticed all of the nice packing in the second one that was not present in the first. Love the product and the price was great, but it was a royal pain to get a good one. Definitely will never ask for anything to be shipped from Academy again, and the trip to replace it has left a permanent stain on any repeat efforts."
876,1,"When you come in the front of this sports bar, you are thinking you can watch sports enjoy your food and drink, but if you really care about your health, go in there on any given day you may see the food in boxes on the floor, dishes sitting in cold water, or even worse see the prep cooks with no hair nets, and no gloves being worn while your food is being prepared. if you see the 3-dish sink it leaks more than a strainer! And only one faucet that works! And also look in the coolers and it might you re-think what you choose to eat, there are no slip mats so watch your step the floors are always. Oily and slippery, and the owner gives more reasons as to why it hasn't been fixed than fixing them. The only thing he cares about is how much he makes on weekend sales, and he underplays everybody except himself, his wife and the chef everyone else gets a little above min. Wage. And some of the foods are not fully cooked and the chef may come out and tell you how the food should be cooked but won't pay for it."
877,1, I ordered two off road vehicles for my kids for Christmas. I ordered a 50 cc Dirt Bike and a 50 cc ATV. What I got was a damaged 90cc Dirt Bike and a 110 cc ATV. Since they were presents I did not try to use them till after Christmas. The ATV would not start. They told me to jump with car. It still would not start. they told me to call manufacture TaoTao. The guy dave told me to thank them they voided my warranty. They told me to take to machine shop I did. The guy was less than thrilled to work on it. He could not get it to work either. I contacted BBB State Attorney General still waiting. I do not recomend buying from these guys the are not helpful. The product does not work it should be replaced. Not to mention neiter is what I paid for. I would live with dirt bike being to big but now my kids can’t ride anything. 
878,1,"They claim they have a double money back guarantee if they do not show you a profit. Well with exact records and showing they were not even close to a profit, I got sent through hoops and still never received anything. After sending about 5 e-mails, there was not a reply until i did a money dispute through PayPal. Then they call back and want to talk, ask me to mail something to another department and yet only one person answered the phone when they did answer. Their manager is suppose to be Toni, but he couldn't tell me anything. After mailing, e-mailing and calling, there was very delayed replies and i have not seen a penny back. I highly recommend staying away from this company period. They are not even a 45% winner. Stay away from John Fina and winning way sports."
879,2,"I placed an order online with Road Runner Sports a couple days with my VIP account and utilized a VIP discount code. Today, when I checked my bank statement, I noticed an unauthorized charge of $20 from Road Runner Sports. Upon contacting them, I was informed that my VIP membership had expired at in 2011; they could not explain why my VIP status was still active on the website. Rather than call to inform me of this or cancel my order, they opted to make an unauthorized charge to my credit card. For the record, Road Runner made an unauthorized charge to my credit card in 2011 as well, which is why I had not shopped with them since. After two unauthorized charges to my card, I won't be shopping there again."
880,1," Grant sports global will contact you for sports investing. They claim that their information on games are so solid that you are not gambling on games. They have different levels of packages to pay for this information on sports. They then keep in contact with you on which games to move money on but when you ask what the inside information is they will not give that out. If you pay for the information you should get it. They will want an upfront payment for sports picks and will guarantee that you win. If you win they want a percentage but if you lose you will never hear from them. Be careful with this company, they will make it sound like you will make tons of money with virtually no risk. When i asked the representative if the company is so good then why is he working for them and not using their service. He responds with i get the information for free while working for the company, that is the perk, but he's also says he's been there for 20 years. If the information was that good he would be retired in 5 years. I did a $100 trial week and didn’t get any games. The next week when I called them on it they said to wait till the weekend. I finally got a pick and it lost. If you talk to them you will find out much more. I cant write everything. This is just a warning."
881,1,"I placed an online order for a 3-piece wooden out door play set for my kids on the 22 of April 2014. In less then an hour of me placing my order I received a phone call telling me it would cost an additional $400 to ship my items and that they need a checking number, I did not like this but paid it. This brought my total to $1599. Three weeks later I still have not received a tracking number so I called to find out why, and after being hung up on 4 times, I ask if I would just cancel my order and was told i could send an email to customer service and request to do so. I did an 4 days later have still heard nothing. I have my receipt from my purchases they removed the money from my account and I have received no products what so ever, and every time I call they hang up on me or tell me my order has been shipped an I should get an email soon with a tracking number. Than it is taking so long because my order is being shipped to Arkansas from California. This Company is a rip off!!! I have lost $1599 That I saved for over 2 years to buy my 3 kids a nice play set and got screwed! DONT BUY ANY THING FROM THEM!!! "
882,1,Bought a coupon for 2 people for a balloon ride and now no one will honor them and I can't seem to get anyone on the phone to discuss the problem.  Bad thing for them is in my line of work there troubles are only about to start.  My advice to everyone is don't do business with this rip off company.
883,1,I bought a go-cart from Great Sports Inc. It arrived with a defective carburetor. They had Promised me that it would arrive in time for my grandson's birthday---which it did. But the defective carburetor wouldn't allow it to run. They promised to have a new carburetor sent to me in plenty of time to replace it prior to my grandson's birthday. His party and birthday have since come and gone and I have still not received the New Carburetor!!!!!:( Very Poor Customer Service From These People. I would NOT recommend them to anyone.
884,1,"My Sports Dreams aka Reaching Our Goal is a scam. A total rip off. They trick you with promises of easy no risk fundraising for sports teams. Then they prepare childish and tacky brochures they send out to your teams’ friends and family. They solicit donations. The donations are then withheld from you for months, if not years. They say all sorts of BS about how YOU didn’t follow their rules, so you must pay them. They will send your account to collections. They basically con you into giving them your friends and families address, then they keep the donations those people intended for the loved one on the sports team. If you get any finds, they will be a quarter of what the families donated to you, and it will be months and months late. This company also has an extremely high employee turnover rate. They are frauds all around. I recently tried to find an address- turns out they closed that location and are operating out of a PO box now. FISHY! They also keep changing the name of their company. Do yourself a favor- ask for donations yourself- without the cheesy and immature letters. You can easily set up a PayPal account and accept your own donations that way. Steer clear of this disgusting scam."
885,1,"The owners of this place are crooks. They recently repro’d our truck after we were half-way paid off. They looked for any and every reason to repo it for months and would take it for whatever reasons (missed payments though we always got caught up or close) then make us pay a lump sum to get it back. UNTIL they'd made over half on it, in which point they took the truck to sell it to some other poor sap. The truck has several things wrong with it, that happened almost immediately after we got it but we're not the type of people to complain so we didn't bother. But it is obvious, especially with the previous CONVICTIONS (including money laundering and sexual exploitation of a minor, in the case of Chris Drosopoulos), that he and his co-owners are not the upstanding citizens they pretend to be. CONSENT DECREE OF FORFEITURE as set forth: Claimants Chris Drosopoulos, and Effie Drosopoulos, on behalf of Chris Drosopoulos, shall forfeit $700,000.00 in U.S. currency in lieu of forfeiture of said real property. Signed by Judge Jimm Larry Hendren on April 4, 2007. (mfr) as seen, he was previously convicted for sexual exploitation of a minor during the seizure listed above. It is no surprise to me that they are despicable with the way they treat their customers and their money. Will never spend another dime there and I hope others will heed my words."
886,1,"After purchasing two large items from Sports Authority; elliptical and bicycle, two reward cards were mailed to my home. These cards were mailed separately (within two to three weeks of each other). When attempting to use the second reward card which was mailed to my home, the cashier stated it could not be used as it was previously obtained. Completely confused since I had the card in my possession how was it possible that I used it? The cashier had no idea how to handle the situation and asked assistance from the manager who looked like she couldn’t be bothered. She rudely told me I had to call customer service, which already in the store, wasting over a half hour of my time, I told her No, you can call. The individual on the phone, Lauren, was absolutely ridiculous. She explained that sometimes duplicate rewards are issued and Unfortunately the amount could not be obtained over and over again. Please tell me how this makes sense? Why would a company send out multiple reward cards if it can only be used once? If you send me two cards, I am going to use those two cards. The reward amount was a lousy $26 dollars, but why not use it if you have it. Lauren was no help and supposedly the manager Katie was on her lunch break. I asked if there was any other manager and she said No. It seems really impossible that a large business as Sports Authority only has one manager in office. When calling later that day, I was told by another representative (Sean) that the manager had left for the day. Seems to me there is no manager and they are basically giving you the run around in hopes of you giving up. I have emailed my concern to many email addresses found online and have received no response. It is extremely frustrating after spending hundreds of dollars on an elliptical and bicycle, to which they pretend to have a reward system that you are unable to obtain. I would have rather received no reward card, which would have saved my sanity and time wasted at the store and on the telephone with their customer service. Bottom line: I will never shop in Sports Authority again and I hope that you do not either. This place is overpriced with employees who are poorly trained with upper management which cannot make decisions. Hopefully I will receive a response and will continue to leave my complaint on every single Complaint Website I can find."
887,2,"Decided to try flying with Frontier Airlines for my first time and it will be my last time - if I ever get back home. Frontier flights were being delayed and cancelled left and right in the terminal. They were having people switch gates as well. Waiting 5 hours with delay after delay to say our flight was cancelled. No voucher offered, no hotel compensation, no apologies, no explanation at all, except to rebook our flight for the next day. Frontier had one person to try and respond to over 100 people with no supervisors to assist. This did not only happen to my flight, but was happening to the majority of Frontier Airlines flights in my terminal. The terminal started off with a few people and ended up with a terminal (overflow) of irate passengers. I was told I cannot get reimburse for my hotel stay after Frontier cancelled my flight. Very frustrating experience. Never again."
888,1,"My daughter wanted nothing more than a Hot Air Balloon Ride for her 21st birthday on April 29, 2012.  In researching on the internet I found a site selling Hot Air Balloon Rides in upstate New York Hudson Valley near my daughters college.  Then there was a pop up advertising another option with a phone number to call offering a Hot Air Balloon Ride special.  I called the number and the sales person told me they booked for the other site I was looking at as well and that they had sites in a town near the college where my daughter could book a ride. I purchased the certificates with my Visa card over the phone - they sounded legit and professional - and received a confirmation and the certificates via email which I downloaded and printed for my daughter and her friend. I was traveling abroad when my daughter called me to say that she could not reach anyone at the number to book her ride and that the number had been disconnected.  When she looked up the other name on the certificate as 1-800-skyride she found all this information about what a scam it was and all the testimony from people who could not get refunds when they were unable to reach the customer service line. I was so embarrassed and angry - the certificates had cost me over $400 dollars and left me looking like a fool in the eyes of my daughter.  I want my money back.  To this day I am hoping to find a way to reverse payment on this charge, join a class action suit or somehow get restoration for this fraud.  It does help to know that others have similar stories but it's cold comfort.  The realization that I may never recover this money still makes me feel sick.  I will never purchase anything by phone from an internet source again, that's for sure, but I can't believe this company has not been prosecuted. "
889,1,"I ordered a pair of seat warmers for my car.  When they arrived, there was no way that I could get them to fit, so I contacted the company for an RMA (return merchandise authorization). After going back and forth with them for a month, they finally provided me with an RMA.  After they received the seat warmers back, it took them another month before they provided me with a credit, which was $15 less than what I paid.  Then, I finally found something that I could use, and provided them with the authorization code, they wouldn't honor the authorization code because they claimed it is past the time they honor credits.  I told them that they never provided me with an expiration...they stopped emailing me. I will never buy another product from these people and, in addition to filing this claim on the Ripoff Report, I will be posting on my Facebook and Twitter accounts what a crappy company Sports Imports, LTD is!"
890,1,"I would highly not recommend doing business with Galactic Snow Sports.  I ordered a pair of ski boots in early April online.  They were to small so I wanted to return them.  Tried many times to contact them. No one picks up the phone.  No one responds to the emails. The 800 number went out of business. I called UPS to find out if they were still in business -- they indicated they were. So on faith I returned the boots via UPS, thinking if they were out of business -- the boots would be returned to me in any event. They were delivered on May 8 and signed for by Burger.  No credit was issued and again no one picks up the phone -- no response to messages.  Now I notice that there website says that they are closed for summer inventory."
891,1,"My wife and I purchased a 2009 Scion TC. Basically a Toyota corolla under the Hood.  At first we where very happy. We had FREE oil changes for life. So we took full advantage of this.  Every time it was time to change the oil, we where there getting it changed.  We only missed ONE due to the service department under construction. We purchased the extended warranty 100k miles or 4 years I believe. At about 96k miles the motor throws a rod.  Mind you, we NEVER missed an oil change. When they where closed I changed it myself.  Well, I take it in to get the warranty work done. After a month of fighting tooth and nail with Sports City and Onyx, I finally got the engine replaced By warranty.  Webbing a trusting person, I was told the warranty on the NEW motor was one year unlimited miles.  Word of advice.  NEVER just take someone's word. Higher it in writing.  Well after driving about 7 thousand miles and 2 oil changes later , the motor starts knocking   I immediately pulled over and had the car toward to Sports City. I was not going to cause any further damage if any had been done.  I go to talk to the service advisor and we discovered it was about to throw a rod again. Not even 10 thousand miles after the last motor swap. Ok I was confident that warranty was going to cover the motor swap. I mean they have documented proof we never missed an oil change. Now, because SOME CHEAP BUTT at Sports City wanted to save money, apparently the last motor swap, they replaced with a motor that had 60 k miles already and was also told that there was no 1 year warranty like I was told.  Instead it was an EOT warranty (End of Term). Basically end of original extended warranty.  Why earth would you warranty a motor for only 6 thousand miles??  Ok back on topic. After a lot of sleep less nights and fighting back and forth, my wife and I where told we are just SOL. Nothing they can Do.  They aren't replacing under warranty. So we traded it in on a New Ford Edge. We will NEVER EVER buy another Toyota again.  I hope I made sense. A lot of info to fit in there.  Oh and coincidentally the lady that told us about the year warranty on the supposed NEW motor no longer works there. So PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY from Sports City Toyota. I have list so much sleep and hair because of this very stressing issue. Thanks y'all.  Have a good one."
892,3,"I am disabled and was needing a hot tub. I found this website on line, and decided to check them out. I called them and discussed their 4 men hot tub for $589.95, the inflatable kind. So of course I bought it and then it was delivered. Then 2 months later I noticed that we were having an issue with it. It was beeping, so we shut it off and reset it to start again, but we also called the company about the problem we were having with it. They told us to let them know if it continues to do this to call them back. Which we did that many times, and they Still told us to shut it off and push the rest button, so we did this for many months. Then when we called them back about the problem Still beeping, they then told us that they were getting many other calls about this problem with their hot tub. They said that they would fix the problem or replace it, by sending us out a new one, and all we would do is box up the old one and send it back. We waited and waited and heard nothing from them. We called them back and asked them when will we be getting our new one since the reset button no longer works."
893,3,"I had to fly to Colorado for a funeral due to my grandmother passing. I bought 2 tickets round trip for myself and my spouse. I went directly through the airlines website. I purchased the tickets along with upgraded package to allow baggage. Flight out to Colorado no problems. Coming home 9/28 our flight was scheduled to leave at 7:10 am... We boarded on time but then were asked to deplane a while later. They told us there was an electrical issue... The flight was then delayed 5 1/2 hours...which we were supposed to have a connection in Chicago and then on to Jax.
We were told when deplaning in Chicago that they were not sure if we were going to be on the same plane due to the fact that it was the exact same plane that was down because of earlier electrical issues. We went to restroom and when we came out accidentally turned the wrong way and had to go through security again... (The terminal we were in only had 1 gate) Was told earlier this was an old non used section of the airport...not sure why but who knows... Ok no prob. We went through to security.
Then the TSA agent told us we needed a gate pass due to the airlines not putting Chicago to Jax on our tickets??? So we sprinted to desk. They printed and security let us right up front. This total transaction was literally 10 mins. When we got back to the gate there was no one at the desk but plane was there. We tried to find someone but no luck. Remember this was a 1 gate terminal. Finally after another 10 mins an agent came off the plane... And then she refused to let us on...she stated she has already had to work 5 and a half hours over her shift ends...same time as flight delay. We explain we have our carry one on board with wallet included. She stated it was not her problem. And got her stuff and left.
We waited at the gate another 20-30 mins in hopes someone would come by. The plane was still there the entire time. Finally we went to ticketing and they said there was nothing they could do. Why didn't they call desk agent in the beginning to let them know we had to get gate passes is beyond me. Long story short they told us the best they could do is get us on a flight 2 days later... what!!! Then how are we going to get our carry ons back. After having to pay out of pocket for new tickets and having to have the bank help us with temp. CC... the only luck we had was our IDs were in our pocket. They promised refund. Went online to check...guess what? Only a partial refund??? And when checking that THIS IS THE kicker. They charged my card 2 times for the whole flight. So now I'm out over 1500.00 and still no resolution???"
894,3,I bought a cart from Safer Wholesale in June total price $2900 they cashed the check but did not send the cart until last Thursday.  After it was uncrated and seats and wheels were put on it wpold not start we called them and they told us to use starting fluide finally found that the fuel lines were not hooked up correctly after fixing that and purchasing a new filter we finally got it started and it will run until you take your foot off the gas and it dies.  When you purchase a new vehicle you expect it to run I am 84 years old caring for me son who has had a stroke and cannot walk far and he needs the cart.  The compant will not send anyone to fix it and will not refund our money we need help badly. 
895,1,"I placed an order with Sports55.com on April 18, 2013 for a 16U boys travel baseball team.  Our season runs from May 24 to August 1.  When I placed the order I was notified that it would be 5-6 weeks estimated delivery and production began on 4/18.  No other information was provided. After 5 weeks I had heard no update, so I contacted them.  Fully expecting to hear that my uniforms were shipping within in the next few days.  What I received back was a total lack of any details.  It's our busiest season  Production has not provided me with a date for completion.  I asked if we could possibly get expedited shipment and was told they would look into it and get back to me.  (follow up from Sports 55 never happened). After 7 weeks I contacted them again and received exactly the same response.  It's our busiest season  Production has not provided me with a date for completion.  They did add in Not sure why you are asking us for this information.  We will tell you when they are in shipping and until then we have not further updates.   After 8 weeks, they did tell me that my uniforms would be shipping the following week.  That continued each week. I contacted them each week and received similar lack of concern responses.  After 10 weeks I placed a phone calls and was told It seems that you are just calling in because you didn't like the response you were given on delivery.  You have all the information you need and you will be notified when product is ready to ship.  Absolutely refused to refund money, refused to allow me to talk to higher management, and refused any lack of concern. I contacted them again after 11 weeks and asked again to speak with owner.  They offered to let me speak to the same customer service rep who has been so unhelpful for the past 11 weeks.  It was a total inconvenience for them to even talk with me.  They refused to connect me with the owner. After 12 weeks we did receive jerseys.  It's now 14 weeks and we still do not have hats. This company should absolutely be put in jail.  They are stealing from kids and have no remorse for doing so. We tried to give the boys some really nice uniforms & matching hats to for this season.  The result is they played the entire summer hoping to receive them, but wearing temporary jerseys and hats.       "
896,3,"They say that they would print up poster-size football schedules for the local university, and I could buy an advertising space on these schedules. For my money I would receive a couple dozen that I could pass out, and around 2500 would be distributed to the local sports bars, banks, and realty offices in July of this year. What I received was a half-dozen proofs with a typo. No evidence that any were ever distributed, and their promises of sending me a few corrected schedules to pass out are just empty promises. I call, and get voice mail or if I can talk to a person; more excuses and more empty promises. This is now the end of August."
897,1,"I booked this place for my wedding so that my husband and I could leave in a helicopter. $700 to transport us to a hotel an hour away. I paid the balance in full 1 year prior to the wedding. The local pilot (who is an independent vendor HIRED by this company) was all ready to go, when a HUGE storm rolled in that caused a government-issued temporary ban on air traffic the day of my wedding. Needless to say, as accommodating as the local pilot wanted to be, he was legally not allowed to fly that day. I had to scramble for a last minute good Samaritan at the wedding to drive my husband and I to the coast that night. When I called back to ask for a refund given the situation, I was denied. Then a month later I was informed that I was approved. Then that was denied by the magical corporate fairies (who NOBODY there seems to know the name of.) This company gave me the runaround for the past 6 months now. Do NOT book with them. Run the other way if you don't want to get cheated!"
898,1,"I cannot directly blame the dealership International Motor Sport for the actions of this weasel because I never dealt with anyone else but Robert B... I don't know to what extent the dealership was involved in this matter but I do know that Robert B did rep for this dealership. This clown car salesman Robert B promised to make repairs to a car before he sold it to me. The car ran good during  the test drive but the check engine light was on. This guy promised to repair the problem associated with the CEL. When I bought the car the CEL was off and he said he had it repaired. A couple days later I noticed that whenever I start the car all the dash board light indicators came on except the CEL, I got suspicious. I took the car to the shop and they confirmed my suspicion. This shady SOB did not repair the car as promised; but he did in fact rip the LED out for the CEL. When I called him about it he tried to act like he was shocked that his mechanic would do such a thing, I know this clown was behind the scheme. He was hoping I would never catch this slimy move he made. This POS gives honest dealers a really bad name. His dealership eventually coughed up only half of the repair cost so I would go away. Warning to all, Stay clear from Robert Bilovesick and his associates, THEY ARE BAD NEWS."
899,2,Terrible service along with false information and false advertising. Before Christmas I went online and found they were having some items 70% to 50% off. I selected a product called powerpro and the picture showed a 1500 spool $44.95. When I put the item in the cart it said it was 300 yards rather than 1500 showed in the picture. I called the Expert Line and was assured the cart description was wrong and in fact it is 1500 yards. I went ahead and ordered the product as a gift and when it arrived it was only 300 yards. I've left 2 complaints online with no comment from Management. They tried to clean-up the wed page by putting a big banner saying 300 yards but now everything you click on says it even when its a 150-yard item. I understand this company has not made a profit in almost a decade and I can see why. I thought I had some respect for this company but failure to respond to customers is going to push them out of business. Im giving them 2 stars when they have earned nothing but a lost customer.
900,1,"Purchased a brand new scooter, was missing pieces. Strung along, promised a part, and lied to for over a month. We purchased a TaoTao ATM50-A1 model scooter. It arrived in decent time - roughly 10 days. After assembling, it was discovered there was a piece missing. A 6 month parts warranty was included, so we contacted the company via email - as there was no answer via phone. After no response for over a week - we opened a charge back with our bank, as we had a $700 product that was as useful as a paperweight. After opening the charge back, we were reached within 24 hours! The only way they agreed to help out was if we closed the charge back out -- with much hesitation, we did. From there, the responses of Chris M, were sporadic in response time anywhere from right away to days at a time. After waiting over a month - I contacted Tao Tao corporate in California - and after a bit of research on Tao Tao's end, the parts guy came back stating that the company was out of business and NOT an authorized dealer. Thank you to Josh at Tao Tao Inc in California for being so prompt and getting the missing part(s) out to us along with the missing registration papers. Proven Power Sports is not a reputable business, with HORRIBLE customer service and business ethic. "
901,1,"I purchased this Maytag Bravos XL Washing Machine at Lowe's in California, MD for about $800 on April 8, 2018. What a disappointment for a Made in America product! BUYER BEWARE - DO NOT BUY! I agree 100% with the reviews and comments. This washing machine is a ""PIECE OF JUNK""! It does not clean clothes! It does not provide enough water to get all clothes wet! All it does is shake the clothes back and forth and stays in the same order you put the clothes in. I agree with one of the reviews that ""it does nothing but crumple/wad the middle items together and rub them"". And the clothes are DIRTY!! I will be calling Maytag 1-800-344-1274 and demand for my money back!! Lowe's should STOP selling this product!"
902,2,"DON'T BUY! We purchased the Maytag Bravos CMT about 3 years ago. After using it I was thoroughly disappointed in the HE technology as it used almost no water. I found that the Bulky Sheets cycle at least filled the tub 2/3 of the way so I started using it for everything. Unfortunately the machine has gone through 3 impellers at close to $100 ea. and now it has stopped washing once again. This will make the 4th impeller I've had to order bringing my total to almost $400 out of pocket after my initial purchase of $700. That's great Maytag, I've wasted $1,100 on a piece of junk you're responsible for manufacturing. Never again! DON'T BUY!"
903,2,"I purchased my desktop computer at Best Buy in May 2015 and have been paying for Geek Squad every year. I called them today because I have been having trouble connecting to the internet with this computer for 2 months and it's getting worse. For example, I was trying to use Google today and kept getting messages that there was no internet connection. I called my internet provider and after running a few tests, and the fact that all our other devices in the same room have no trouble connecting, I was told the problem is with the computer.
I called Geek Squad and was informed the only way they can check it is if I return it to Best Buy (which is a 30+ minute drive from my house each way) or pay $49.95 for someone to come to the house (which I refuse to pay since I pay them an annual fee to take care of my computer). I have called with problems before and they did everything remotely at no cost to me but I was told that they can't do anything remotely this time. It's amazing that my internet provider was able to run tests remotely, but not the Geek Squad. Unfortunately, I just renewed my membership 2 months ago but will not waste my money again."
904,3,"I dropped off a computer to have repairs and was told it would take two weeks. After not hearing anything from Geek Squad after two weeks, I called to check in. Customer service said that the repair center was waiting for a part and that they had no idea when I would have my computer back. I registered my displeasure at the lack of communication, but just asked for emails or updates; I understand that certain parts are hard to find or come late.
After another two weeks (after hearing nothing from Geek Squad), I called them again. Customer service told me that they could contact the repair center for an ""escalation"", but that they didn't explain what that was. When I asked for an explanation of the ""escalation"", the customer service agent said she couldn't help me and hung up. I had waited 30 minutes on hold. Needless to say, I was unhappy.
I next called the store I actually dropped it off at and I spoke with an agent, who finally explained the issue and set up notifications, so I could stay informed on the status and ETA. He seemed to confirm that Geek Squad has a serious customer-service problem. We're five weeks in now and I still don't have the computer. I think that, if I had been kept in the loop, I could have managed my expectations and mitigated my disappointment with Geek Squad. But I was kept in the dark and am very disappointed. I don’t know if I will return with this type of service. "
905,2,"This company has changed how they process insured phones right in the middle of my contract period. I received wrong advice from one of their workers and also informed to disregard the email that I received about printing off a mailing label because it does not work. NOW! I am going to be charged over $200 since now have to wait 1-2 weeks for a return box to be sent to me. Then will have to wait 4-6 weeks to get that refunded once they receive the defected device. When I asked for a tracking number and mailing address to send my device (I would pay for the shipping myself) so I do not get charged the $200; I was informed by a manager that I could not pay and mail the cell phone, that I had to wait for them to send me a bow and be charged the $$$ and then wait for a refund!!! BTW... I even tried to take the defective devise to the Geek Squad at my local Best Buy and even they would not ship it back. I WILL NEVER USE THIS SERVICE AGAIN."
906,2,"I purchased an LG refrigerator on 10.7.2015, the freezer suddenly quit working, I called Pacific Sales and had a repairman come look at it. He submitted his notes the same day, and since then I have heard nothing. I have called several times and have gotten the runaround. Pacific Sales says they have not received the notes from the company that sent the tech, SoCal that sent the tech told me Frank the technician was sick and had not sent notes, I called tech he says absolutely not true he submitted notes the same and has not been sick in years. I called back SoCal and am now being told notes were submitted, they are unsure of why we were told that. Pacific Sales says they don't have notes and cannot continue without them. This is the worst customer service I have ever received. It is unbelievable. BEST BUY sells this warranty. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! I don't believe a one star is even acceptable, maybe a negative star."
907,2,"I cannot begin to tell you how HORRIBLE their customer service is. Bought my stove in March 2015, it's been broken 6+ times for same part. This year alone 4+ times, attempting to ""lemon"" the stove. Have been lied to by at this point I think everyone who works in the call center as every time I call I get a different answer. First told it would have to be deemed ""unrepairable"" as it had brought too many times and they weren't going to pay for it to be fixed again. Then told it would have to ""break 1 more time"" to qualify as a lemon (which it has) to be told by the next person that they'll just continue to fix it forever (my warranty is 5 years). Then to be told it was being replaced, 5 different people including 2 managers told me this only to be told the next week that no it wasn't being replaced, they were all wrong. I have never had such horrible customer service...EVER."
908,1,"Pacific Sales (West Los Angeles) is the WORST!!! Beware!! Do not buy from them. We bought an expensive refrigerator from them in 2016 with an extended warranty. It has been over a week that we have gone with no refrigerator. We lost hundreds of dollars of food that spoiled when the refrigerator broke. I have three children, lunches and dinners need to be made. They sent two different repair companies to diagnose the problem. No one has gotten back to us. We cannot reach the warranty company on the phone - they do not pick up. We cannot reach the company they sent out to diagnose the problem either. Pacific Sales refuses to help us - they take no responsibility for the warranty they sold us. It is shameful how Pacific Sales conducts business. They will sell you anything but take no responsibility for it. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. Just awful!"
909,1,I requested a refund from Herbalife due to the fact I had an adverse reaction to their products. I'm being told it takes up to 4 weeks to do a refund. How in the world is this possible when it only takes them a few seconds to debit your account when you become a member. They received their product back a week ago and I haven't heard anything else from them. This company is very shady and their distributors are no better. They push these products and make you believe that they are best products in the world. They lie like a rug to get you to purchase them. Beware. The distributors are wolves in sheep clothing. I will never ever do business with this company again.
910,3,"I attended a bridal fair in Huntsville, AL in September 2015 almost a year before my wedding. I was called that same night and was told that I won a bunch of different things, one of which was a free trip. My fiancé (at the time) and I attended the cooking class and was sold on the awesome products. We were given our package of gifts we won, told how to retrieve everything and we even signed up to buy some products.
The next day, our account bank was hacked (not by this company) and closed for fraudulent activity. So, I called this company to change and give them our new account information... I STILL haven't talked to anyone. No one ever answered the phone, no one ever called back and no one ever sent any products. We were trying to pay but no one would ever call us back.
Now, on to this ""trip"" we won. We were told that we had to pay for the taxes for the trip... understandable! We sent two separate money orders. One was for $50 and the other was for $100. After we sent the $100 one, we got an email saying that we had to go online and fill out the form for our desired destinations (top two choices) and desired dates. We did that. Keep in mind, ALL of this was done BEFORE our wedding, as we were trying to use this trip as our honeymoon. We still have not heard anything back from this company. Our one year anniversary is coming up in 8 days!! I am very upset because I have been trying to contact this company for two years now!"
911,1,"This has been the worst, most painful experience. These guys are shady, unethical salesmen who don't care about the customer or the product they sell. I have contacted the Customer Service dozens of times with no answer. In fact it forwards you to Order Processing. I DO NOT NOR WOULD I EVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN. The pots and pans I received are different from the ones we were sold on. I should have been aware that this was a horrible company when I showed up to their BIG event and there were only two people in the audience. I leave this review as a warning to anyone who is remotely considering attending one of their demonstrations. They will blind you with free trips and false promises. I will continue to leave reviews on every website I can until the company calls me and provides me with a satisfactory resolution. I am very displeased with NutriChef."
912,1,"NutriChef doesn't even deserve a rating of one. I bought my pans in Feb of 2016 and didn't get them until the end of March. When I got the pans, 4 of the 7 came out of the box with brown spots on the inside and bottoms. It took me two weeks to finally get someone to call me back to discuss the issue. I left over 6 messages because no one ever answered the numbers they provided in the paperwork. It was such a hassle to get them to replace the pans, even though that was one of the big selling points ""no questions asked, we will send you a new pan!"" Ya, they didn't tell you that you would have to pay the $40 shipping every time and that it would take over 2 weeks for them to send you the return label with the address and then it took over a month to get the new pans in.
In the meantime, I was trying to cook with the pans that I still had at home and they are awful! I have done all the steps in the paperwork to ""find true medium"". I've watched the videos. I've even had friends come over and do the true medium test and these pans are awful. If they don't take over 30 minutes to warm up, then they burn everything that you cook in them! No matter how much oil and/or water you use, even though that was another big selling point, ""you can use little to no oil or water"". Worse than the pans tough, is the customer service from NutriChef, New Era, and Equitable Financing. You can never get a hold of anyone at NutriChef, always get an answering machine, and they will call back 2 weeks later.
New Era is pretty reasonable to talk to, but can't tell the same story twice. They told me that they would take the pans back and let NutriChef know when they had them, but told Stephanie from NutriChef the opposite, And she did the same thing with telling me it was New Era that had to authorize the return, but told Darryl from New Era that she isn't taking the pans back. But the worst was, Equitable Finance.
When I called to speak with them about ending the contract, this is who Stephanie from Nutrichef told me I needed to talk to, I reached the employee Jody **. He was rude, sarcastic, and told me ""You got what you paid for now. Deal with it honey."" It was so inconsiderate of the situation and I informed him that I would be going to my Navy legal to get them involved and his comment was ""oooh honey, is that supposed to intimidate me, hahaha whatever military is a joke!"" That was when I told him to have a good day and hung up. This whole process has been a pain in the neck and I advice everyone to stay away from these 3 companies! You will be paying a lot of money for something you can't even use!"
913,3,"I attended the NutriChef cooking show and liked it, especially the cleanup of the pans, and I get that their cookware is not as hazardous to health as other brands. So I got a whole kit from NutriChef. I've had their cookware for about a month now. I like the grill well and use the griddle a lot. But I don't know how to get the cookware cleaned because it gets this orange residue on it from the stuff that's cooked. The cookware is not getting cleaned as I would have wanted. It's hard to get all the residue off of the cookware when I cook, so I'm not happy with that part of it. It's a lot of money to pay for something if it's going to start looking bad very quickly."
914,2,"I’m very upset about the entire experience with NutriChef, and we’re trying to get our money back. We were told it was going to be a cooking show that we were going to be involved in and it’s going to be fun. Instead it was a high-pressure sales pitch situation to buy incredibly expensive dishware, and it was incredibly uncomfortable. The pots and pans are very impressive, but the whole process is messed up. They sucked us in and we’re probably going to pay off a pot for the rest of our lives. We’re not very happy about it.
We purchased something because we were unable to leave and we're locked in with the sale price only on that day. We’re stupid, young and vulnerable and so we got the cheapest thing, which was still $400, and were told that the interest was not an issue. We asked questions like if this is going to be an accumulating interest and was told no, each payment lowers it. This was three months ago and the interest has already been $22 each month.
And the whole vacation that we're supposed to get out of this is also... Their whole pitch was we attend the cooking show and we get a free vacation. We just have to do our own airfare. At this point, I don't even know if we'll be getting the vacation because there were so many fine prints, it's absolutely ridiculous. Also, I've gotten calls, emails and text messages from them literally daily and I don't know how to get my name off the list."
915,2,The cooking show with NutriChef was pretty educational although we didn't purchase any product because we didn't have the money. They also said that we won a Bahamas trip and they gave us something to mail in and that was back in January. I mailed mine in and still haven’t received anything from it. I'm not really happy with them after all.
916,2,"We went to a NutriChef show and it was like one long infomercial. They described their products, had a live cooking exhibition and said how to expect all their stuff and then later on, wanted us to buy it. The guy was informative giving a history of all the different kinds of pots and pans over the years and how the consumer market has changed and what the American market has needed over time. It was nice to hear that, but overall we weren't as interested as the other couples in the room. We did not buy anything and they seemed very disappointed in us that we didn't. We weren't really sure what we were invited for and it was an hour long. We stayed through, but we wouldn't go back."
917,3,"We attended NutriChef cooking show and it was a little bit misleading because we were told that we would receive a free meal, and my fiance and I got a styrofoam bowl of four vegetables that we had to split. So that was a little frustrating especially because we drove an hour and a half to go to this. And because it was such a late show, everything was closed by the time that we got out except for fast food places."
918,2,"I went to a wedding show and NutriChef offered me to sign up for a free knife. They did a good job on the cooking show but they really dramatized us a lot. Leaving was my favorite part of the show. I didn't like that--we're at a wedding show, obviously because we're getting married and they come up to you and approach you and they want you to sign up for a free knife, and then they call you to come watch their show with this knife, and they don't tell you anything it's going to be about. Then you get there and they hold you there until 11 o'clock at night and try to pressure you into buying all these stuff. Then we didn't buy anything because that's not why we went and then they told us nicely to leave because we didn't want to buy anything. I really didn't enjoy my experience with NutriChef."
919,3,"The NutriChef cooking show I attended was great. The whole thing was impressive – what they showed we could do with the pots and pans. We purchased one pan since it wasn’t in our budget at that time to make a large purchase. We’ve had it for six months now and our overall experience with it has been disappointing. For a $250 pan, we haven’t been 100% satisfied with it. The quality that we saw at the show and the quality that the one we got has been demonstrating is not equal. We feel that we got hustled a little bit.
The pan is great in terms of cooking temperature since we don’t need to turn the stove up as high. However, we’ve been following all the directions in terms of how to clean it or what to do before using it, but it still got marks on it. It wasn’t what we anticipated it to be. There were also the free gifts that were not from NutriChef, but they were given to them to give out to people. We had to send a check. We were going to get free things, but we didn’t - we just got our money taken. It was $170 plus the $250 pan, but we didn’t get our trip. It was a disappointing experience."
920,1,"I like the pots, the pans and the different cooking styles displayed in the NutriChef cooking show. But it was more of a waste of time because the pots and holders are overly priced and the things that were promised weren't given. I was told that they were giving out some of the stuff I've been looking at, but I have to pay to see the offer. So I wasn't enticed by that."
921,3,"My fiance heard about NutriChef through a bridal expo. It was required for us to come in to win a trip somewhere, so we went to one of the sessions and ended up buying a couple of pans. The look is really nice but they’re not really working the way I would like them to be. I’ve tried cooking a couple of different things on them. I know they say that you’re supposed to not have to use any type of spray or oil, but a couple of things that I cooked that I didn’t think I would need to use a spray for have been sticking and it looks like the pan has now changed color and got these different spots. I’m not really too happy with that right now."
922,1,"I tried to support my friend by buying some product. She was close to throwing all her products away since she could not sell it. She spent thousands of dollars and was stuck with the inventory. As for me, I had rectal bleeding for 2 days. I went to my doctor and he couldn't figure out why and we decided to go back to the same diet before Herbalife and my rectal bleeding went away. I used ** for the massive hemorrhoids. I told my friend and she did not believe me and gave me some meal replacement. I was reluctant to take it but tried it again. After two days I was urinating blood and my hemorrhoids returned. I broke out with blisters on my lips. My friend who sold me the product told me her aunt was urinating blood as well so I don't think it was a coincidence. Please avoid this product as much as possible."
923,2,"My husband purchased tickets to an Astros game on Saturday, August 11, 2018, online, with this pitiful excuse for an honest company. We printed our tickets and attended the game on Sunday, August 12, 2018. Come Monday morning, I checked our credit card and lo and behold, we had been charged two (2) times, for two (2) tickets each. When I called the aforementioned pitiful excuse for an honest company, I was told that they showed where tickets had been purchased twice. One order was for Section 327, Row 2, seats 15 and 16, which is the order we received confirmation and printed our tickets. The second order (which we did not place, nor receive confirmation) was for Section 253, Row 3, Seats 19 and 20.
Obviously, I would love to know if those seats were used (resold), or sat empty for the game. Of course, SeatGeek can't do anything about this, and insist that we placed two (2) orders. We, of course, did not place the second order, and therefore received no confirmation of this phantom order. WE WILL NEVER USE THIS TICKET SERVICE AGAIN! They give no option for ZERO stars!"
924,3,"I went to the Beyonce concert (8/8/2018) and planned to buy my tickets the night of as I am on a tight, tight budget and wanted to make sure I could really go. I bought them from a different ticket vendor that did not work out to begin with, and being in a rush and having used SeatGeek before I had no hesitation using this site. However, when I had purchased my tickets (two) and went to place them under the scanner, they were invalid and blinking red instead of green when scanned. I called SeatGeek and they sent a pdf of the tickets which still did not work under the scanner. Calling again I was put on and off hold for quite some time and was offered assistance without receiving much actual assistance. I wanted to get into the concert as my main priority but they were unable to help me find different tickets. I was told I would get my money back right away after filling out a long form. I was fine with this however with the other ticket company that I had issues with I was given my money back the minute I contacted them with my issue. I have filled out the form and I am still waiting to get my money back and I did not get to attend the concert. I will be deleting this app because although they were willing to help, the help was not great and if this is rarely supposed to happen, I would hope that when this issue does happen it could have be solved much faster than this and exceptions could be made to help me get into the concert. The thing about a concert is you spend the whole night getting ready and it takes more money to get to the concert than just the actual ticket so I lost more than the approximate $168 that I still do not have back. The gas money, parking, and other such expenses add up too, which also went to waste. I have never been the type to write a review but, as a broke college student who works hard, saves almost every penny, and splurges wisely (I still bought the cheapest tickets), I was extremely disappointed to have one of the only nights of summer I looked forward to, taken away."
925,3,"I purchased tickets as a Christmas gift approximately 12/01/17 for an event 11/10/18; Michigan Wolverines at Rutgers Scarlet Knights at High point Stadium in Piscataway, New Jersey to be exact. After purchase I realized these tickets were extremely overpriced and ask for a refund as the tickets were not even delivered yet. I was told these tickets cannot be refunded and that the tickets would be delivered to me via email on 11/03/18 which is seven days before the event. I was told not to worry because I could sell these tickets on websites like “StubHub” or “Ticketmaster”.
After about a month of asking how is this possible without the tickets in hand or ticket number to the event a customer service representative told me that “It may be possible to do this, and to ask “StubHub” if it is possible”. It is now 4 months before the event. Seat Geek still states all sales are final and my tickets will be delivered seven days prior to the event. After numerous e-mails they offered me a $20.00 credit but still have yet to answer how can I sell these tickets like they stated 6 months ago or cancel and refund my money. Seat Geek has the worst customer service I've ever experienced and can't give me a straight answer."
926,1,"Bought tickets to a Pirates game that got rained out. SeatGeek referred me to the Seller... TicketNetwork... for their policy on a rain check. I can get a replacement ticket but only for the rescheduled make up game and NO other. Tickets purchased thru the Pirates or StubHub can be exchanged for ANY other remaining game this season. Don't use SeatGeek... and if the actual Seller thru any other 3rd party ticket website is TicketNetwork, go elsewhere. Sorry I can't give either of these companies less than 1 star."
927,2,"First it was a part they forgot to ship, then they shipped but it hadn't arrived. Then it arrived but hadn't picked up from FedEx. Suddenly I get an update, ""repair complete"" yet nobody has even contacted me. Then I was told that was an automated message... (mistake)??? They claim they contacted me (THEY DIDN'T. I CAN PROVIDE PHONE LOGS FROM MY PHONE COMPANY.) Every single day it's a different excuse. Meanwhile, I now had to buy another laptop because I need to use a laptop everyday. The customer service is horrible, they are not directly in touch with the local service center, they have to contact someone else, who in turn contacts the local service center. And they won't give me the contact of the local service center. I am really frustrated and I WOULD NEVER NEVER buy a Lenovo laptop ever."
928,3,"Bought a new Lenovo Tab 4 8 tablet computer. It is very nice, sleek, thin, beautiful and offers a lot of features. However, people should be aware of at least one feature that has not proven out, at least for me. They claim that you can add an SD card and format it for ""internal"" use as expanded internal memory. When I tried to do that the tablet immediately recognized the card insertion and asked whether to format it for internal or portable (removable, shareable) use. I chose the internal. The tablet began to format the card, but failed claiming that the new card was ""corrupted"". I tried with two other new cards including other brands and the result was the same. Fortunately I was able to reformat the cards on my desktop computer to save them. So I decided that it would be better to have them for at least the portable type and reinserted a card as portable. The tablet recognized and I chose portable formatting, which the tablet did in about a split second.
Later I tried to move some picture files onto the card to get some use out of it and when I tried the tablet complained that I could not do that until I pressed some “confirm” button which does not exist. In other words even though I have added a 128 GB card, I am unable to use it. Additionally, with my old tablet I was able to get more utility out of it by adding a third party software called MLUSB, which gave me more access to the internal files on the tablet. For instance I can insert a USB thumb drive and read its contents and move files to or from it using MLUSB. But on the new Lenovo tablet they have somehow BLOCKED ALL ACCESS to those files and I can no longer add or copy or transfer files to or from a USB drive. The trend is taking control of my tablet out of my hands. Also, my old tablet had 8 GB of internal memory and new with no added software less than 4 GB was used.
The new Lenovo sounds great with 16 GB of internal memory, but with fewer programs installed off the top, more than half of the memory is already used up. In short, I like the physical apparatus, but not the software writer's philosophy. Also I notice that now almost every program is asking for permission to access everything, camera, phone photographs, microphone, contacts etc. "
929,2,"I wanted to purchase tickets to a baseball game for a particular area of the stadium. After I went through the entire purchase process, they sent me an email telling me those tickets were no longer available. So I went back on the site. Tickets still listed on the site. I clicked on them again, they said, ""No longer available"". So I went to a different site and purchased tickets. AN HOUR LATER they sent me an email pending the sale. I was out of town and no longer monitoring my email since I had made my purchase. Get to the office on Monday and see the email. I sent email to them that morning. No response. At the end of the day I called. The answer they gave me is, ""I can see how that was confusing but there is nothing I can do."" WILL NEVER USE THIS SITE AGAIN!!! Kiss $166 Goodbye."
930,1,"Stay away from SeatGeek. They engage in dishonest, shady and non-transparent business practices. I purchased for 4 tickets for an NBA game which we were planning to attend for our upcoming trip to Orlando. However, our plans changed and we can no longer go to the game. I contacted SeatGeek within 24 hours of purchase to cancel our tickets and request a refund and at this point there are still 13 days to the game.
In all fairness, their FAQ section states that refunds may not be possible. What I don't understand is that SeatGeek claims to be the seller when you purchase the tickets but when I contacted their customer service I was told that the ticket was sold by a ""Fellow fan that used SeatGeek Marketplace""! They claim to be transparent but why hide who the actual seller is? When you are in a marketplace website such as eBay, Amazon or Etsy, you clearly know who the seller is. However, that is not the case with SeatGeek. Instead, they like to lie about it!!!"
931,2,I purchased 2 tickets to see Wizkid on Saturday 9/16/2017 at the Smart Financial Center in Houston TX. After purchasing tickets of $180 no one mentioned the concert was cancelled or postponed. SEATGEEK was still selling tickets after the fact. When I contacted customer service 24 hours later they didn't do anything to accommodate me. They told me to contact the seller. Knowing dang well they wouldn't give me any info to contact the seller to get my refund back. Whomever I spoke to wasn't very bright! I feel like they ripped me off. I was told the tickets would still be useful once the concert is rescheduled. It's been 4 months and I'm still pissed off. I guess I'll be waiting on a concert that will never happen. I will never ever purchase from this off brand website again. (Ticketmaster) (StubHub) are the best!!! Thanks for nothing.
932,1,"I gave one star because they won't let you give zero. Don't use this site for tickets. They do not honor their guarantee for your tickets. I spent hours getting tickets and booking a hotel to go to the Big Ten Championship Game only to be left out in the cold and watching the game in our hotel. Our electronic tickets were sold multiple times by their merchant and SeatGeek did not find us replacement tickets and just said, ""Sorry, go back home"".
We are heartbroken that we traveled so far and got turned away like second class citizens. Other merchants had ticket reps at the venue but there was no one in site for SeatGeek to help us. If you work hard for your money, like my family, do your business somewhere else that appreciates and respects your hard earned money or your hearts may be left broken too. We don't get to go to many events so this was to be a lifetime memory. A mere refund does nothing for the hours of travel and hundreds we spent for a heartbroken trip."
933,3,"Bought tickets to a Bob Seger concert on October 9, 2017 for a October 24th concert. The concert was already cancelled before I purchased the tickets. The company selling the tickets, (Fan Exchange through SeatGeek), never informed me that the concert was already cancelled when I purchased the tickets. Although, in SeatGeek bylaws and conditions it states that it won’t sell tickets of concerts that have been cancelled or postponed.
I called SeatGeek and they stated that they didn’t sell the tickets and to contact Fan Exchange as that was the seller of the tickets even though I went through the SeatGeek website to purchase the tickets. Went to the venue to find out that the concert had been postponed to a later date. After some research found out that the concert had been cancelled before I even bought the tickets. Contacted both SeatGeek and Fan Exchange to get a refund. SeatGeek said to contact Fan Exchange. Fan Exchange said that they wouldn’t give a refund and we should have known that the concert was cancelled because they sent out an email on the 4th of Oct. They were still selling tickets for upcoming concerts that were cancelled to date."
934,3,"I purchased tickets through SeatGeek. They actually came from Ticketfly. Upon calling SeatGeek I was told to look up the phone number and call Ticketfly. Upon calling Ticketfly I was told they could not contact the broker. They said they gave the broker a cut off time of 6 pm est. and to call them back at that time. When I called at 6:01 pm est. I received a voice message stating their office hours are 9 am to 6 pm est. I called SeatGeek and basically they said, “Sorry you are already at the game but there is nothing we can do.” I asked for a manager, which none were available. Then I was promised a callback the next day. It's been 4 days and I have not heard from SeatGeek. Maybe I should press #1 to buy tickets. I bet someone will answer."
935,1,"I have used SeatGeek in the past and thought I'd try again despite having a rough first encounter. This last time I tried to place an order for MLB playoff tickets and had my order canceled just before the game. If you try and use a promo code on their website, they will reject it even though it is sold by them. The promo codes do not have any exclusions except for that it has to be sold by SeatGeek which my tickets were. I tried calling customer service three times and each time a supervisor is supposed to call me back within the hour.
I am now on the second day waiting, The game has passed and I had to pay a higher rate for tickets from a local scalper. They have no customer service. They ship you overseas to people who literally hang up the phone when I asked to wait on the line for a supervisor instead of being called back. Don't waste your time with this horrible company. Pay the extra money for a legitimate company and don't get screwed right before the game."
936,2,"Purchased tickets for a football game for very specific seats. Paid and order confirm by company. Received email a week or so prior to the event that the seats changed... Mine were great, alternative okay but worse than what I had. Offered a $20 refund or full refund. Too late to get other tickets at a decent price at this point. To add insult to injury, two days prior to event still hadn't received tickets. Reached out and they were express mailed. Unacceptable! I lost money. How do you go after a company like this? Awful experience and will never use again."
937,2,"I purchased four tickets for the Dodger vs. Giant game on September 12, 2017. When we got to the gate, only three of the four tickets worked. I had to visit customer service at the Giants stadium. Customer Service told me that the season ticket holder called and had the ticket held for someone else. I called SeatGeek and spoke to Mari. She apologized for the inconvenience and offered me ONE ticket not near my family.
I told her I didn't drive 3 three hours for a baseball game not to sit with my family. She offered us four comparable tickets on the first base side and said she would email me the new tickets. Since it was the end of the fourth inning, the customer service lady gave me a ticket to get into the stadium to see my family. In the meantime, SeatGeek called my daughter's phone and offered a refund plus 20%, which my daughter accepted. A week later, we have yet to receive the new tickets or a refund. I will NEVER purchase from SeatGeek again!"
938,1,"SeatGeek is far from a reliable source. The system is set up as an aggregator, where they charge your credit card, and then leave it up to the third party to deliver the tickets. They do not verify if tickets are available at the time of sale. I found myself in a situation where I purchased same day tickets, the charge went through, the tickets were confirmed, and three hours later I received notification that the tickets were unavailable. SeatGeek, and the ticketnetwork.com both pointed fingers at each other and neither was willing to accept responsibility for providing accurate information on the SeatGeek site about the tickets that were posted. Very weak operation!"
939,1,"On July 8, I paid $58.00 per ticket for the NBA summer league championship game in Las Vegas at SeatGeek. Once we arrived at the site, we realized that the same exact tickets (free seating) are sold by the UNLV ticketing office live for $30.00 per ticket. There were plenty of seats/tickets left for the game. I expect SeatGeek to eliminate these ticket-scalping SCAM inventory and am surprised that the transaction was allowed to go through. I asked for a refund of the price difference, but was rejected with a response of ""We're sorry to hear that there were more affordable tickets at the box office, but tickets on the secondary market are often priced higher than face value, which is allowed. Because of this, we are unable to refund your order.""
They provide absolutely ZERO value in ensuring that the inventory pricing is legit (and in some cases legal). Event: 2017 NBA Summer League Championship. Venue: Thomas & Mack Center, Las Vegas, NV. Time: Mon, Jul 17 at 1 pm. Section: ga. Row: ga. Price per ticket: $58.00. Quantity 2. Delivery fee: $0.00. Total cost: $116.00."
940,1,"I had read reviews on SeatGeek and thought I understood what could go wrong and avoided that. However, I got caught, too! We are headed cross-country for a big birthday celebration and wanted tickets to a Tony-winning show. The Ticketmaster service fees were almost the price of the tickets, so I looked for alternatives and read up on SeatGeek.
I bought two tickets, had a reasonable service charge assessed ($25 for two tickets instead of more than $150 for two via Ticketmaster). I got a screen response with a confirmation code, kept that window open and began watching my email for the ticket confirmation to arrive. After more than an hour, I decided to take a screenshot of what had popped up on the SeatGeek site, saved the file and went to bed.
I checked and my credit card has a pending charge for the related amount. Still no email. We're now more than 12 hours later. I've been asked by SeatGeek to review them and did. They sent a follow up, asking why the low review. I wrote back and explained. No reply. I finally emailed them and asked about why I was charged for tickets, got a confirmation number for tickets, but still had no email with info about the tickets. At that point, I learned that they are only a broker and don't actually have the tickets. So, they referred me to their vendor -- Telecharge. So, I had to phone Telecharge, give them my confirmation number, address, phone number, email, etc. And, now they say they'll send me the email confirmation in another 3 hours.
If I order from Amazon and they subrogate my order, they (Amazon) makes it right. I don't have to track down another vendor. I told this to SeatGeek and they said they would try to move that direction and would share my insights. Bull! They have been in business for 8 or more years and still don't have this figured out? I'm hoping my email confirmation arrives. And, I am hoping it's not all a scam. But, don't expect SeatGeek to honor their commitment to you. And, don't expect that their vendors will be timely, either. Not a fan!"
941,1,"Our salesperson was absolutely terrific. It went downhill from there. We came to purchase a Class A motorhome, and ended up buying a Class C. A very pushy manager misinformed us about the financing between the two units, which we discovered later. We previously owned over 10+ motorhomes in the past. When we went to pick the coach up in Sanford, we found out that the finance people between Daytona and Sanford didn't communicate. We have to go now to the DMV to get our tags straightened out. As it goes for delivery, it gets worse. The outside was not clean, the inside was never cleaned, and popcorn was all over the place. Our walkthrough was a joke. We have no manuals on anything, except the sprinter chassis and two operator manuals. We had to beg another salesperson for a screwdriver to put the temporary tag on. Do yourself a favor and find another dealership."
942,3,"I purchased a new Roadtrek in Sept of '18. Brought home knowing that several items were missing and was informed that when I bring it in in 2 weeks everything will be taken care of. In fact they wrote a invoice of ""we owe you"". Well I brought it back along with an item that needed repair as it did not work, well 3 months later I still did not have the vehicle fixed. Yes I did get the usual the parts are on order. They sent the wrong parts, the parts are on back order. They take 10 days to come from Canada. They changed the wire harness 5 times. The mechanic that does the work is on vacation this week, and on and on. Meanwhile I get a notice saying how do I like my vehicle now that I had it 3 mos. Boy talk about adding insulte to injury."
943,3,"We recently purchased a 2018 Intent from La Mesa RV in Daytona Beach FL and picked it up in Sanford, FL. The La Mesa RV sales team in Daytona was very nice BUT this is where it stops. The financing representative tried to “make” us sign our contract adding $6000 worth of warranty items to it! Unless we had reviewed the contract carefully we would have completely missed it. We had insisted we did not want this even before he printed the contracts out and he argued with us stating we MUST sign the contract with the $6000 on it stating that when we picked up the unit it would be taken off.
I was not born yesterday! This is dishonesty at its worst and Winnebago should be ashamed to associate its long standing and excellent brand with such a dishonest company like La Mesa. I understand their volume with Winnebago and the revenue that you generate from La Mesa in general. After I told them I would walk from the deal if he didn’t reprint the contract WITHOUT the $6K he reluctantly reprinted it and his demeanor became combative and nasty. FAR from customer friendly.
BUT it doesn’t stop there. We left a deposit of $500 with them and was given a receipt for it. When we went to pick up the coach and met a different finance person in Sanford and after we had signed all papers, we had to ask about the $500 deposit. It was nowhere on any of the final signed paperwork. After discussion the finance person again reluctantly put a check request in and and gave us a copy of it and said we would have our deposit returned within a week. We are now starting the 3rd week and no check.
When we called we were given the run around and a promise of a returned call. Of course no call! This is YOUR agent, your dealer the one you gave a gold star for on your website! We cant be the first customers who have complained about La Mesa’s shady dealings but yet they get the gold star. Their hubris is loud and clear and it only tarnishes and damages the valued Winnebago brand especially when you endorse and award the a “favored” status on your website. Remember we who are customers. Without us there would be no need to have dealers. This is how owners of your entry level coaches are treated; as second class customers."
944,3,"In January I purchased a 2018 Hymer Aktiv (list price $106k) from La Mesa in Davis, CA (sales are now in West Sacramento). Nothing regarding the shower pan, roof or the radio was mentioned during the inspection/orientation. I spotted drops of water in the moonroof at the forward end of the van but I was told it is because they just pressure washed the unit so the water probably sprayed up under the lid and is simply dripping down. I have no experience with RV's so I took his word for it. I noticed after departing with my new purchase that the radio was popping up warnings constantly, so I informed the service dept."
945,1,"We purchased two RVs over the course of a year, first one used. Second one new. We were delayed on receiving the first used one because they had to inspect every system to ensure quality. We had a sewerage spill as a iPhone was stuck in the black water valve... guess they forgot to check that. I repaired it myself while on holiday. When we test drove the new one I mentioned a vibration in the front end at speed, it was written into the sales papers and I was assured it would be checked and rectified. Going through the orientation I asked about the vibration and was told they sent it out and all is good. Well it wasn't but I dealt with it and worked around the speeds where it was really bad.
As I'm preparing for a upcoming trip I decided to have the tires rebalanced. Much to my surprise I had a bent wheel... Hmmm if they had it sent out for the pre sale vibration check they would have found the bent wheel. Please do not believe a word they say after you leave the sales dept. Regarding service... oh what could I say. I paid for a special coating. Yeah right. It was never applied but they are going to recoat it after the fact. They repaired a leaking window but you guessed it still leaking. Waiting since September for new vinyl graphics for the front, hopefully it'll happen sometime this year. It takes 4 to 6 weeks to make a appointment for service then you go through the parts ordering song and dance. I could go on and on. Some people walk away happy, I try to keep my sense of humor about everything as I believe my service advisor is truly trying to provide quality service."
946,2,"My husband contacted La Mesa RV by phone in February 2018 to get information on a Winnebago View Motorcoach. He was assisted by Barry in Sales and Frank, Finance Manager. My husband stated that we were not ready to buy a RV yet but was looking for information on costs and required down payment. My husband also stated that when we were ready to buy that we wanted to go thru our existing bank who held our existing RV loan. La Mesa RV stated that in order to provide us with the potential cost with down payment that they would need to run our credit one time. My husband reiterated that we were not ready to purchase and Barry stated that was fine. La Mesa RV then proceeded to submit our credit application to multiple banks which resulted in multiple hard inquiries appearing on our credit reports.
When I contacted the credit agencies to have these hard inquiries expunged, I was informed by Experian and Transunion that I would need letters from each of the banks that processed the credit request asking to have the hard inquiries removed. The banks stated that they could not do this as the requests were ""Dealer-Initiated"" and that I would need to speak with La Mesa to have them resolve my issue. I spoke with Frank, Finance Manager after requesting a call back from the La Mesa RV Finance Manager. He apologized for my experience but stated that La Mesa RV is not able to create the requested letter for me as they cannot intercede on behalf of an individual in terms of their credit report.
I then contacted the La Mesa RV Customer Relations team on 6/11/2018 and spoke with Jay on 6/12/2018. Mr. contacted me back after obtaining my file and stated that no letter would be available as there were no records created by either Frank or Barry (Sales) stating that (1) we were not ready to purchase and (2) we did not approve our application going out to multiple banks as we wanted our credit application only to go to our existing bank.
No apologies given and when I asked to speak with the President/CEO of La Mesa RV, Jay informed me that the President/CEO was traveling extensively and would not return my phone call for at least 4-5 weeks. Jay went on to state that the President/CEO would refer me back to him as Jay handles all issues and there would be no available recourse for me in this case. I informed Jay that due to this response that I would not be doing any future business with La Mesa RV and will be submitting a complaint."
947,2,"I bought a new Travato from La Mesa 2 years ago and bought the extended warranty for 6 years. A couple of months ago, the top refrigerator vent just blew off during a wind storm. Winnebago stated that the vent was reinstalled by La Mesa when the vehicle arrived at their lot. Now for the great customer service... When they finally got the part, I waited for over an hour until Ryan strutted out stating that they didn't order the parts needed to install it. After a couple of weeks, several unanswered phone calls, and an email to the service manager, I was finally able to get the vent installed. It's been 2 weeks and it's coming out again. I'm so frustrated with these people I could cry. Wait, I have..."
948,1,"We purchased a used RV from La Mesa which they kept for a week ""while they serviced it."" When my husband brought it home he found a fuel float and sending unit in the RV. They are refusing to fix this (we are not able to ascertain what our fuel level is) as it was ""bought as is and your husband inspected it."" So my husband should have ascertained that the fuel gauge was ""non-functional"" and that during the week that they had to completely service it no one found this replacement part in the RV??? Hmmm... So no one found this replacement part so what else did they not ""see or find?"" DO NOT DO BUSINESS with this company. Their dishonesty is unbelievable!!!"
949,3,"I have to agree with the other comments regarding the purchase of a motorhome at La Mesa. On April 14, 2018 we attend the RV show at Jet Blue Park in Fort Myers, Florida, the only dealer there was LaMesa, which was misleading to their TV advertising. We drove a 2018 Thor Hurricane, the whole RV shook. Then we drove a 2018 Winnebago. We decided to purchase the Thor after we were told this shaking would be fixed like new. This information and other items were written on a sheet for repairs. We took delivery on April 28, 2018, our bad, we did not drive the coach before we paid for it.
We drove the coach back to Naples, it did drive and ride a little better than the test drive. The coach was parked for a week, then were offered a free weekend at Cypress Trails in Ft. Myers for the weekend of May 4-7, 2018. While we were there we experienced a few other issues, and decided to drop the coach off at La Mesa for repairs and correct the steering issue. We were told own the coach and our responsibility to take it to the chassis shop for repair. We explained it was like that when purchased the coach. Well the coach is still there for repairs for now and they haven't made the warranty repairs. We are picking it up on Friday to take to the chassis shop. I feel we have been mistreated, taken advantage of, and told the coach was repaired and driven and this is not true."

We have never meet so many rude, incompetent, people working in one company, Monday April 30, 2018 we had our orientation class, which went very well. Next stop Finance - he was either having a bad day, or just didn't like us! Maybe, because we were asking questions! Directly under the ""Price of Vehicle"" Is ""Dealer Services Fee"" $995. So of course we questioned this amount. ""It was for Prepping your camper,"" O.K. So I googled ""dealer service fee"". ""This is a fee that a dealer will to charge you for preparing the Vehicle (RV, T.T.)"". It's a ridiculous attempt at making an extra profit, because vehicle preparation is simply a part of doing business! We didn't want to be thrown out of his office, so we just paid the fee!"

She will threaten you with court and who knows how she took it out on my horse. I wish I knew everything I heard about her BEFORE i asked Sarah to train my horse... I always wondered why she didn't have very many students and why she would ask me why people at the glass ed shows wouldn't come take lessons from her.PS: I have been told she is not welcomed (or has been kicked out) to certain barns in the area because of many of the things people have stated about her( her training abuse, people abuse, craziness, etc.)...

956,3,"I purchased a show quality fawn male to be used for stud from Imogene that had health issues. I just accidentally found this site and noticed Imogene's name so went on to read it. I was looking for a Beautiful Healthy fawn Frenchie with a really nice head and came across Imogene's ad, in dog fancy magazine i believe is were I saw her ad. I gave her a call, how nice she was on the phone. She informed me she had a returned male under a year old. A crazed women in California that starved the puppy and said a few vets checked out this dog and said he had elongated pallet. She said she did not know what they were talking about she didn't have that in her lines so she took him back and had him vet checked and put under by her vet to have his elongated pallet examined. He passed with flying colors by her vet and was for sale as a show quality potential stud. She would stand behind him and guarantee him 100 %. So I trusted her and sent her the Money for him. As soon as he arrived i told her he spits up Flem all the time, she told me to keep him on Bill jack dog food that is refrigerated. I did and it did nothing to help him. In the mean time a couple months went by and I sent her a $400 deposit on a female puppy. She sold the puppy I sent the deposit for and would not return my deposit or my calls or emails. I had to send a friend that was passing thru her state to her door to ask for the refund she would not answer the door but shortly after i did receive a $400 refund in the mail. The Male i bought from her around April 2002 died suddenly with no warning Oct 2003. autopsy showed his lungs filled up with blood due to a small hole that leaked fluid over time to eventually kill him. My vet said it was congenital. I called Imogene, She was sorry but would not stand behind her dogs. I noticed a women named Lisa In California had a similar sounding problem with one of Imogene's dogs that she returned. I wonder if I bought the dog she returned with health issues? How come Imogene's vet passed this Frenchie’s exam? And how come she wouldn't stand behind her dog when he died from abnormalities? Shouldn't a decent breeder stand behind there dogs with health issues! NOT all people are trying to get something for nothing. I just wanted a healthy Frenchie from a decent breeder. "

959,1,"Kim Komando uses IPOD as one her advertisers. On her website she represents that you will receive a free IPOD for conducting a survey and states that it really works. What she doesn't tell you is that the survey is very, very long and is comprised of other advertisers asking questions about likes, dislikes, etc. The real problem lies in buying some of these advertisers products. The first page of the survey states you need to buy 3 of the products advertised on that page (which is extensive). If you do that, the survey moves to the next page and guess what... you have to buy three more items. By the time you figure out that this is really unscrupulous business practice, you have already purchased 3 gimmicky items and there is no turning back. Most of the offers say you can return items but that is really a nightmare and I found impossible to do in one case. I never, never do these kind of things but since Komando represented that the offer was real, I trusted her. Now, not only do I have American Express fighting with one of the vendors for unscrupulous business practices because I could not contact them by phone as required, I have received a barrage of emails from companies that had no way of getting this brand new email address except through komando and iPod. I am very, very angry and disappointed with this digital goddess and that she would assign her endorsement to such a scam. DON'T TRUST WHAT SHE SUPPOSEDLY ENDORSES. "

This lie was told to me about 30 or 40 times over the next 7 months. Always saying it will be just a few more weeks or next month or by the end of the year. I spoke with a man name of Jim Henry the first time then was switched to a Chris Nyiri. Sometimes they return my calls and other times they did not. They ask for $2000 up front and I paid it thinking this would be a done deal very soon. As late as March 5th I was told this was still a done deal and they were just waiting for the company to give the OK and papers would be sent out ASAP. I want you all to know I am still waiting.

962,1,"IN MY OPINION, THIS PLACE (MIAMI AUTO SALES) IS A SCAM! SERIOUSLY! Their advertised ""down payments"" on Craig's List are not real! Once you get in there they take you to a side office and a guy says he wants to know what the salesman told me cause ""they"" the salesmen ""do not always tell the customers right"". (WHAT?) He then told me the ""down payment"" is followed by another $500.00 in 30 days and then another $500.00 30 days after that. Then the actual monthly payments will start after the additional $1000.00 are paid on top of the ""down payment"" being advertised. WAIT... IT GETS BETTER! (OR WORSE!) I paid half the advertised ""down payment"" cause the vehicle (a Ford Explorer) would not start when I attempted to test drive it. They jumped it and then the Explorer died as the salesman and I pulled out of the parking lot. I asked them to fix what was wrong with it and I would come back with the other half of the ""down payment"" once they notify me the vehicle was repaired. When I came back the vehicle was still not fixed! Also, they pulled out the paperwork and left the room with me alone with a stack of papers requiring my signature. I then realized what the man told me about the ""down payment"" plus the two additional $500.00 payments was a lie cause the paperwork to reflect additional payments double what he said. Also, they originally told me there was a 90 day/3000-mile warranty on the vehicle, but they wanted me to sign an ""As Is"" contract and agree that there was no warranty ""in writing"". When I asked the salesman (Chris Loynaz) about the differences reflected in the papers compared to the ""second"" story I was told by the other man, he (Chris Loynaz) got the other man to come into the room. When I questioned him why everything was not what he or the salesman (Chris Loynaz) originally told me, he said the ""extra"" money was the sales tax - even though the sales tax was already reflected in the paperwork. When I questioned him about that he got irritated and walked out of the room. I had to demand my money back... and they then made me sit around for about 30 minutes until the salesman (Chris Loynaz) came back in and handed me back my money and he then walked away. From there everyone avoided me and to me it was obvious they just hoped I would leave without warning all the other unsuspecting customers what they did to me. BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, AND IN MY OPINION, THESE GUYS ARE CROOKS! THEY ARE LIARS! THEY ARE SCAMMERS!"

So I called again and the next representative was equally rude and seemed very bothered by my questions.

So far, I saw a pair of Ray Bans I wanted for the eyeglasses and a pair for the sunglasses that I NEED TO WEAR WHILE DRIVING. The eyeglasses I chose with the prescription turned out to be little close to $500.00. The sunglasses would be another $399.00 so for both pairs, $999.00. This was not the special advertised. Buy one get one 50% off. Not on designer glasses or sunglasses (SMALL PRINT NOT RAYBANS). I eventually settled on a pair glasses that were cheaper, but not by much. I felt at the mercy of the Store, I needed my glasses, and they were going to get paid. I was angry. I said to the clinician, (salesperson) you expect to charge that much for glasses up here? WOW! people will go broke up here. What isn't good for me, I have to wear glasses, I can't see while I drive, and need sunglasses. I wear my glasses while at work, in the house, in stores. But, not while driving. I presented Nationwide with providing my own sunglass frame and filling the prescription with their lenses. It didn't matter, 358.00 with polarization and 349.00 without. I was shocked. This company grouches people who are at the mercy due to the fact, people need to see. Now, I am super mad, and will never, ever go there again.

By the time i called to check if my gift had arrived on valentine’s day my credit card had already been charged twice for the gift. The gift had not arrived. Tomorrow will make one full week since the gift was meant to have been delivered and it has not yet materialised.

After speaking with the office manager who basically called me a liar yet was unable to explain why I had the fee or why my paperwork was missing he proceeded to tell me I was being dismissed from the practice yet did not provide me a reason. This office is a complete mess and everyone needs some serious customer service training. I have still not received my requested records I am sure my paperwork will get lost again."

Since I'm beyond warranty, customer service won't allow me to even speak with technical support to ask for advice. I have spent countless hours researching these issues and the only one I've succeeded in fixing is the defective keyboard - by purchasing a replacement part.
A friend of mine who is an engineer told me that several decades ago his company built forklifts that lasted ""too long"". Customers never needed to purchase a new one, which was bad for profits. He claims that Engineering now decides on the acceptable ""life cycle"" of their products. It appears that LENOVO has adopted this philosophy and is now building disposable laptops. I hope that I'm mistaken but this has been my experience so far. My complaint against LENOVO is currently pending with the BBB. All I'm asking for is technical support to address these problems. If LENOVO refuses to be reasonable with me, I will NEVER buy their products again.... and I will continue to repeat my bad experience everywhere I can find a forum."

980,1,"Publishers Renewal Service has been taking money out of my checking account since April 2004 with out my approval. I only found out when my checking account kept having bounced check's and they were taking out a fee for each check that was bounced. I had to go to the bank and close this account and open a new checking. After many numerous fees and all the hassle to do so I decided to look on the internet and found out I wasn't the only one with the same problem! I tried to contact this rip-off company but to my dismay could not get through to the phone number that was available. I,m in the process right now of contacting the MD Attorney General's office to see if they can help me solve this issue. I will keep all of you informed of the out come of this mess."
981,1,"This is the most poorly written software i have ever come across. We have had the very unfortunate experience of using this crap software for 10 months. We spent $8000 for the package plus $600 for the estimating software. The interface with QuickBooks is a nightmare! Error messages up the ass!!! We are a very busy electrical contracting company with 4 phone lines ringing constantly. We don’t have time for these idiotic error messages that require us to stop dead in our tracks and spend 45 minutes on hold with tech support to figure out this POS (PIECE OF SHIT) system. My advice, DONT BUY IT!"
982,1,"AOL Internet Service has turned a fraudulent claim over to a collection agency in Ohio for over $100.00 against me. I purchased a Gateway computer and AOL service came free for one year with the purchase. (It was a package deal). I called AOL before the year was up to make sure that the service would be cancelled before the year was up because I had arranged a different internet service and did not want to be billed from two companies. AOL cancelled their service on the day we agreed on before the year was over. I never received a bill or any correspondence indicating I had an outstanding bill. (which I do not!) However, I received a called last evening from a collection agency trying to collect on a bill from AOL. I do not owe them. I do not know why they are a dishonest company, but I will never use their service again. I recommend that others beware if they use their service!"
983,1,"I have beena faithfull fool of Service Magic. Their filters are non-existent. In theory it does work. The problem is there are too many tire kickers and internet players that are not legitimate. If you waste more time and complain they might give you back a few bad leads, good luck. The contractor pays and pays and pays while the customers are not serious. They will not allow you to pay for bids so you are at the mercy of the customer, if they exist, and you waste more time while Service Magic rakes in the money form 3 or 4 contractors one each POTENTIAL LEAD. There filters suck and their service is worse. They should be invaded and their computors burned!!!!"
984,2,"On 2/20/2010 a charge for $99.95 was made to my checking account. An internet search led me to the company Maximum Platinum, an internet shopping service that offers a $10,000 line of credit. After reading their terms and conditions and calling the phone numbers available, I determined that this wass the same company which charged me. I have sent their customer service an e-mail threatening legal action if they do not refund my money. Apparently, this company gets customers when a 3rd party form is filled out, such as an application for a check or payday loan. I know I did not even request any information on this business, let alone fill out an application. I have recieved nothing from this company verifying an application, they simply chat=rged my account. I have a prepaid legal service and will turn it over to them if they fail to refund my money."
985,2,"We had a coupon for an introductory cleaning Ravinia Maid Service, so we decided to give them a try. Not only did the maid break my bucket, my broom and my vacuum cleaner, but there was not a single room cleaner after their visit than before. When I first came home, I noticed a few things that were out of place, but did not realize the extent of the rip off. I called the company and they asked me to take pictures of the house and send them. As I began taking pictures I realized how little was done, and more importantly how my house had been treated. They gave me one excuse after another for why they could not come out to see my house at a time that was convenient (including from the time I came home on), Next they tried to tell me why they were not responsible. I did not ask them to replace broken items, only to clean. The next morning as I was on my way to work they called and asked to have someone come over (while I was not home), to which I declined. By the end of the day, they told me that too much time had elapsed, and it was out of their hands. I have had experience with many services in the past, certainly some are better than others, some days are better than others. There is no excuse for this company. Their maid did not clean, and their managers refused to acknowledge their responsibility to provide a service."
986,2,"I normally do all of the maintenance work on my own vehicles. I had other things to do so I took my wife’s car to ASS for an oil change. The oil filter is a bit of a bear to get to, so before I left, I put a mark on it so I would know if they changed it or not. When I got the car back, damned if it didn't still have the same Fram filter I put on it 3000 miles ago. I looked at the receipt and they charged me $7.95 for it. I took the car back and told them what they did, and that I wanted the charge put back on my card. The manager assured me that I was mistaken, and took the car to the lift to inspect it himself. He agreed with me, and told me it was an honest mistake. I don't even know if they put fresh oil in the car. An oil change is a two part job, oil-filter, if a technician can't get that straight, I sure don't want them doing any major repairs. They credited the charge back to my card, and apologized. I assured them that it would not happen again. How often does this happen to people who do not mark their parts or know to check what they paid for? Don't trust that just because they give you a receipt that says they did the work, and charge you for it, that it's actually been done. I'll be doing my own oil changes from now on. I've given a lot of money to this company for brake jobs, etc.... I guess they don't need my money."
987,1,"This is the worst service ever.  This company is actually a scheme to take your money.  They absolutely NEVER fix anything.  Always find the small print to deny responsibility.  Worthless company should be ashamed of themselves.  Advice for everyone -I learnt this after the hard way with them- spend some time and get to know a good handyman... 100% trustful, more reliable and go that way.  Whatever happens is going to be more productive, less expensive and less frustrating than dealing with this company.  The whole system, how these companies work, their M.O. is just to steal our money. In this particular case we had a washer machine in an apartment we rent out.  It got broken.  We have the best tenants you could possibly ask for, very patient.  After several phone calls, visits and back and forth, Atlas technician says we needed to buy a part....we sent them a check for $165 for the part... they bought the part... they installed they part... then they told us the machine was not working and we needed to buy a new one...We go and buy a new stacked washer/drier machine.  Ask for the $165 and they would not give them back to us. U-N-B-E-L-I-E-V-A-B-L-E."

I called on Tuesday around 1:30 p.m. thinking it is after 11.00 a.m. and see what he found out. He said have not had time yet he would get back to me. I get a call at 4:00 p.m. and he says I need 2 lower ball joints on front of vehicle and a strap for gas tank. He said 65.00 for each ball joint and 89.00 for gas tank strap. I said when will you have it done we need the vehicle. Be done tomorrow. I said OK do the ball joint and strap and he said he would call tomorrow when it is done. I said great! No call. I call before I leave work at 3:00 p.m. and he tells me they brought him the wrong parts and he would not get them until 4:00 to 4:30 p.m. and was busy tonight he works at the college and would not get it completed until Thursday. I said can I drive it because I need the vehicle. No it is apart and not possible. Again OK will pick up after I get home on Thursday. He calls on Thursday and says it is completed around 1:00 p.m. I said I will stop over and pay you around 3:45 p.m. and take the keys and pick it up later because my wife is busy and can not drive it home until later. I go at 3:45 p.m. bill is 1099.25 I said what is all this. He put a drivers tie rod, Passenger tie rod, brake pads, drivers side calipers. I said what is all of this. He said well it needed it. Why did you not let me know. I would have taken it out of there in a second. The vehicle is a 2001. I WROTE HIM A CHECK AND WALKED OUT BEFORE i SAID SOMETHING OR DID SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE REGRETTED. I called him later and apologized but said How do you think that is right to do what you did? No reponse."
989,2,"I am very disappointed with Comcast High Speed internet service. For the past month as they have transitioned from @ Home to Comcast I have had nothing but problems. It is difficult to ever reach a customer service rep and when you do they often are unable to help or simply put you on hold again to transfer you somewhere else. I have spent the past month trying to resolve problems with them with no success. They refuse to schedule a technician to come to my home. I have been unable to receive e-mail for the past week now. However their bills always come on time. I transitioned to this service for quicker connection to the internet. I transitioned from AOL and swapped quality for speed. Now I am paying over $50 per month for internet service that only works half the time. I have lost address books, files and never received countless emails because of the poor service of this company. I wish I could tell them to go to hell but they don't answer the phone."
990,1,"I am Writing to report a company called Credit Service. I called their toll free number, (888) 808-8501, to get a loan by mail for my husband (Bruce) and I. The number stated that I should send a copy of his check stub along with a $35 processing fee and they would send a response in as little as 10 business days and your filing fee is refundable. They sent me information on 2 other loan companies which wasn't what I was expecting and not what their toll free number stated. I sent all their information back and requested a refund, I never got it. What I got was a letter basically stating that they didn't appreciate my threatening letter to report them and that false information was libel. How funny. Give that number a call and see how you perceive it. And, if you can, I would like to know what to say or do to get my money back."
991,1,Their leads are picked off the tree out back. They lied about the competition I was gonna have. They were rude and didn't care for any of my suggestions on how to fix this problem. They stole money out of my account after I repeatedly told them they had no authorization from me to do that. I have personally spoke to other contractors in my field and they also also stated to me that they felt ripped off. I did not provoke them into saying that. I find that they don't care about your business and they will charge many many other contractors other than the two plus me I was promised just so they can bilk your account for the eleven dollars a so called lead. They do it rapidly too. You get a lead and it is a dead lead or has nothing to do with your business and they charge you in a matter of days and if you have the need to have it credited they will deny your request. I signed up for this for extra business and it cost me aggravation and a sick feeling of being taken for a ride. How the hell can they get away with that. When will their shady business tactics catch up with these crooks.

993,3,"On May 23rd I went the to the ARCO on Lancaster Drive NE and told the attendant to put in $20.00 in gas in my vehicle. When I went into to pay for the gas I notice the attendant had wrote down $40.00 and not twenty like I had told him. By the time that I was able to stop the attendant he had already put in over twenty dollars of gas in the vehicle. When I confronted him he called me a LAIR and said that I was forbidden to come to his gas station again. I am on a limited income and can not afford to pay for extra gas that I did not order. There were other people around the pump and heard how much gas I told the attendant to put in. I had to pay the extra amount because they would not take my word and the word of witness over the attendant. I am short of cash because of this attendant and will have to go without other idems for the rest of the month. The amount of the overage may not seem at much, but to a person on limited income it is the difference between having milk, bread and food."
994,1,"I signed up for att internet service, high speed. First, I had to set up time for them to come and hook up to my phone line, I was originally told I was going to be online then, but phone guy said no, the modem has to come later in the mail. So, ok. I wait and it arrives days later. It comes with CD I have to download to activate service. It took me 2 hours and still did not work. I called customer service who switched me and put me on hold for 15 min. When I finally got someone, it took them 3 more hours and several tries before I finally could go online. I was actually able to use it for one day then nothing. Back to customer service. Told me they have had problems with that type modem and they will have to send me another one - same modem. So I have to take off another day of work. This modem works fine for 2 weeks then, after that, every time i have to use computer, I have to unplug and replough modem. Fine, I did that. My online class starting and said I will just have to put up with anything. Day of my test - no internet. Tried for a week to get online - nothing. AT&T's solution - another modem. I paid for 2 months worth of interned could only get online maybe 10 times. Do not use att for internet. The service and customer service is the worst I have ever dealt with. "
995,3,"In early April, I contacted Verizon's Customer Service Representative to cancel my online service account. In the following month when I checked my phone's bill statement, I noticed that I still get charged for Verizon internet service. I called the Bill/Inquiry Customer Services Department, and a rep transferred me to another department. I spoke to the customer service representative and his Supervisor, and they both informed me that they were unable to remove the charges. Their reason was because there was no record in the system of my cancellation; therefore, they are unable to do anything for me. I told them that I spoke to a Verizon's Customer Service Representative, and that my account should have been canceled. I shouldn't be charged for a service that I have already canceled a month ago. After speaking to them, I realized that it was not going any way, and that I needed to speak to their manager instead. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to at that time but I will later on. It is not my responsibility that the company hired an incompetent customer service representative who is unable to do what was requested of her. I am surely not the one at fault, and the company should take full responsibility for this situation."

I figured I could get the smog now and the oil change later due to time constraints. Well, after getting the Smog Check, MR HARRY (not so HERO), went ahead and did the SMOG, little did I know it wasn't going to pass because of the service engine light. He told me for $75 he could do the diagnostic (a discount - BS), I told him what needed to be done. Well, you owe me $45 for a Failed Smog he stated. Your engine light is on and that always fails. He told me after the fact he did the smog and he saw the light go on and off, which I stated prior to the smog and told him about my time constraints!

I have worked for this business, brought MANY years of revenue and several recommendations to friends, colleagues, etc. My most recent visits to this shop was performed poorly; with both shoddy work, incorrect parts and a window that STILL does not work right. After receiving a call a month later from the owner Dave, after an alternator install and having a belt squeal after antifreeze was split on it per Pete the mechanic; and being told it'll go away, it got worse. I was told to bring the car back and he'd check and/or replace the belt. To my shock, I received a call from Dave looking for $$ for the belt! I then expressed my displeasure with the past few repairs done on my car, and several repeat visits --- I was then told to go someplace else NOT a good way to KEEP business! Stay FAR away!!!!!!!!!!"

They wouldn't download so after spending money on getting my computer checked out and going back and forth with my computer guy, he recommended I call Hughes Net. I, at that point, found out that I have a limited data plan. There was no mention of this when I signed on, I am sure of that. I know what that means, and I wouldn't have done it. So after you have used your data, which is very limited, then you have to buy more data at $10.00 a shot. To cancel this policy Hughes Net would charge me $400.00. This company has false advertising and does not give you information that you need when signing up. I would never use this company again and will pay the $400.00 to get another internet provider."
999,1,"I was in an accident in April 2013. I took my truck to Service King On advice from my insurance company. When I picked it up, Jason (my rep.) pulled the truck around, got out and said the check engine Light came on, since the truck is new Ford probably knows what the issue is and since it is under warranty why don't you take it in and have them fix it. I should have refused delivery, but I thought he was trustworthy and saido When I took it to Ford they said the main wiring harness was damaged and a wire had been cut. This caused a sensor to not read properly and made the check engine light come on. I called Jason and he said bring it in. When I took in, He looked at it, denied they had anything to do with the damage. He had his shop foreman look at it and he agreed. They then assured me that they would take care of the issue. He told me he was going to talk to the insurance co. and would call me back that afternoon. He has NEVER called me back or responded in any way. I have since taken it up with my insurance co. and my insurance co.  fixed the problem. Service King seems to deal with problems by ignoring the customer completely. If Service King did not want to fix the problem They Caused, Jason could have been man enough to at least call me and tell me!! This was a new truck that had never been worked on, until they got their hands on it. I will never use this co. again and will always tell everyone I know to BEWARE!!!!!"
1000,1,"Anyone interested in cheap internet ... STAY AWAY FROM JUNO INTERNET THEY ARE RUNNING A SCAM. They buy you off by starting you off with DSL for 20 bucks a month. Then they bring it up to about 36 dollars a month. Finally, when you need them to come through like when you are moving to another location with a different telephone number, they tell you that they cannot help you because their service is only programmed to work with the telephone number that was originally provided. So then you have no other choice but to cancel the service and pay 100 bucks no matter how much you tell them that you are going to take your business elsewhere because they make you have a one year contract with them. The funny part about this is that they rarely mention this to you when you first hook up the internet, and they don't put this in writing for the customer to be able to reference it back in the future. (I thoroughly looked through their terms of service and no where does it say that should I move I would be subject to the cancellation fee) Then they have the nerve to ask me if I want to reinstall the internet service and pay everything like brand new. I, of course became extremely irritated when they asked me this and then the guy continued to try and sell me more Juno products by telling me that they will give me a month free. MONTH FREE!!!! Month free my big fat foot!!!!! Juno you could just take your business and shove it because I decided to go with Verizon. THEY ARE CHEAPER AND MORE RELIABLE YOU PIECES OF CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!"

They sent me an e-mail with additional information on my order. The item I ordered was out of stock.... BUT IT WAS IN STOCK WHEN I ORDERED IT. I figured they either weren't keeping track of their stock, their website wasn't up to date, or they decided to ship orders placed after mine.
They told me it'd take an additional 7-10 days (it took them 8) and I received my package 11 days after the e-mail correspondence. At that point, I didn't even want the shirt anymore but nonetheless I opened the package and went to try it on. The stitching is misaligned, parts of the shirt aren't even stitched and the parts that are - the threading is already coming undone.

I ordered my items 5 WEEKS AGO and nothing has come in. i've called them multiple times asking where they are and they told me they sold me items that are out of stock. i'm completely disgusted with the way the costumer service handled this situation, they are so rude and only tell you what u see on your account. i'm still in shock how a brand can be so unprofessional to sell people items that are out of stock."

1005,1,So when Target promises you a date that allows you to get your package in time for your big event don't believe them. They missed the delivery date for Christmas. Then they tell you to please accept our apologies and that you will be getting a gift certificate. When the gift certificate actually came through--A whooping $5. Why bother! You might as well send me nothing and let me know you don't give a $#*! about me.
1006,2,"I will never use Romwe again. After placing two separate orders I was requested to send documentation proving that I'm the owner of the card. I spoke with a rep via chat since they do not have a phone number and provide the required documentation. She started that the information will get to the required party to release my orders. The issue is that one of my orders was sent and the other cancelled. I get an email saying that my order was cancelled bc I didn't proved the necessary verification. Now some of the kids received there package and the others didnt. To have disappointed children over the holiday was a horrible feeling. Furthermore if they did not receive the documentation why was one package sent?
Even the chat representative appeared to be annoyed when I spoke to her and end the chat abruptly after receiving the documentation. For me customer service is everything.
I sent them an inquiry asking why one of my orders was cancelled while the other was sent. Waiting for an answer but I won't hold my breath."
1007,1,"I ordered a winter jacket and wore it 3 times before I put it on again and when putting my arm in the sleeve i heard a tear and the jacket teared in 3 spots by the shoulder.

1010,1,"I bought two expensive dresses, both horrible and of terrible quality, one of them was so ugly that I never used it and the other one after two months of use and after 5 or 6 sunsets, it broke and the fabric was stunk. I do not recommend this store. I did not make the refund because I made thepurchase from Mexico and paying the shipping and the customs expenses was very expensive. Zero recommendable."
1011,1,"Most of their items are made in low-wage countries, the quality is poor and won't lost. For the price, I would also expect the items to arrive on time and be the correct size. I ordered a shirt for a trip to Italy, it arrived after 3 weeks two sizes too big. I didn't have time to exchange it before mg trip. They refunded me, however without the shipping cost . They gave me a $15 credit, which is abysmal when considering it wouldn't include free shipping. This company is not worth it, cheap, overly trendy garbage that will last you maybe one season if you're lucky."
1012,1,"First of all, most of the items I got from this website don't look like the photos they show. A lot cheaper materials like made in China but I only bought all that they state as ""made in Korea"" and the price is like $100 for two pieces. But they come to me like trash and they die after one wash. A total rip off.
Secondly, it took them almost 2 weeks just to send out to ship your items. Yes almost 2 weeks!!!! so by the time you get your stuffs, that could be 3-4 weeks.
Thirdly, they charged my card with some foreign transaction, but they promoted themselves as in the US. Scam!
And finally, they shipped me a wrong color of the item and tried to accuse me in the wrong. I showed then the proof, but they still reject to give me refund on my credit card but they insist me to ship it back to them with my own money for postage and they will only give back stock credit.
This website is a complete scam!!!!! I already reported them to my card company!"

It took way to long and the site and process was very glitchy. Overall this was a bad experience and in the end I found out the site didn't even make me a member. Will not be buying from this company ever again.
1014,1,"It was a real disaster I ordered from them last year 2 product with the standard shipping. I was refunded on only 1 and it wasn't a total refund and it was credits on the website! I precisely said to be refunded on my bank account! Customer service will not even help you through the process it will do the bare minimum, and I think they did the bare minimum cause I did complaint on Paypal !
I'm attempting 1 last try this month with the tracked shipping which I paid for ! If it doesn't get to my house in 1 month I will do a reclaim on Paypal, and I'll just refuse their ""yesstyle credit"". I wouldn't recommend this website to my worst enemy."
1015,2,I placed an order on Ann Taylor and forgot to include a unit number of the address. I called immediately and was told there was nothing they could do to help me. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was put on hold and then told there was no supervisor. She then hung up on me. I am a prolific on-line shopper and had been a loyal Ann Taylor customer. That will be my last purchase with them.
1016,1,"When I placed an order for one pair of pants, Ann Taylor hit my bank account 5 separate times for the same purchase amount leaving me with $1.26 in my bank account. I suspect if I had more funds in my checking account, they would have gone for much more. When I called Ann Taylor they told me that it was my mistake, that I must've left my shopping cart, or had an error on my end.
I had one submit and one confirmation email from Ann Taylor with the correct amount so I never thought to look for numerous duplicate charges to my bank account. I got off the phone with Ann Taylor feeling violated.
Ann Taylor's customer service told me they would not refund the 4 other single line item charges for 5 to 10 business days. They were rude, dismissive and nasty to me. My bank should have stopped the hit after hit after hit -- numerous identical charges, but they did not. They did, however, reverse the charges on Ann Taylor.
This conduct, on the part of Ann Taylor, constitutes fraud. I suspect they did this to thousands of online customers in order to finance a failing clothing business."
1017,2,"I used to love the clothes, but be careful if you need to return something. I wore a pair of cotton pants once, washed according to the instructions and they came out looking shabby. The local store in Stamford, CT refused to take them back. I had to return at a cost of $7.95 through the mail. The local manager was rude - she actually said that she couldn't take them back because she couldn't resell them - no joke, the pants are defective, why is reselling a condition of returns? I will never buy from Ann Taylor again.
Also - I wrote this review of the pants I bought and Ann Taylor has not posted it!"
1018,1,"Bought a shirt from the Singapore store, flew it back home and it developed 2 small holes, albeit reparable with some thrifting. Ironed it and suddenly there was a massive non-reparable hole. Didn't even wear it once. Waste of money. Found out about all its controversy and racial discrimination lawsuit after so it's about time this store needs to shut down and gtfo anyway."
1019,1,"I've been a customer of A&F since I was a kid and due to the employee attitude over the phone as well as stores I stopped shopping at some point. Now that am an adult after a long time I tried to buy couple of shirts for my cousin. A very simple order was delivered with incorrect color and size.The invoice says one thing and the actual order is different. Tried calling customer service; forget it, an horrible human being on the other side of the phone. Better have a robot. Someone need to remind the employee that your job is to serve customers. Wonder why this company didn't go bankrupt?? It will soon!!!"
1020,2,stupid online customer service employees that I ever see. Abercrombie hire all stupid employees. They can not solve any problems. I ordered only 2 items and add two more item but they can not work out and place wrong price and charge my bank wrong number with receipts. I tried to contact 4 peoples but all stupids. They have not responsibility what they did. they even do not what they are doing. no anyone know how to say sorry what they did wrong. Their attitude is very terrible service. I will like to shop at good service even more expensive than stupid service. I never go back even your clothes is good or cute . I do not care. Amazon is best service.
1021,3,One of the worst customer service I have experienced. When you call them.theh have such cold answers that you would think why did you even call. I placed my order a d it's been 7 days it's showing label created . REALLY ?? why you will not ship it ? It should have arrived by now and still sitting at their warehouse.
1022,3,"Recently I prurchased five items from the online sale, and one product was over sold. They sent me an email asking if I would like a similar product instead. After several messages later they stated it's no longer available even though they asked me for further details. They could've simply stated all the products were no longer available instead of wasting my time."
1023,3,So my shipping address and billing address are different. Somehow my billing address was filled in for both once I placed the order. I immediately realized what had happened and emailed customer service. They said they would do their best to fix it. They did not. They said I would receive an update in a couple days. I also did not. When I emailed someone about it later on and they just basically said oops too late it was already shipped. So now my item is in Canada and the post office there probably wont hold on to it until I'm back in Canada. I've had better customer service from Romwe.
1024,1,"She had been wearing the dress on for an hour when the zipper broke, the dress (strapless, obviously depends on a working zipper) split open, beyond repair. She had to use five safety pins to keep it together and wear her date's jacket for the remainder of the evening. And no, the dress was not tight, on the large side, if anything. I AM BEYOND DISGUSTED! This company targets young women with cheaply made, over-priced clothing that can't make it through one night. SHOP AT WALMART, IT WILL BE BETTER QUALITY. I would have given the dress zero stars if that were an option. I will never purchase from REVOLVE again. Oh, also paid $60 to have the dress hemmed. Extra bonus for being a big enough idiot to shop at Revolve."
1025,3,"I have been on maternity leave since Nov 11th, and I ordered some clothes because I LOVE your merchandise. Everything I have ever bought, I adore. HOWEVER, the company you ship through never gave me any notice that it was delivered.. nothing on my door, no knock on my door. Nothing. I paid with Afterpay, so I figured perhaps I had to pay for it all before I got it though I did write an email saying ""hey, I never got this stuff yet"". It was around $300 worth of stuff, that never showed up. Another company, that uses ""On Tracking"" did not show up either and I am super upset because I ran around town looking for my stuff an no one has been helpful. When I called no one was helpful, and they told me I wouldnt get a refund because ""it said that it had been delivered"" and that was it. Someone stole my stuff, I am sure or it got lost and IM LIVID. I am a single mom, with a newborn sitting here waiting for lazy carriers who probably dropped it off somehwere else. BULL$#*! terrrible terrible vc."
1026,1,"I am attending a few weddings and ordered 4 dresses.
It was mentioned ""NEW 3 DAYS FREE DELIVERY TO THE UK FOR ALL ORDERS OVER £70"" i spent a thousand pound , as soon as ordered i received confirmation saying i will receive the following week : delivery 7 days later ! I emailed them explaining the situation as i am leaving on these weddings before the delivery I have emailed every day, several times a day, tried to do live chat, tried to call. No one is responding to me, no one is helping me and my order 5 days later has still not left the retailer. 3 DAYS SHIPPING ? ARE YOU KIDDING ME !
A thousand pound later i am not yet to see my order neither to receive an answer, and will have to spend more money to buy new dresses without even a refund.
I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A BAD EXPERIENCE , I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED SUCH A AWFULL AND USELESS CUSTOMER SERVICE.
They sell lie and are thief !
DO NOT TRUST THEM OR BUY FROM THEM !!"
1027,2,I ordered from the US website instead of Canadian website by mistake and they basically told me too bad when I asked if I can return the items. What company these days don't accept returns? Absolute joke of a company who couldn't care less about their customers. Never will order from them again but I'm sure they don't care.
1028,3,"I ordered 3 shirts for my husband for Christmas and it must have been lost in the mail. UPS said it was delivered to my address but I never received it. I receive multiple packages daily and have never had an issue. I called customer service the next day and they told me they have been having issues with packages saying they were delivered but they weren't and to wait a week and call back. Unfortunately, the package never showed up and my husband did not receive his Christmas gifts. I called customer service and was able to reorder one of the shirts (which I received after Christmas) but the other two had sold out. I was refunded my money on the package that was never delivered. However, yesterday morning a month and a half after this ordeal happened I received an email saying I was going to be charged for the package that was not delivered because on their end UPS had marked it as ""delivered"". I called urban customer service and was told that I would have to deal with UPS and it's not your problem it's my problem to deal with. The two women I spoke to, a customer service rep and a supervisor were so condescending and rude and would not help me with this situation at all. If you were to look at my track record and see how much money I spend in urban monthly and how I have never had an issue with lost mail, and how I actually reordered one of the shirts I never received you would think the company would let me keep my reimbursement. This is the worst customer service I have ever received and i am basically being accused of fraud with no merit. I ended up calling my bank and issuing a charge back and opening up a case with them. I received an email today from urban outfitters basically telling me that I am banned from shopping there until they receive $104.00 from me. If I place an order they immediately be cancled. What a joke!!! If they look at my track record of how much money I spend there they are really losing a lot of money. This has been the worst customer service experience I have ever had from a company. Such BS!!"
1029,1,THEY EAT YOUR MONEY! Be carefull! I bought couple of things in November and they never shipped it to me!! I got an confirmation email for one of them and I never got it! So I called and said that I have not recived two items on my list and they did not refund me back one of them becausethey said that 30 days past! They have not sent me any shipping conformation amail for the other items how should i know that you sent it to me?!! NOT RELIABLE AND WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! They do not care! Not at all! Do not trust this company!
1030,1,"Overpriced and overrated food. Chipotle, exciting and new, come aboard, were expecting you. Love, life's sweetest reward, let the Hersey squirt and runs flow, and it floats back to you...
I would NOT recommend this eatery, but ONLY if you're adventurous, go for it!"
1031,3,"I am writing this letter in regard to bring your attention to a serious issue I had with your establishment about a month ago. I ordered a chicken burrito, and halfway through my meal, I bit into what turned out to be a little clump of hair.
I am not the type of customer that wants to make a big deal over things that I understand can happen in the workplace, especially in the food industry, which I have been a part of for many years. I mentioned there was hair in my burrito and the workers offered to make me another one. I declined because at that point I was not really in the mood for a burrito anymore.
I can say that I am I particularly regular customer at your restaurant, and I have never had any problems with your food, other than this incident. While I am relatively certain that this was possibly a fluke, I am still concerned how this clump of hair got into one of the items I had asked to be put into my burrito. I am curious of how this could have happened.
I am also concerned with the lack of concern I received from the staff. I believe that just offering the same replacement menu item after something like this happens is not very acceptable. At that point, I would like to have been given a gift card or voucher so that the next time I came into our restaurant, I would have a free meal and better experience. Most customers, including myself are not interested in eating something that was just impaired.
I did not make any more fuss about the burrito, and just said that I did not want something else instead. I have other friends that are also regular customers at your establishment have the same issues every once in a while. I thought I would make it known that we enjoy your food, and would like to bring our business back, knowing that this issue will hopefully be addressed.
I hope to hear back from you about this incident soon. I would really appreciate some feedback on how to address situations like mine in the future to make customer experience better at your establishment! Please contact me at your earliest convenience at (412)-913-7305 or email me at aleciafolino14@gmail.com.
With Kind Regards,
Alecia Folino."
1032,3,"Had and am still lovin' Chipotle! The food is awesome and their team is constantly keeping up to date with what works and what doesn't. The only issue I have with Chipotle is the occasional bad customer service. It's a hit or miss! Specifically, I'm talking about the Chipotle by Washington Ave SE I frequent in Minneapolis. I know they are college students but a little bit of smile and vibes of sincere happiness can go a long way."
1033,2,"My coworkers and I placed an order to Pizza Hut off of south John young and Americana. That was around 2:20pm. We asked for delivery and got everything confirmed. We've ordered here before and the driver took awhile the first time so we thought this time would be different. I called again right after getting off the phone at 2:30 because the total seemed off with the special they offered. After they corrected it we waited and an hour passed so I called back. The person who answered said ""oh your ticket asked for carry out"". I asked to speak to the manager. The manager was not at all helpful and one can tell over the phone that he didn't want to put any blame on his shop. He said you were read the wrong ticket. The pizza was picked up at 3:03 and I have my best driver in route. At about 3:35 the pizza arrived after I told him we wanted a refund. The delivery guy was the same guy as last time. Not a great delivery guy. He complained about not being able to find our store in the mall after coming here last time. After opening up the orders they were WRONG! I called back and spoke to the manager. I said we want a refund. He said you can get a credit but we will make it and bring it back in 45 mins!!!!! Are you $#*!ting me?!? I said no! We want a refund. He says well I'm sure in your store you can't refund a product without having the product here. I said we are sending it back with your driver so we want a refund. That manager was a $#*!!!!! Never ever ordering there ever again!!!!!!!"
1034,1,"They charge $1.50 for ""extra cheese"" and never really put extra on. They say they meet some kind of standard, but at Domino's, you can pay for AND GET extra cheese. Also the last time I ordered delivery, the guy spilled an entire container of sauce (not in my order) on my porch and barely apologized! The store offered $5 off a pizza order, hardly worth my time, money, no cheese, stupid delivery people, pizza. CALL DOMINO'S OR DOWNLOAD THEIR APP!!! Marco's is also good! Plenty of cheese!"
1035,3,"The pizza is fresh, but by the time you get it! The website tells you it'll get to you in a certain amount of time, but it never does. It can take up to 2 hours to get to you on a weekend day. Customer service is pretty bad and they don't do refunds or at least I wasn't given one when I asked for one after waiting for a pie for 2 hours."
1036,3,"Gross would not aptly describe how disgusting the food was: stale muffin, uncooked sausage, old food. Terrible odor. McDonald's is a case study in end-stage capitalism. No one thinks the food is edible but they survive because it has nothing to do with demand - they're too big to fail."
1037,2,I went inside McDonald's in avondale. Asked 4 different employees could someone plz come clean the table I was sitting at with my grandaughter. Only to see no one was coming to clean off tables. I cleaned the table off myself after I had purchased $14.00 worth of food and drinks for my grandaughter. When I contacted the corporate office they sent me a free meal coupon.WOW after paying $14.00 for me and my granddaughter something to eat and had to clean my own table off. This is pothetic!!! Will take my money and business elsewhere!!!
1038,3,"Took my grandkids to McDonald's yesterday and the tables and high chairs were so filthy it was disgusting! I literally had to clean everything and wipe everything down bc it was so covered with food and residue from the past uses.
I live in a small town and our McDonald's is Directly by a interstate exit in Van Buren, AR. I am embarrassed now that I know people who see that mess will associate it with our town."
1039,2,"I ordered the 5.00 Fillup Pot Pie on Main Street and Lindsey in Mesa, Az. It actually costs 5. 75 plus tax and was the worst pot pie I ever ate. All crust with little inside. 3 pieces of chicken, two carrot pieces and 1 pea. Could not believe my eyes. Like their tiny dwarf chicken pieces with 7 layers of batter. I'm done with KFC."
1040,1,"Hi KFC.
Today I visited KFC ( Mall Road amritsar,Punjab) with my 3 friends. They were my guest. I ordered Wednesday bucket with 10 pieces. When my friend took first piece into bucket that was full of oil. It seems like we r eating jalebi and oil was draining on tray. It was such a very bad experience. And the second piece ( leg piece ) was filled with blood. That piece was not clean proper. We exchanged pieces bt new pieces also was so much oily. So tht was my last visit of KFC. I'll never go KFC again and will tell to my friends to not go. It was bull$#*!."
1041,3,"Dirtier than an out of the way, middle of the night, truck stop wiener roller. I have been in cleaner our houses for bathrooms.Then a small riot broke out near the cooking stations that had us scurrying for cover beneath tables if the floors were so greasy.
Oddly enough the food was as good as it was the last time I was forced to make myself a KFC ""customer""- it's still pretty bad.
Suggestion- Raise and start over."
1042,3,This store has horrible customer service. The acting manager cussed my 17 year old daughter and my husband. Our order was not complete and the manager threw food at my husband as my husband was walking away.
1043,2,"I called the Richland location, after realizing they forgot a burger, to let them know i was on the way for a third time that hour. When i asked to speak to the manager the young lady told me i had the wrong number (which is printed on the receipt) and then hung the phone up on me. The WORST customer service. Will not be returning to any Wendys. It takes one action to put a bad taste in someones mouth."
1044,1,"Wendy's Homestead, PA is the worst chain fast food location I have been to. When I arrived there with my family they messed up all of our orders. I asked for a chicken sandwich with fries and an ice tea, but they only gave me a Baconator. Not only did they mess up my family's order, but they messed up five other peoples' orders who were eating in the fast food restaurant as well. The staff was unorganized and unable to provide proper customer service. The employees in the kitchen laughed as people received their wrong orders. I highly recommend that people stay away from this Wendy's location."
1045,3,We had someone use our account to order food. We called the restaurant the food was supposed to be picked up at and they didn't have any recollection of the ordered placed. The amount was almost $80 and it went through at the bank. Thankfully our bank helped us fix the situation and ordered us a new debit card.
1046,1,"The Taco Bells here in South West Florida are HORRIBLE! Fort Myers/Cape Coral area. The Mexicans have taken over the stores in the Cape and they cater to their kind only! Americans are treated like $#*! while they're giving anyway the farm to their kind. Damn shame! Needless to say, they are not very busy here and for some reason, Corporate doesn't care!
I guess they see it as long as they're making some money, they don't want to rock the boat.
It's sad because I can see the end of them coming soon not unless they make some seriously changes and hire some American people! People that have the company's best interest at heart.
We hadn't been to a Taco Bell here in over a year because of the management or should I say LACK of management/Americans.
This past weekend, we thought we'd give them another chance (because we used to really LOVE Taco Bell) to see if they actually hired some Americans and actually put some food on their products. NOPE! What a big disappointment! This visit just made up our minds to just never give Taco Bell any more of our money! We're done with them. WAY to many other places to eat.
We found a MUCH better place called Tijuana Flats! WAY better than Taco Bell plus you actually have Americans waiting on you that actually give a $#*! about you as a customer. Not to mention you actually get some food!
If I could have given Taco Bell NO STARS I would have! The WORST!"
1047,1,"We don't have a TB close by so after weeks of waiting to make the 1 hr drive to town we stopped at one of the many local TB's and I purchased the Volcano Box to get an entry into the Gold PS4 giveaway.
The food was as usual, alright, skimpy but tasteful and overpriced. We got our box and after several stops, shopping and Dr's appt., we finally headed home.
The next day we decided to text our code as required and did we get a shock. After inputting the code we immediately got a response to verify our age was over 18 and we replied yes. We then quickly received the following: "" Looks like the code you entered is not valid or has already been used. Check code and try again. Msg&Date Rates may apply. Send STOP to end, send HELP for help."" message!!!
WHAT? I just entered my code and it's not valid and / or been used, WTF?
Needless to say I've contacted TB numerous times and all I keep getting in return is how my code is randomly chosen that every 10 minutes for someone to win the PS4. Doesn't a person have to have a valid code to even enter? YES but they can't get past the part that my code was NOT VALID and refused to send me another and / or enter me into the drawing. Now I realize they probably get a lot of scammers but I have kept the proof on my phone and email contact and TB is a SCAM....
I will never pay extra again to play a fast food restaurant game, regardless of the name, and I hope others will think twice, report these kind of fraud scams, or employees who rip off customers by using codes and letting others know of these fake wins.
I am not 20 or 17 to scam and shocked by the rude attitude of TB employees at their website contact to work to resolve my issue. They show no consideration or concern for any of the paying public and wish to ignore any problems.
If anyone would like the completed transcript or copy of phone records to verify this scam it is readily available if I can figure out how to post it. Otherwise I will be posting everywhere so others can or will speak out against these games."
1048,3,"Me and my friends went there recently and we were not impressed. Long wait, horrible service and the food was mediocre. The salad tasted very bad. The staff was not knowledgeable about items that were new and she was pretty rude. Disappointed."
1049,2,"On October 14th I had a party of 10 go to olive garden for my daughters birthday. They had 2 servers helping our table but it was more like 1. One would take all the orders the other would bring them to the table. It started off with the seating.
We got there knowing we would wait for a table with a large group. They didnt tell us half the party had to arrive be fore they would seat us. Only after they seated a party of 7 20 minutes after we arrived did we learn this.
They waitresses took our drink order and got us incorrect drinks. After that they took our food orders and wrote my order down wrong. Instead of fixing it (I ordered the unlimited pasta) they showed me what she wrote down. I left it alone. I wanted a second bowl but after they served our food my drink never got refilled and they never came back. We had to ask other servers for to go boxes. And then we had to ask other servers to get our bill split correctly. It was very disappointing. I have had questionable service before but I have never felt like an annoyance or a nuisance at the restaurant that my daughter insists on going to at least once a month.
I will seriously reconsider going there anytime in the near future. I get better service from our fast food places."
1050,2,"It's funny how past events at restaurants can put such a bad taste in your mouth that you won't go back.
I ate at our local Olive Garden about a year ago but a few years before that I had such bad service that I just don't want to pay for that. It's not cheap for the microwave dinner and when a grumpy old woman serves everyone around you and you wait almost a hour for your menu (I had to get up from the table and physically get in her way to just ask her for a menu and maybe a glass of water) you just don't want to do that again."
1051,3,"I received a $25 egift card for Dunkin Donuts for my entries on my coke rewards. I added the card to my Dunkin account and transferred the money to my existing Dunkin card. It should the updated amount.
When I went to use it, the $25 was not on the card. Okay.
I requested Coke Rewards to send me a new card and got basically ""NOT OUR ISSUE"" as a response. Dunkin gave me the same response. Having been in IT for years reputable vendors log ALL transactions so it should be doable under those circumstances.
I'll make sure I keep egift cards longer from now on."
1052,1,"I just found out that when Dunkin makes your drinks, like iced coffee among other things they WILL STIR YOUR DRINK. They will also stir other people's drink that are coming from home with a mug/thermos WITH THE SAME $#*!ING SPOON. UNSANITARY & DISGUSTING. I will now be spending my money at Starbucks or another coffee shop with cleaner practices."
1053,3,"I know I should not expect much from iHop, their menu is a corporate committee decision implemented by the lowest bidder. They have a promise that is undelivered. I've visited iHop scantly over the 40years and always have an unremarkable experience. I typically visit after I've forgotten the previous experience. I think iHop has this idea that bland dishes, with scant seasoning is a good way to save costs and salt, pepper and a few bottles of hot sauces is sufficient to compensate for blandness. My most recent experience was particularly marginalizing and unsatisfying. Here's list of issues I called out on the survey from the receipt.
1. I asked for a quite location, I was seated at a table in the center of the restaurant that became progressively louder.
2. The bathroom was disheveled, toilet seat detaching.
3. No posted wifi password and because the room was so loud, could not accurately hear the staff I asked for it.
4. No place to secure my bicycle, I had to use unoccupied outside benches.
5. I was not asked if I was an club member.
6. Low menu diversity and unsatisfying menu options, and customizing what I wanted was going to cost more than I wanted to pay.
7. Low flavor meal, the water had more taste than the sandwich, all I could detect was the American cheese. The bread looked nice.
8. Plugged shakers, the pepper was coarser than the openings in the top, I had to unscrew the top to be able to add it to my meal.
9. Scant and paltry sides and add-ins. for $1 extra I got tablespoon of mushrooms added to the sanwich, the onions and mushrooms were only sufficient to be symbolic. I think there was meat in the sandwich. The hash-browns were as thin as a veneer, barely browned and smaller than the the bread.
10. The onion rings were low flavor, under cooked and had a pasty texture and flour flavor. I ate only one.
11. waitress did not ask me about the onion rings when she cleared the table.
12. The register receipts print poorly and are difficult to read, the paper fades quickly shows stains prominently.
13. The waitress did not respond when I bid here good evening.
14. Not enough time to finish issue listing or enough text to list all issues."
1054,2,"Everytime I have mistakenly given IHOP a chance in the last decade I am disappointed beyond belief. I have never once sat down, ordered, and actually eaten within an hours time frame. It seems across the board the only requirement to work here is being more lazy than the last person. Across 4 states, probably 10 cities there is not one location I would revisit. Just plain ridiculous for an old-school name to have fallen this far."
1055,3,I walked in and ordered a Belgium Waffle Combo and paid via debit card at IHOP 00939 located at 12623 Norwalk Blvd in Norwalk Ca. I waited 45 minutes and they did not deliver so I asked for my money back and they refused. The Manager (Mark Romero) is inconsiderate toward customers and would not give me the franchise owners phone number so I could complain! Another gentleman ahead of me waited an hour to receive his food and he complained also to no avail. When I asked for my money back he offered me a rain check to come back at a later time!
1056,2,I took my daughter to Dairy Queen in Silverdale WA. Ridge top Blv. 01/28/2019 The reception we received upon entering was non existent. We actually walked up to the counter where a employee was standing doing some kind of paperwork. She did not notice us at all. I finally stated to my daughter that we would go somewhere that we would be appreciated us as paying customers and have some kind of customer service. She did not even look up. (How Sad) any way I would reconsider going to this particular Dairy Queen Mark A Venezia
1057,3,"Has anyone ordered one of these lately ?? Hot summer decided it was a good treat, the package changed, so you get less. The top does not close correctly, the ""ice cream"" tasted like frozen skim milk (no flavor). I am guessing the syrup toppings are supposed to make the flavor? The banana was buried under the globs could not tell if it was fresh kinda yellow looking like frozen. Either way for 4.39 it was horrific, after 2 bites it went directly into the drain. I would have taken it back, but company present does not take anything back."
1058,3,"I went to the Dairy Queen website and ordered a birthday cake. I was emailed a specific, priorly agreed upon time to pick up the cake--two days later at 2:00 PM. I showed up on that day, and they said they had not received my order. Not only that, they couldn't make the pretty cake for me that was pictured on their site.
Too many companies these days take online orders and then ""pretend"" they didn't receive the order. They they look at you, like, ""Why were you stupid enough to order from us online instead of in person?"" (They don't really say that, but you can tell they're thinking it.)"
1059,1,Ordered food which arrived late and cold. Whilst it was Just Eat that had taken payment they refused to give a refund. Instead they told me to read their terms and conditions which they claim gave them the right not to return my money. Customer service was rude and unhelpful. Cut out Just Eat and order from the restaurant direct.
1060,2,"Abysmal is putting it nicely!!! Ordered two box meals and some extra's tottaling to £30 my meal and the extra's arrived but my partners meal didn't, so he didn't eat anything. After several phone calls and finally speaking to managers, all they could offer was measly refund for that one missing meal. And to top it off the manager Rebecca was extremely rude on the phone, saying we should of gone and get ourselves. wished I would of now. Just eat is appalling at customer service. I know all about customer service and what exactly should of been done as I am a manager in a restaurant myself! If I would of done that as a manger I would of lost my job, and rightly so. How this lady is a 'manager' is beyond me. I have never been so disgusted at the way this has been handled So much inconvenience, for something that should be a relaxing experience of not having anything to worry about! Expect to lose a lot of custom from my local area!"
1061,1,"Furious!!! Take my money but don't deliver-3 seperate times!
I ordered from them on 3 seperate occasions and each time they ring fenced my funds (or pass the buck to the banks) and then say they will deliver the food the NEXT day!! Because the restaurent is closed!! At this moment I have two orders not delivered and moneys taken. I spoke with a person at just eat and they actually say it's my responsibility to check if the restaurent is still delivering! Well don't bloody offer the option of a delivery if you can't do it! But do take my money and ring fence it for 5 days. Absolute trash of a company. Just order direct and save the hastle ppl! Guess what they offered me and I thought ok it may be compensation for the rubbish service, vouchers (I thought well atleast..) but nooo not in compensation but rather in exchange for my ring fenced cash.
Absolutely fuming and I will place this review in as many places as possible"
1062,1,"I have used Expedia in the past and didn't have an issue however, they have changed their policies AND fine print! Buyer BEWARE!! Do not use this service. I lost so much money with this ripoff service. As hurricane Michael moved in they rubbed their hands together at the amount of money they would steal from innocent customers. They kept all my money for airfare and hotels saying they were non- refundable tickets! Really? Eff you Expedia, I've told everyone I know how you steal from hard working Americans. I will never recommend or use another service for travel again. Out 700.$ thanks to a natural occurrence and a crooked business operation. Stay away from these scammers!!!!!"
1063,1,"Last night I made a reservation at a hotel with expedia. I failed to navigate their website successfully and ""somehow"" reserved the hotel for dates that had no relevance to what I ""thought"" I had indicated. I immediately called their customer service line and was kept on hold for over hour while I tried to remedy the situation. After talking to the Service Rep, her boss & a call to Corporate, they were capable of changing my dates but at a surcharge of ~ $30.
I expected them to be a ""service"" company. They are not! Use their site at your peril."
1064,1,"I, like many customers, were sweetened by the free cancellation policy. Yet be aware this is totally subject to airline rules and they would not honor this policy in spite of their own mistakes. A few weeks ago I bought tickets from a cheap airline company in Asia because Expedia is the only website showing the fare was for business class and hence no need to pay for luggage -- cheap airlines have very strict rules and your carry-on luggage cannot exceed 12 kilos. So I was happy to make the purchase. However after I received the itinerary, my ticket was mysteriously changed to economy class. I called them up even if I was out the country, and they acknowledged that it was a technical error, yet they cannot cancel the ticket even if the ticket was booked less than 20 minutes ago. Worse still, when I complained that I would bring up the issue to BBB, the supervisor got very aggressive and eventually offered compensation (less than one-third of what I paid) on promise that I will let the issue rest. So instead of rectifying their mistake, they have no shame in covering up and ribbing off the customers."
1065,2,"Cheapoair has the WORST customer service. We booked our flights for a trip in January 2019. We arrived at the airport to get a call from customer service saying that they didn't confirm our flights and we had no flight booked! We were heading to the Philippines from Canada and had a 24 hr layover in Singapore which we planned to stay the night at a hotel.
This messed up our plans as we had a strict timeline to follow while in the Philippines travelling to other islands (other flights booked to catch).
We spent about 8 hrs on the phone as they kept putting us on hold (20-40 minutes at a time) and transferring us to a supervisor one after the other, all requesting for the same information. 7 hrs on the phone with them meant they didn't rebook us a flight for the same day.
We ended up taking a chance and rebooking with Flighthub to be able to leave on the same day (midnight by then). After another 2 hrs on the phone with them on top of the 7, they finally agreed to refund us our money and gave us $100 credit.
They also suggested we stay in Singapore on stand by eventhough the China eastern flight agent at the airport was explaining to them that we would need the connection flight information or else we will be deported back to Canada. The Cheapoair customer service agent insisted for us to not listen to them and still go on stand by saying they didn't know what they were talking about. Cheapoair customer service agents are willing to tell you anything.
We said we would never book with Cheapoair again but we might as well use the $100 credit, so here I am currently on the phone with them because of course this credit is only redeemable through the phone and it's been 1hr and 11 minutes. And of course I have been transtered 3 times now to a ""supervisor"" that needs to approve this credit. They are making this extremely difficult for us to redeem the compensation for having not even confirming our flights in January leaving us without a flight on a trip that we have been planning for months.
Basically their customer service tactic is to leave you waiting on the phone pissed off for long periods of time until THEY HOPE you (the customer) gets fed up with waiting. Cheapoair DOES NOT HAVE CUSTOMER SERVICE.
It's another 15 minutes has passed and yes I am still on the phone on hold waiting to talk to the ""supervisor"".
Going to flighthub to book my flights instead."
1066,1,Yeah i 'll always advanced people no to get tickets to cheapoair they are the most scammers in the entire world please don't do it it's really sad to see another person that works his or her entire life to have a little vacation and have it screwed but this cheap as unprofessional and scammers company. If i had the opportunity to give them zero reviews i would because they deserve that. So You 'll get treated the way you treat your customers. Who about that people ??.
1067,1,"I foolishly booked airline tickets with cheapoair, assuming they bought blocks of tickets early and sold them at a discount. I just checked flight prices for my flight - directly with United airlines and it is $170 cheaper for each of us just for the flight. The company added an additional $80 fee for booking the flight for us. Do not use this company! Book your flights directly with the airline. I am not looking for a refund. I foolishly approved this without doing my own research. I just wanted to warn others of this scam business. I have included copies of my cheapoair booking below and screenshots taken from United Airlies booking site today."
1068,3,"Agoda cancelled mine booking because their pay system stated that the money was not received or confirmed by their payment partner.
So I went to another Hotel where I could pay in cash.
But later I saw that the money was send to Agoda.
But after 7 e-mails still no answer.
And by calling you are connected to a CD with unpleasant music and no one pick up the phone.
So they get the money. And after that they are unreachable."
1069,2,"Went to book a hotel through Agoda and saw there was a 10% discount code off (what I thought) ANY hotel booking (as the code indicated). I went to book the hotel and the code did not work. I had to book the hotel as I needed it urgently, so assumed that I could just phone up later to make the adjustment.
When I phoned, I was told that the code was invalid, despite it saying it would work on any booking, and when I tried to question it he would not budge or help in any way possible. I thought the point was to provide customer service, and also I think this is misleading and blatently false advertisement. Extremely disappointed and will not be using Agoda again, and I advice you don't either."
1070,1,"Planning legal actions against Agoda but wanted to share my experience with you as well!!
If there is a way I could rate this company less than 1 star I would have opted for it!!
We booked a hotel room for 2 adults and 3 kids, we received a confirmation that clearly states that the booking is confirmed for 2 adultsand 3 kids, when we arrived to the hotel, we've been informed that Agoda only booked a hotel room for 2 adults and 2 kids for our stay. We were left with one kid with no bedding. After spending 2 days in discussion with Agoda customer service and the hotel front desk, Agoda finally sent us an email stating clearly that they are happy for us to book an upgrade to accomodate the 5th person in our party and that they will refund the cost. We explained that the only option that the hotel can offer to accommodate the 5 of us was to book an extra room and Agoda customer service agreed again in writing that they will refund the extra cost upon reception of our invoice. After checking out from the hotel, I sent the invoice as agreed to Agoda with all the required details and an email from the hotel management explaining exactly the situation and the restrictions that they have with the law. Agoda's answer was that we should have accepted to share the 4 beds for the 5 of us and that they will not refund the extra room that they have initially agreed to pay. I am taking the case to court now but wanted to warn you all about this company... Do not deal with them at all unless you want to waste your money.....
Poorest service ever!!!"
1071,1,"NEVER USER THIS COMPANIES SERVICES!!! ASAP Tickets Will not tell you the whole truth about their cancellation fees! If you have to cancel your ticket they will take over half of the ticket fare as ""commission for ITN"". This is even when you buy the travel insurance (That is close to 200 USD) that they say will cover the cancellation. This fee was NEVER explained to us by the sales rep and it was not on any document given to us before we bought the ticket! The Fare cost $1600 USD fare, they took over $740 USD!! The sales agent Never advised us of this service fee if we cancel! The flight was for our nephew in the Philippines to visit us for a month. We had to cancel because our nephew's visa had not been processed on time by the Manila Embassy. My wife was on the phone with there customer service reps and on hold for hours most of the time. She was on the phone from 1 AM to 3 PM. The reps kept on having to end the call because there shift ended. She asked for supervisors but nothing was done. By the end of it my wife was in tears crying because of stress, lack of sleep and disbelieving that a company could be act like this. In the end she was forced to agree to this fee because the flight was only hours away and if she did not cancel we would lose everything!"
1072,2,"The sales are good at selling tickets and prompt to work with. But if you need to make changes or adjustments to your travel, the travel insurance is worthless and the people in the Customer Support area even worse. It is a near-impossible task, days and hours spent on talking to different people each with a different solution, numerous erroneous bank charges, a total nightmare. Enough not to make me want to buy tickets again."
1073,1,"STay away from this ASAP. ticketing agency, a year ago , I response thru advertising thru this agency, got all the info and send emails etc payment went thru, about two weeks before my flight i checked my ticket and it was my lastname was spell wrong only one letter needed to be added , I contacted the people and they have to many excuses sent me a fake letter from United airlines that it can be done the agent should be the one will fix it not the United airlines these thieves conives with lies, fakes people ...we tried to ask for the Manager but couldnt help same person pretending the manager so stressful dealing with these people, never again used this scammers! never get a refund nor the airlines Stay Away ,Stay Away i have research the reviews and ratings its really bad.JAmal Julia, Cedric bunch of phony names with heavy accent all of them. had a nerve to email me hows my flight ... i didnt even had a chance to use my $799.00 ticket."
1074,2,I did not receive a receipt confirming the booking which unfortunately meant i did not see that I had boomed the wrong month. I called to get confirmation and so realised the error only to be told I can't change it. So feel fed up with Alpha rooms.
1075,2,"Alpha rooms stated there was a ""glitch"" in the system and took 400 out of my account which I had not aurthorised. No warning nobody told me till I checked my account later that evening. Rang and customer service was horrible and I did not receive my money for a long time and my mortgage was not paid due to your mistake. Spelled my name wrong and after ringing twice to fix that I'm still called the wrong name.Not a trust worthy company would not book again."
1076,1,"The worse experience we have ever had. We decided to booked our trip with Alpharoom two months in advance to avoid any disappoint. Having booked seperate flights and only 4 days left till departure, I made direct contact with the booked hotel to make a special request for my 6 months pregnant wife and a 2 year daughter to only be notified that we do not have any reservation.
I contacted a member of staff at Alpharoom to look into this, they put me on hold for a very long period passing me on from one member of staff to the other. When finally a manager came on the phone to apologise and tells me there was a technical error and we were booked into the wrong hotel. I was in so much shock and couldn't come to terms with what happened. I could not believe I was not made aware of this until I made contact, we would have turned up to a hotel in a different country just to be turned away after a very long journey.
Initially they told us the hotel was fully booked and then another member of staff told me there was a room available but at a higher cost (which they told me I would have to pay!).
After 3 long days of calling this company being put on hold, being fed lies, telling me no managers were in and then another telling me there were 2 available to speak to me 10 minutes later!!
If this was put right before then I would have been happy but they were not even trying to make this right and just expected me to go and find another hotel myself just 2 days before my flight!
DO NOT USE THIS AGENCY THEY ARE FRAUD!!!!!!

1077,1,"It appears the quality on Kayak has plummeted in the passed year.
They don't seem to verify their sources and I have landed on third party scammer sites. The first time it was a hotel booking, and this time it is a return flight.
Kayak sent me to a ""hacker fare"" site called kiwi. Having trusted Kayak before, I didn't investigate kiwi. My mistake!
Kiwi is a the worst choice to book with. This booking was for a family member who had to travel across the ocean after her mom suddenly passed away... Now, in the most distressed situation, already at her destination, this family member has to deal with some sort of fishy process that was not required for the purchase of the ticket to get there. Kiwi is holding her money, but not issuing a tixk we t under the guise of a verification process, which cannot be completed because the site freezes. When attempting to call, she had to wait 50 minutes, and on minute 48 the connection dropped....
So, at this point, Kayak cannot be trusted for its recommendations.
I will no longer be using Kayak.
Stay away from Kiwi! ( That will be a separate review.)"
1078,1,Kayak.com sucks when it comes to doing their job. Do not book a car with them or with Dollar/Thrifty. I wish i could give a zero and not a 1 for ratings. Poor customer service on both ends. Gave me this around Kayak that Dollar owed me the refund then Dollar same thing on no Kayak owe you the refund. I would suggest dealing with the actual car rental company like Enterprise etc but don't book with a third party. From personal experiences. Second time trying Dollar car rental. Never again... You have been warned..
1079,1,"Kayak.com essentially is a deceptive advertising platform for shady booking companies to blend in with legit airlines to fleece unsuspected travelers with 'cheap fares' schemes. Booking companies like Vayama and kiwi.com can become a thorn in your travel experience. They ""partnered"" with Kayak.com to get customers but they provide no real customer service. These booking companies have hidden fees that make it very unwise to use them. And Kayak.com facilitates all this. Just stay away from Kayak.com to save yourself money, headache, and suffering."
1080,3,I buy a tickets with insurance and nobody told me it didn't go throw for more than 2weeks and when I call them they cancelled my insurance and they told me I DIDNT CHECKED AND I CALLED LAST MINUTE SO I NEED TO CALL INSURANCE COMPANY. AND WHEN YOU BUY YOUR TICKETS YOU WILL GET RESERVATION NUMBERS FOR EACH AIRLINE BUT WHEN I CALL THEM THEY SAID I NEED TO CALL THE AIRLINE TO FIND IT OUT! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS REALLY BAD AND EVEN SUPERVISOR SAYING SAMETHING AS OTHER AGENT USELESS. I TRIED TO SAVE $100 and I got 3days headache and they are asking to choose the seat it's doesn't work you need to choose again with airline now I need to seat at the middle of 3seats.
1081,1,"I booked a flight to Doha via Aire fare network. They took my money but cancelled my flight without informing me.
I only realised when I tried to check in the day before my flight. The staff were unhelpful in rebooking the flight and they would lie a lot. I was on hold for around 7 hours trying to sort this out.
DONT NOT BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY THEY ARE LIARS!!!!"
1082,2,"I booked my tickets this morning and they said it had been reserved but then at half five as I was leaving work they tell me they tried to call me (they hadn't) and to call them back. They'd cancelled my booking because apparently the price was rejectwd by the airline (don't know how that happens). Anyway they tell me the price is now £100 more, as he asks for more money I look up the price on skyscanner and see not only are they advertising less from airfare network (£540) but so are their competitors, so obviously I have no trust for these guys, cancelled the booking."
1083,3,"Unbelievable, they charged me for the insurance which i didnt add on. And COULDNT SHOW ANY PROOF OF INSURANCE PURCHASE.
Tried to tell them that i didnt add it. The latest itinerary was emailed on 15 March, the insurance was still appeared as recommendation.
They showed me their record of debiting my card for insurance on the 17MARCH which proved NOTHING as it just their system record.
The most ridiculous thing is, i CANCELLED my booking on 17 March so how could i add insurance on the same day as their record of debiting money from my card???
IN CASE I DID add insurance on 17 March, i believed OneTravel might have sent me an email. But only cancellation emails sent on that day.
The reprentative who chatted with me stopped without any reason when i asked for itinerary showed clearly insurance was added on.
I believed One Travel tried to take money from me in that way. So disappointed."
1084,2,"This website is absolute trash. Their customer service is absolutely terrible.
I booked a flight on the 23rd of December, and received a confirmation booking number, which I took a screenshot of and I thought I was done.
I thought everything was good to go, and I could breathe easy over the holidays.
I come back from the holidays to an email on the 3rd where I am informed that my booking ""could not complete and needed a reentering of information"". I do so, and find out that my flight went from $214 to $375.
I called the next day to get my fare back, and was informed that there was ""nothing they could do"" because fares are ""subject to change.""
I BOOKED MY FLIGHT AND RECEIVED CONFIRMATION, THAT SHOULD BE GUARANTEED.
When I called, they also tried telling me that my card was declined due to insufficient funds (which was BS- I had just paid my credit card to zero, as I do monthly), and when I spoke to a manager, SHE tried to tell me it was because I entered my expiry date incorrectly.
Now, they did call me later on the 23rd to inform me that there was a problem with my card, but I never received that message due to the holidays and I was heading out of town. So, I give them that credit.
But, them trying to lie to me and tell me it was my fault or my credit card's fault (called Mastercard, they never got a charge from Onetravel nor rejected any) and not taking any responsibility is unacceptable.
Trash customer service and a BS website.
if there was a problem with my credit card, I never would have gotten a confirmation booking number.
Will never use this website again."
1085,3,"This flight booking service needs to be shut down seriously !!! They are basically a gaggle of slime-ball criminals whose call centers and no doubt head offices are located in some backwater INDIAN village with probably 5 uneducated , barely audible grumpy losers who are bottom of the barrel type people who do not mind telling you to go to hell and will sit there and explain their scams with no shame. The main scam they caught me on was selling me flight cancellation insurance claiming it was 11.00 and then they asked for my C.C. info and THEN the bill came back as 93.00 for the insurance, whereupon I called immediately to cancel the insurance and was told under no circumstances was that permitted and so then I said fine cancel the entire purchase and was told this was impossible too since the tickets were already PRINTED , like after less then 5 minutes after I clicked on the complete purchase part and saw they were scamming me for almost 100 bucks! These people are professional scum ...Indian 3rd world criminals and they really need to be barred from internet business and I am so pissed at them I just might do it . Oh ya, I called today 2 days after this fiasco to see if I could change the dates, since I was badly assaulted yesterday and my face is a mess, no way, minimum 350 dollars more, so I asked about cancelling the trip since I paid 100 almost for the cancellation insurance and I was told to get it I would need proper documentation saying I could not travel from my injuries! So in the end the cancellation insurance I was badly scammed with does not even cover you unless you have proof of injury! These guys are a blight on the online booking community!"
1086,3,"I booked a flight for myself and 6 friends. Price reduced a month after and when I informed them, they only offer a credit not refund by check as stated on my receipt. This credit also expires in one year. I only travel once a year and if I had booked directly through airline I would have been reimbursed by $220.."
1087,3,"Illegal Additional Charge: This company charges approximately $19.00 dollars for selection of a seat on a flight that has already been paid for. So why would the company charge you for your seat? hasn't that been already paid for with your purchase of the ticket? Beware...I believe it is an unacceptable practice !Passengers should clearly notified beforehand about this, if at all they want to apply this charge. When the company was contacted to cancel the charge it was refused, indicating the purchase was final."
1088,1,"Don't believe the many 5 star reviews...they are written by wholesale-flights.com (wf) themselves! I'm sure after I post this one, they will post a bunch of theirs to push mine to the bottom. After my wife got sick & we had to cancel our flights, Delta actually refunded our money with a letter from her Dr. They were non refundable tickets...""thanks, Delta"". However, the refund was sent to the consolidator wf uses in Venezeula. They have a scam on converting US $ into Venezeula $ & make money on the conversion. And, we got NOTHING back! WF says the tickets are nonrefundable...even if Delta actually refunded the tickets to them! Avoid WF at all costs! They will steal your money if given the chance."
1089,1,"I recently flew Sydney - London - North America and NY - Sydney. I should have been suspicious when I first booked the flights as I have to chase them the whole time to get things done but despite that I had good flights to the UK and Canada.
However having turned up to catch my flight to Chicago I found that the booking had been cancelled by United's fraud department leaving me stuck. I had to purchase an additional ticket at outrageous rates to continue my trip. No explanation from Wholesale flights on the subject and still (1 month later) waiting for a refund.
Despite booking the flight in June my return flights in December never good confirmed and it required constant emails (forget the phone they never talk to you). Finally I got a flight at the last minute and not even close to the flight I had paid for it was a 30 hour all stops.
NEVER use these guys if something goes wrong you have no comeback. Their customer service skills are non existent and it is impossible to call them.
I am still fighting to get my money back !"
1090,1,"Come on, guys...5 stars? I don't think so. Check out the profiles of all the ""people"" who reviewed the wholesale-flights.com site.

""Kevin did great... Mark was awesome..."" Yeah...okay. When's the last time you saw pages and pages of practically identical reviews? Only when they are fake...that's when."
1091,1,"netflix charged my credit card twice a month for six months. When I called the customer service number to correct the billing issue they told me my card had been hacked. How ever they would not close the fraudulent account nor would they stop charging my credit card, I had to cancel my account and cancel my credit card and have my credit card company dispute the charges to get netflix to stop stealing my money. Terrible crooked company."
1092,2,"I have been a Netflix customer for years. In June my credit card that was used for auto pay was ""red flagged"" for some reason that no one could explain at netflix customer service. I went to my bank and they saw no action from Netflix attempting payment. I then spoke again with a Netflix customer rep who was so rude. I asked to speak with a manager and was told ""no"" . Finally I did reach a manager and he could not explain or rectify the problem. I am done with them. So many other better choices out there. I can't say I have never been treated so poorly by a so called customer service before. Hulu, here I come!"
1093,2,"We were a long time subscriber of Netflix. Why we stayed so long I have no idea. Log on issues etc happened all too often. No trouble with Amazon, Hulu, or any of the others. The Netflix customer abuse department has one solution... reboot. When that doesn't fix the issue they claim it is your equipment or your internet provider. Generally the problem cures itself in an couple of hours, so in the past we have lived with it. Today, once again the problem raised head. After the standard ""reboot"" process failed, the customer abuse department rep told me that I had no other options but to call my internet provider. Remember, all other streaming channels work just fine...I told him that I had an additional option...Cancel my subscription!!!! NO MORE NETFLIX !!! Cheers !!!"
1094,3,"Amazon Prime is not worth it. The movies on prime are all old movies and movies that are not good. The ""documentaries"" are a joke. A lot of the movies have to be rented at $3.99 or bought. Then the ""free"" books you get on Prime Reading are no good. A lot of the books are British like the Psychology books. And they are really dull and not good. All of the American psychology books are only available for purchase. There are no Christian books available to read for free. Music Prime is also no good. You have to end up buying for everything. So it's a waste to pay for the subscription PLUS pay to get stuff that is actually worth it. None of their originals stand out either. They try too hard to beat Netflix but they are worse."
1095,1,"I signed up for Amazon Prime thinking the many extra services would be worth the cost. Turns out you get a watered down version of the ""real"" services. Prime books is not Kindle Unlimited. Prime music is a half version of Amazon's full music service. Both requiring additional sign ups and monthly fees to get the best experience. Okay that was probably in the fine print although still disappointing.
I received an email promising a $15 promo if I make a $30+ purchase. Fantastic because I could use a few things Santa forgot. After putting some things in my cart and proceeding to checkout, no promo. Reread the fine print. Purchase must be made on mobile app, check; purchase must be sold by and distributed from Amazon...oops. So back to the shopping cart, remove that, add this, check and check. Proceed but no promo. Hunt for code in fine print but nothing. Search a bit online was no help. *sigh* customer service time. I initiated a chat and things were looking good. Rep said she needed a copy of the email AMAZON sent me...um ok so I forwarded it. Rep confirmed the promo should have applied and went to talk to her Lead. Came back and asked if the order was placed on the app. I would think they could tell but I confirmed anyway. Back to Lead. Asked if products were sold and distributed by Amazon. Again, this is AMAZON'S app so they would know better than I would but I confirmed. Back to Lead. Offered a $5 courtesy promo rather than fix the problem. My response was to request my Prime membership be cancelled. Rather than attempting to keep my business and make the customer happy, she cheerfully cancelled my membership.
So no $30+ purchase, no $119 membership and future purchases, one very grumpy customer all to save the $10 ($15-5) they had offered me in the email.
My advice don't bother with Amazon Prime. If you can get the best price there, take advantage of the regular free shipping and for other services use one of the better rated ones available for music or books or video."
1096,3,"I paid for this service mostly for the movie service, but almost anything worth watching you still have to pay to rent. Why am I paying for the yearly subscription when I still have to pay more? The 2 day free shipping is good but I have continusly gotten stuff late."
1097,3,why does Sony crackle have to place that incandescent emblem in the lower right-hand corner of the screen obscuring part of your movie? To let me know that I'm actually watching Sony crackle? did I not tune into this particular station? Did I not actually click on a movie under a Sony crackle title? Then why the hell did they see the need to put it there??? They sure don't put it there on those hundreds of commercials they run!
1098,3,Worked great with little commercial interruption untill it displays message that if you want less commercial advertising to sign in.. so after creating an account and signing in I have more commercials than ever. Attempted to watch a movie and every 5 mins commercial interruption. Preformed a test. Same movie with sign in lasted 31 mins longer than same movie in different TV without sign in.. WTF.
1099,1,"I can not Express my distance for commercials while watching movies. The ""well timed"" cuts that are made are intrusive, always unwanted, and for me I lose interest when every 5 minutes the movie is interrupted by some dumb ad selling some dumb crap I dont need or want. This is why once I found streaming, I got rid of my cable TV provider and now save a crap load of money and dont have to watch stupid ads. Win, right!? I thought until Sony Crackle happened to have a movie I wanted to see, and my 4g roku tv happened to have Sony Crackle the stars must be aligned! Then, just as I was getting into the movie Some idiot that has no business editing or cutting for that matter cut for commercial right in the middle of a good scene. I figured ok one ad isnt bad, then there was another, and another, just like trying to watch a movie on local television. It got so bad that all interst has been lost in my movie I wanted to watch, and decided to tell y'all dont bother nothing but ads, and frustration can be found on Sony's Cracked streaming ap. The details say the ap is free, yeah free if you don't value your time. If Sony Crackle were a piece of paper I would wad it up set that on fire and burn the idea. Good job ruining streaming Sony you losers."
1100,3,"The ONLY reason I'm still paying Hulu, using their streaming service is because they are the only service that provide the shows I like. Netflix used to carry a lot of them (Archer, It's always sunny in Philadelphia, South Park..etc.) but for whatever idiotic reason, they decided to stop letting us stream that online.. Prime sucks even more. Hulu is the only one that carries these shows but they make the whole streaming experience worse than being stuck in an elevator with Al Gore for days. I can't stand them, it's the same kind of issues, time after time after time. No matter how many times I report it, how many times others report it and complain, they refuse to fix their issues.
And when they changed their user interface.. god, I didn't know they could suck even more, on top of all the recurring issues.
Constant problems that won't allow streaming.
Autoplay is a joke, it works maybe 30% of the time.
User interface sucks.
The one thing they needed to do, was allow streaming.. and when that's the main issue.. then what good are they?
If only I knew somewhere else where I can stream my shows with less problems than Hulu, I'd drop them in half a heartbeat!"
1101,3,"To Whom it May Concern,
At the beginning of the NFL season, I decided to create an account with Hulu in order to stream some of the games. However, I decided to cancel my account after a few weeks because I did not need to stream any more of the games and because I did not want the extra bill. After canceling my account, I was still being billed by Hulu even though my account had been deactivated. I was very confused by this so I tried contacting Hulu to get this problem fixed. It took quite a lot of work and time to get this problem resolved. However, I did not mind the time or trouble, but it was the customer service that frustrated me the most. The customer service was horrendous and one of the worst experiences that I have ever had. I repeatedly sent emails to your headquarters and I tried calling you countless of times only to have be left on hold. You never replied to any of the emails I sent. Not having the courtesy to send an email back really speaks volumes of how you think of your customers. However as bad as not replying to my emails, the phone calls were still somehow worse. Sometimes my calls were never even answered at all in the first place and the phone would just continue to ring. It took about a dozen different calls for me to even get to interact with a real human. Eventually, my problem was fixed, but not without a tireless amount of work from myself and loads of frustration."
1102,2,"Signed up for a ""free"" trial - just received my bank statement and it seems I was charged 6.36 for choosing the commercial free option when I signed up for my trial. Was I asked if this charge was ok? NO! Was I ever notified that a charge would occur- NOPE! I called their customer service line and got an I'm sorry and there's nothing I can do- this among many other reasons is why I cancelled my Hulu membership."
1103,3,"It started off as a good website to watch Anime, but then they filled it with all these annoying ads that change every few seconds. My browser can't handle all these ads and it's gotten so bad that I can't even watch a single episode of anime without the page becoming unresponsive. Then there's the annoying Chatango message thing which is also making it difficult for the page to completely load."
1104,3,"Terrible, and all because of the ads. This website reloads a new advertisement every few seconds. You can see the loading icon in the website tab. The worst thing is all these ads have sound and it plays even during when you are watching an anime episode. Also, if you try to run any sort of ad blocking tool, the episodes refuse to load and a popup message tells you to disable any ad blocking software. For this kind of annoyance you figure the anime would be in very high quality. It's not."
1105,1,"there was an advertisment that popped up when i was watching a video, upon completion of this add my Symantec Endpoint Protection started reporting entry attemps on my SVCHOST.EXE in the system32 folder, also my computer had a attachment of Tidserv (a trogin horse virus used by hacker's to open a back door on a computer). i had to contact my DELL technical support team to help remove this threat. i advise this site i listed not to be used."
1106,3,"Got it, hooked it up, tried moving the antenna around and got nothing. E-mailed them for help and they told me to mail it back to the Netherlands. How many people won't spend the money to mail it back? They are probably counting on that."
1107,3,"Terrible. I don't know want to say. I use Firefox with adblock, and still it opens up new tabs when you click play. It loads slow. It is not even HD. It is SD. Slow buffer. Standard YouTube videos have better quality. I have been using project free tv for a while now and I have become gradually sick of it. It works, but it is just not worth it. Absolutely disgusted with it."
1108,3,"I contacted google play support about my debit card being charged by grindr without my permission and told them Grindr ran my card 11 times in August 2018 trying to change from $9.99 to $12.49, then to $12.99. Also id lost my old card and my new card # was posted back on google play. Id removed my old card from google play and had not put my new # on it. I demanded to know how it got put on there. I believe Grindr did this as they just refunded one $12.99 and it went on this card. Google play is trying to say i hit a wrong button when on my subscription page it shows I cancelled Grindr in July."
1109,1,I had a purchase declined so went to purchase again which was successful only to find out I was charged twice. Contacted Google to be told yes we can see it was declined and went through twice (admitted liability) was told he would deal with it to then be told it had been refused. What rubbish service which is obviously theft.
1110,1,"I had some unauthorized charges in December that I submitted a claim for. At first I was really happy because they said I would get a full reimbursement. Then they stated that it would go back onto my card that the original charges had occurred. I've stated numerous times to numerous people that my bank issued me a new card so I don't know if it will work.
I've been repeatedly ignored, I've been lied to-I was told my claim would be in by the 18th, when I contacted them yesterday they said that the refund that was submitted had an error and they submitted it again. They refuse to just mail me a check or give me solid proof that a refund was even submitted.
Do not do business with this website!"
1111,1,"There's no way I can see my experience as anything but engineered thievery. I tried to cancel my premium membership for months, only getting an error that said they couldn't process the request at this time. Being a busy person, I did what probably hundreds do; I shrugged my shoulders, said it's just $7, and said I'd try again later. Of course, it's my fault for often forgetting about it. HOWEVER... IT WAS NEVER AN ERROR. Turns out if you pay with paypal, crunchyroll doesn't allow you to cancel through their site, you have to cancel through paypal. Why was this information not given when I tried to cancel? Why did I have to go searthing to figure out this information? IT'S BECAUSE CRUNCHYROLL KNOWS MANY PEOPLE WILL HAVE MY WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE. People are waiting to try cancelling again later while Crunchyroll knowingly steals their money when they often forget about it. To top all this off, they have no customer service line to call and talk to a human about this issue. Seriously, this company is an engineered scam."
1112,3,"I was encouraged to use crunchyroll to view the anime I love from anywhere in the world. Maybe once it was ok. Now... it is a nightmare.
Many sites offer a ""ad based"" or ""pay to experience no ads"" type of subscription and crunchyroll claims to be one of them.
However, you will soon find that ads are used not occasionally, but incessantly... to force you to subscribe or go insane.
In fact, many of the ads are shown 4 or 5 times in a row. In the case of final fantasy... I just saw EIGHT ads in a row. This not only resulted in an unusually long (and boring!) delay for me, but actually a false charge to the folks who paid for the ad. They may believe the ad is being played to 8 different people when ... instead I saw the SAME ad eight times!!!
The ads only serve one purpose here: to get you to think that if you don't pay for the premium service (that they bait you into accepting even during their registration process!), or suffer the ad bombardment.
I actually almost completed the paid for service once I started going through the crunchyroll.com site because it came up so fast and covered so much of the registration page that _I thought it was the registration for the crunchyroll site_.
I tried coming in through the web site instead of the App and I found even more problems.
The show I had been watching was not listed.
There was no obvious search bar although I found it eventually. This lets them easily force you to watch what they are supposed to promote.
And finally once I searched for and found the show I wanted to watch... They showed a bunch of episodes that happen later without even showing the earlier episodes first even though I hadn't watched them yet. Almost hidden to the right side of the screen in a lightly colored background: ""resume watching"".
Wow, this is seriously a bad site. I am not at all surprised with the 1 star average although I bet my review will make it even more clear to you WHY everyone gives this one star."
1113,1,"I canceled my subscription and deleted my account a while ago and I'm still being billed..I wouldn't make an account with them, specially seeing as I'm not the only one with this problem. If you want to watch Anime there are plenty of free sites to use.
Don't waste your money."
1114,1,"What a disappointment!! I have the n2 and it was a waste of money!! On top of that there is zero support. No updates, box freezes. I found a great idea buy smart tv with android support. And use kodi or Iptv directly on your tv. Best experience using kodi or iptv!!"
1115,2,i emailed 4 times and called. they said they would replace my box because the power did not come in since i purchase it only in march. i was then told to ship it which cost me 17$. i ship it and then they tell me i have no warranty and they send box back. i told them keep it no use to me and i hang up. but no good customer service means i not come back it is sad the don care aboot the customer
1116,1,"I bought a Avov fuse. They don't keep up on the apps. only 8 gb hardrive. Cant load hardly any apps once kodi is loaded. no file explorer.
teamviewer app doesn't let you dial in to set up box. live tv constantly freezing. buy a cheap android tv box is better."
1117,3,Could only see three minutes of offered free movie at a time and then had to go back and restart with more commercials to be interrupted with more commercials. Roku is charging folks and doing a bait and switch. Movies for commercials.
1118,3,"What happened? Due to busy work schedule I have not had a chance to watch OV for months but now that I want to watch, the loading is horrible. I can't figure out what I am selecting. I tried deleting and reloading app with no success. I watched OV for years with no loading problems until now."
1119,3,Such a joke and misleading offering FREE movies and programs. 3 commercials every 5 minutes of a movie is not worth watching something for free. I'm beginning to think all of Roku's free sites are a joke Excessive commercials on any of the free movie sites.
1120,3,"My rating on overall is just Ok. There are certainly some good training but some just shucks! The title is one among those shucks.
Data Structures and Algorithms in Java MANAGE IN PLAYLISTS.
The Java courses are highly disoriented. Different concepts are taken by different trainers and there is no enough coordination on what is covered and what is not. There is a lot of duplicate content. Luckily educba has fast forward and speed run options. Would have been a real pain otherwise.
I have completed the basics of java programming course, however, it repeats in any other course content which I feel is a total waste of time for me. Started going through Data Structures and Algorithms. Half of the session is again about basics. Too much duplication!
The topic of the training is covered only in the last chapter - 15th chapter and the trainer is still wandering through the basics. It really sucks!
I felt this tutorial total waste of time."
1121,3,"I honestly don't find the video trainings/tutorials entertaining. Monotonic and boring. There are times that the instructor is just talking and the videos display is not in any way related to what he/she is explaining. In a first glimpse, this is a poor training online facility BUT i look forward that educba will sort this issues specially with english tone. Therefore I won't withdraw my subscription and will continue on."
1122,2,"Being in the IT industry for a couple of years now, I am in desperate means to further my career up the ladder through some self-teaching education with the help of online resources and having seen a ""lifetime"" worth of IT training via Engadget, i thought i was getting myself a hell of a deal...quite literally, it was indeed hell..."
1123,1,"I have been working with studypool for almost a year now, but the experience has been worst. I was once suspended after following a procedure given to me by the support an cancellation of an order I could not do, and also I was suspended just because the student asked for a refund for an order and giving another claim while the QAD was giving a claim that is not related to the order. For those who aspire to work with studypool don't do this account. Just another account because these people are after the money and not helping both the student and the tutor. These guys will ruin your account until they ban you."
1124,1,"Do not bother with their Chat function. They respond at their convenience. Algorithms match requestors with providers, not humans and the matches rarely fit. It does not matter if you click a link that supposedly directs you to a prepared solution. You will still get a tutor, not a solution - click bait! Once you are paired with someone, you are stuck with them regardless of competency level. Many tutors misrepresent their capabilities and deliver grossly inferior products. If you are seeking a simple essay, they may be OK but steer clear if you need assistance with anything advanced or complex. They now hold over $100 in my account and will not refund."
1125,1,"ok- This is a very dopey company. It seems as tho they are asleep.
They do not update the website so the courses that are outdated or have been withdrawn are still being advertised as being available to study.
I enrolled on one of their 'withdrawn' courses which they were not aware of because after paying the fee/enrollment process, I did not receive the course login details for over a week which I thought was odd considering the course took place online so I queried them about it and the customer rep said, 'still waiting for exam board confirmation'. So i waited another week and still nothing so I sent them another email and this time response was 'we are currently looking into this and will get back asap'. And still nothing so I requested for a refund because I got fed up of the slow responses and rightly so. And then it wasn't until almost a month into my enrollment they sent me an email informing me that the course had been withdrawn and recommended me an alternative course which I'm not obliged to switch to.
This course was not available to study, it had been withdrawn and yet it was still advertised on their website which led me to enrol with them in the first place. Had this course been available to study, I would have been a month into the course instead I spent a month chasing this refund which they do not plan to refund in full (minus 20quid 'cancellation fee') but i will lodge a complaint.
What does this tell us? As course providers, it is their responsibility to keep up to date with the courses' specification such as course availability in my case, and update their website which they do not do.Hence they have wasted a over a month of my time.
Avoid at ALL costs."
1126,1,"This online College (Oxford Distance Learning) tells prospective students they can receive learning materials either by electronic copy or hardcopy. You pay £40 for opting for a hardcopy. However, when you opt for the electronic copy and you open the file once, you cannot open the file again. You cannot also print the file. This is after paying fees of more than £400. It leaves you with no option, but to request for a hardcopy and cough out a further £40 pounds. These people at oxford distance learning are really thieves. When you complain about not being able to open the electronic version of their course material they just tell you to try again after spending time and units on the phone to explain your frustration. I registered for a course and opted for both the electronic course material and payment by instalment. After paying the first instalment and not being able to open the file, I complained to them but to no avail. I refused to pay the rest of the course fees till they rectified the situation with my course materials but they simply suspended my account and forwarded it to debt collectors. That is for a service that was never delivered and and the most appaling customer service I have ever experienced. Stay off Oxford Distance Learning (also Oxford College)!!!! They are crooks!!!"
1127,1,Positive reviews probably written by the staff of the website themselves. The support was poor. Tutor pathetic. No good learning materials provided. It was an expensive paper that was a waste of time.
1128,1,"This site is total crap. Should be illegal. They advertise pdf downloads of legit manuals. What I got was a MASSIVE file (8GB) of an outdated BMW service program, which they probably don't even have the legal rights to sell, and then you have to download another program (a 'virtual viewer') in order to open/navigate it. Once you're finally in, half of the information tabs open blank - no info at all. Because you're in a 'virtual viewer' you can't print anything to take out to your shop... it goes on and on.
Then to top it all off, after the huge hassle of download/install, within days my credit card was compromised with mysterious charges! Coincidence? I think not.
DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SCAM!!!"
1129,1,"These people will send you a link to a download that is massive (18GB).
Then it fails, you try again & again & again.
You email them, they send you a link to the same download.
Then that one fails, you try again & again & again.
You tell them and they then run you through PayPal and you have to message and respond in a constant loop of going nowhere. Then you ask for a refund and then PayPal ask you to return the purchase and provide a tracking number! Ha ha these people are dodgy and I would love to greet them in person to give them a special thanks with a size 10 boot. Do not trust these scam artists."
1130,1,"I purchased the manuals download for my 2004 BMW Z4 because the description said it included all the manuals including wiring diagrams (which is what I needed most). What I received were illegible, extremely low resolution scans of shop manuals and a wiring diagram for a single model that isn't mine. It's completely useless. I've attached an example ofthe quality of manual I received. Completely useless. These people are criminals."
1131,1,This company uses folks who do not even understand syntax and have zero grasp of Grammer for the English language. I have no idea why this company is allowed to continue to be in business. They didn't follow the directions for the works and then refused to refund the money paid. Truly a trash company. Do not waste your time or funds.
1132,1,"Gave them more than a week, on the day i was suppose to get the paper they said it is not ready. Couple of hours later they sent me the document, completely did not follow instructions. i gave them a very detailed information and instructions did not follow it. you can tell they wrote the paper in hurry, when told it is wrong they kept me back and forth telling me they are checking. Then they said they need more time. Again couple of hours later they told me i didn't provide enough information and i have to provide them with the reference. Again asked for more time, mind you i am passed my due date to submit the paper. Refused to refund my money. By this time i sat all night and wrote my own paper and i needed my money back. They refused and the insist they will edit. When i refuse, they told me it takes time to investigate and refund. They are liars, don't trust them at all. Until you give them all your money they are very sweet and helpful, once they get their money, they don't care about you."
1133,3,"Despite giving all the info and even login to my account, they said i didnt provide enough info. I had to turn in incomplete paper, i asked them to add more they said oh its going to take 24 hrs its due that day! It wasnt my fault for them to find anothing person. They take money very fast yet they take 24 hrs to add lil info."
1134,1,"I would stay away. I just completed their Java Course. It is no where near a complete course. There are far superior courses online. And youdon't have to pay for them. I'm so disappointed. Im not sure if the Prop gives you any other lessons. But why pay when there are far more superior courses such as Edx, Stanfords CS106a. If you do CS106a, Make sure you use Professor Mehran Sahami's lectures. The other Professors are not as good.Kevin Crawford."
1135,1,"I'm a freshman in college majoring in Software Engineering. I've taken a Java course and a C course so far, but I wanted an extra resource to help me get better at programming. I turned to Codeacademy and upgraded to pro. It was easy at first, but the courses breezed through the lessons without going in depth much. I got to conditionals, which are easy and enjoyable for me. I filled out one of the exercises and it kept telling me I was wrong. I knew I wasn't, I've used conditionals many times, and even filled in the exact example they were giving me. Still wrong. I gave up and the code they gave me in the answer was the exact same as mine. What the $#*!? This happened many times. I got very frustrated and asked for a refund, knowing this was not going to work for me. They gave me a refund, but then charged me again and took my money. I emailed them about it and their customer representative was rude and the customer service was $#*!ty. They did nothing about it, still don't have my refund. $#*! Codeacademy!"
1136,3,"I should say the design of the site is pretty user-friendly. However, the contend is poorly written -- full of typos and repeating sentences, etc. -- to the point that it confuses the reader. That is pretty bad for beginners who wish to learn coding. And even for paying customers, who theoretically can ask personalized questions, never get respond to any questions asked. So maybe you can try the free version, but it's not worth paying for it. It's not like there are no high quality (even free) alternatives available."
1137,3,Website operation was funky and ordered something I didn't want. Contacted customer service right away and said nothing they could do but for me to return it when I received it. Also a few days later they removed a promotional code I entered that was accepted and proceeded to charge my credit card the incremental difference without my authorization. Noresponse from customer service when I complained about this.
1138,2,"I was a former customer of this company, indeed, I had purchased several of their lecture series. However, I was dismayed to find they had published a shockingly inadequate and one sided series of lectures on Winston Churchill that were factually and historically biased.
I pointed this out on their Facebook announcement, and listed the omissions. My comment was popular and received several likes and accolades from other followers of the page. However, shortly afterwards I was trolled by a staff member, who publicly and rudely made several unfounded accusations against my character in a comment. I firmly, but politely responded, then found my comment was removed and I was blocked from their Facebook page.
I could understand if I had written something offensive, but I merely pointed out serious omissions of their product. Furthermore, I work in customer service and know there is NEVER an excuse to troll or otherwise take an accusatory tone with customers.
In short:
The customer service is rude,
The lectures on history are NOT impartial, and are heavily biased,
This company is dishonest and will hide honest feedback.
After seeing how the Teaching Company's lectures are biased, and how this was handled by your staff, I will not trust your lectures again. Once trust is gone it can never be restored, nor should it."
1139,1,Be wary of this company. Don't use any promo codes and make sure you know exactly what you're getting into with them. They bill your credit card or bank account and never give you a receipt or email about any subscription.
1140,1,"There are thousands of online iq tests available but this website tricks people by not telling them that they need to waste $15-20 on a test that is offered free by most sites. Its so bizarre that once you have wasted good mins of your life finishing the quiz, iqtests starts begging money to send result as if that stupid certificate can be used in real life. Its just a test!!! Get your own iq tested and find an adequate source of income. Secondly play it square. You should mention that anyone who wants to waste $20 on a damn online test should waste time answering 36 questions.
Highly disappointed with this fraudulent site."
1141,1,"Anyone that gave the the test one star is certified as having a low IQ. Someone with a high IQ would have researched the reviews of this website first BEFORE wasting their time taking it. They would have verified if there was a cost to get the answers.
So there you go...your certified stupid. Don't worry I'm not being mean. I got duped too. I guess I'm not hat smart either."
1142,2,"MANNN I done did this whole test when I shouldve been doing my assessments and they gone tell me to pay AFTER I did almost 40 dumb ass questions. Asking me bout a house like a donut,what? I really did math in my head and with my fingers to not know if im dumb or not. really tried to be smart for once. give me my time back tf."
1143,1,"I purchased an exam dump from their site and only few (4-5) questions were from their dumps. I failed the exam, when I sent an email to refund my money, no one replied. Never buy any dump from this site dumps4download."
1144,1,"I purchased from this site and did not receive any confirmation or any response from them for almost 3 hours. I reached out via chat and requested a refund. ""Sophia"" the manager became irate and angry and started to threaten me stating she will report my details to Amazon about me using dumps so that I will never be able to attain my certificate and will be banned from Amazon for life. What sort of ""business"" responds this way to a customer? Stay far away from this site because they will go out of their way to threaten you! Mind you, I was not once rude and simply requested a refund and gave them a reason why and yet they lashed at me threatened me. Very unprofessional."
1145,2,"When I signed up for the free membership I was of course trying it out with the 2 months, I signed up and received a date that I would be charged on, great, planning money whoo. I have been billed 6 days early, and it is taken my account down to near empty because they charged me early. They do not have a customer service number, just an email refund request that can take up to 3 business days to just contact me, so I am stuck in the $#*!ter for several days because they charged me early. I am fully canceling, I didn't hate their product, just the billing factor, I actually enjoyed the website but will no longer be willing to use it because of this MAJOR issue."
1146,1,Selling an item on teachers pay teachers is one way to sell. However they are a rip off because they take more than half of the money you make on the website. For instance I sold an item for $3.00 that I worked really are to create and they charged me $1.35 as their commission an additional .30 cent as a transaction fee. It left me with the earnings of $1.35. This website is designed to take all of your profit. It is so sad to see websites like this. They could make such a wonderful impact by getting these items out there but they make absolute sure that the seller pays them half of what they make or even more. Such a shame.
1147,3,"I have only used them once and the materials that I bought (which I couldn't completely see before buying) were so lame, so subpar (I guess I'm used to the many wonderful FREE lessons that are published by sites like Busy Teacher) that I wrote a review in which I was very specific about what was wrong with the material. About two weeks later, I received a very insulting email from the author/s, basically telling me off, that I hadn't had to buy it, etc. When I complained to TPT they basically said, sorry, we don't interfere with what the authors write but you can respond. Well, when I tried, they had pulled down the materials. Fast forward about two months and this is what I have just received even though I had unsuscribed from TPT. ""This is MINE and you should only review things you have bought (???)I like how you are too chicken to sign your name. Grow some balls!"" yep, these are supposed to be college educated, professionals. All I can say is that it supports my general feeling that there is no quality control in TPT, especially for the higher grades. The stuff that I bought (for Around the world in 180 days) was so badly done, it probably was written by some hack."
1148,3,"I really loved this site and used a particular store that had awesome resources, unit bundles, etc for my courses. Unfortunately I found out 4 students in my class gained access to this website and purchased the same resources. I'm aggravated that they so easily accessed the same information. I logged on so long ago so I can't remember if there was some sort of security to ensure that my own students would not be able to access the site the same way I did."
1149,3,"The lip gloss does not work for me as a plumper, nor does it feel or look natural. I have reached out to the company twice without a response in hopes of returning my unused product. Be careful during checkout... You will receive ""deals"" that make it look like you are only adding one item to your order, but you are actually adding 3. I now have $150 worth of lip gloss in a box that I will never need and could have bought for $5."
1150,2,"I was disappointed to discover how easily I was ready to buy into their hype about their products that were good for you and worked wonderfully. But having been around a while, I always check into the ""facts"" on things that sound so amazing. And it didn't take more effort than going over the ingredient list for the Invisicrepe body balm (or any of their products) to find several items that are known to be health hazards and are on ""red lists"" at sites such as http:www.safecosmetics.org and ewg.com.
two examples of groups dedicated to exposing the realities of having no regulations over safety and content of personal products."
1151,3,"I bought the Pro Longwear Lip Pencils and I was not told by the staff that I will need a special sharpener because it's made from plastic. This was such a disappointment as I really try avoid single use plastic knowing it's devastating impact on our planet. Basically sharpening this pencil creates micro-plastic that probably ends up polluting land and the ocean. I find it concerning a brand like MAC does not take care of this, and does not use a simple alternative like we've always done.
Please stop using single use plastic unnecessary."
1152,1,"For me, make up Is fun. It's about enhancing the parts of us we love and yes ( covering up) those we don't ie pimples. It's the colours we see and the beauty of the ingredients used to make the products we love. Happy fun time. Companies such as Mac destroy that by taking these beautiful ingredients and using them to inflict pain. On an Animal. Mac is actually the most vile of these cruel brands. It was originally a not tested on animals brand and took pride in that. Their makeup was about fun, as it should be. They lost their sense of fun will chasing that almighty dollar. Even though they were a very successful brand they wanted more. They wanted the Chinese market. A market that insists by law that all products must be tested in animals. Mac cannot even use the excuse that they are worried about the safety of their clients. Pure greed at any cost. Do you really believe they would put your safety before the dollar."
1153,2,"I bought an eyeshadow from MAC online store. I knew it was a very popular eyeshadow and they were waiting for the stocks to ship my eyeshadow. They told me that they could ship my eyeshadow 2 weeks after. And so, I patiently waited for 2 weeks and chatted with MAC again about this order. They simply told me ""we don't have this item, you can cancel your order if you want."" Very unprofessional and very unhelpful. Instead of helping me to get my eyeshadow or letting me know more detail about my order, the representative just told me to cancel it and did not care about whether I could get this order or not. I ended up cancelled my order and was very upset about the their services. Will never want to purchase again from them!"
1154,3,"Placed an order 11/25/2017. As of today, 12/4/2017, it is still showing as ""processing"" on the website. Customer service is ""so sorry"" but doesn't offer an ETA or any sort of compensation for the slow slow processing/shipping time. I have asked for the order to be cancelled but have not as yet received a response."
1155,2,"We learned about this case in law school.
Urban Decay was started by 2 friends in a kitchen. One friend had the actual idea for the company, came up with the names, worked thousands of hours with no pay doing all the actual work of the company, the other put up the money. Guess which one screwed the other over and took control of the business, claiming it as her own brainchild and stealthily forcing the other one out? Yep, the rich, entitles one.
I will NEVER buy Urban Decay.
No scruples, no morals.
Read the case yourself: Holmes v Lerner, 74 Cal.App. 4th, 442."
1156,2,"Honestly I was excited on trying this.. but after hours in, I was red as a tomato and broke out. Now I don't even want to see the light of day!!! Thank you! But no thanks."
1157,2,"If you have any sort of problem with your online order, good luck finding someone who will be able to help. There is absolutely zero accountability with this company, they will continue to give you the runaround because no one is willing to actually help. I asked to speak to management on several occasions and I was shuffled around. Finally, I asked for an email address so I could submit a formal claim, once again, NOTHING. For being a loyal ""rouge vib"" customer for so many years, it makes instances like these realize how much you and your business to this company really doesn't matter to them. I will be shopping elsewhere going forward. Happy to note that Nordstrom also carries everything I need and always delivers outstanding customer service."
1158,3,"I went into a store and I was greeted. I was looking for something for my grandma because it was her birthday, however I was on the phone and I wasn't paying attention to my surroundings. One of the associates kept coming over to me as if she thought I was going to steal something. I picked up an item and put it back before I reminded myself I was there to buy someone a gift. After she seen me without the item I guess she thought I was trying to steal it because she kept coming over to asking did I still want it. I couldn't find the gift my grandma wanted so I ended up buying the product I wanted and once I left she stared me down and didn't even say goodbye or anything like that. I just felt like she was being biased and racist."
1159,2,"Really, Sephora? I have been VIP Rouge for years and a makeup addict. I have over 2,000 points in my account at the moment. The rewards are terrible, the choices limited and/or sold out. Two samples instead of three? And they don't even send the ones you choose...like whatever is leftover. With the mark up on cosmetics, an extra sample is not a huge expense for this company. I generally order online and have minimal interaction with real people. There is so much competition in this industry and Sephora used to be the leader. Now I make Ulta and Space NK my first choice. So sad."
1160,2,Hair color did not lighten at all. Called customer service and was told basically it was me and worked for everyone else! Sending out coupons but why do they need my phone number? I refused. Will never use brand again.
1161,2,"Why you write a wrong color in the box of hair color feria, I try to get dark violeta and I got read as tomatoe red , and I'm ready open the box and mix everything hoping turn dark Violet's or purple but not is red as tomatoe so I just lose money for try to get trust on your name you should no lies to new customer I'm anger you bet I'm ready to used and now I have to go and look for different name or company thanks a lot for you lies in the box and isn't a mistake the number out side the box and the product inside is the same. Atte Lupita Holmes."
1162,3,"I bought a box of l'oreal paris feria blowout burgundy. After coloring my hair, I found both gloves had holes in it. Left hand is dyed on 2 fingernails while right side pinky fingernail. My nails were polished in purple color but your dye has made 3 of my nails nice dark red color. Luckily I have rubber gloves I can use to finish my coloring. Not the first time this happened to me. Not sure if I'd use any of your product."
1163,2,"I tried to cancel an order using their chat feature. I wanted to cancel my old order and place a new order. Their chat representative spent about 20 minutes trying to convince me not to cancel the order before finally ""cancelling"" the order for me.
A week or so later, I received the package with my cancelled order. When I contacted them as to why I received the cancelled order, I don't get an apology. I had to go out of my way to ship back to them a package I should have never received.
I don't care how good your product is, you lose customers when you provide bad customer service."
1164,3,"I have been a life-long user of Clinique products and was content. Recently, I bought dramatically different moisturizing lotion (pump version). When I first used it, there was an unusual odor - almost like cortisone cream. One morning, upon applying it, my face turned orange. I called customer service and was told something about my reaction or sensitivity. Awaiting some measure/ refund."
1165,3,"One week ago last Saturday, I went to a Clinique counter at Nellis Air Force base just outside of Las Vegas, NV. There were 4 consultants standing around talking in a language that was unfamiliar to me. I stood at the 3-step counter for approximately 10 minutes without being approached by one consultant. The woman's name is Mihwa. I asked her about under eye treatment, and which would be the best for me. She tried to sell me other cosmetic products as well as placing cucumbers on my eyes. I told her that was a fallacy. She also told me they do not make commission or receive a discount. It appeared to be more important to her. She did not offer to let me try any of the testers. I worked for Clinique nearly 18 years part-time and would have been let go if I treated a customer that way. In my opinion, their supervisor needs to watch them incognito, and see how they act with customers at their counters. Also, it would be nice if the consultant spoke English so the customer can understand them, and promote Clinique products other than Bobbi Brown, Prescriptives, Bed Bath and Beyond, Origins, plus homemade remedies such as oatmeal. That is the worst experience I have ever had at a Clinique counter."
1166,3,"I have loved my FFF boxes but this last Edit sale and their response to it has left a bad impression on me. I have purchased $700 worth of items in the last Edit sale and am now 18 days after I've paid still with no tracking information, ETA or assurance from FFF that my items are shipping out. They have clearly broken FTC laws by refusing to send out products outside of their promised delivery window to customers who have already paid for them! Not only that the canned response from them is that it's still processing and I'll receive an email as soon as it ships. I have never had to use this much energy in chasing after information about a huge purchase before. Also, after the sale they notified those still waiting that there have been a list of Out if Stock items which is crazy because we already paid for the items. As days after the promised delivery date started to pass, the Out of Stock items list started to grow. So now after having to chat with multiple FFF reps, I am now missing 5 items on that OOS list which I've paid for. When I asked for a refund I was refused a refund because it's ""processing"" and I asked several times and finally got it after asking on the third try. I literally had to beg for a refund for items that haven't shipped out yet and will probably never ship out until 1 month later. So here I am 18 dats after paying and no one still can give me info on where my items are. Out $700 and nothing to show for it. I would be more understanding if FFF was truly empathetic. I have never felt so devalued as a customer. Very disheartening to feel this way and ignored as a customer. I simply want to know where my paid for items are and when I will receive them!"
1167,1,"Ordered this box as I'm a massive fan of beauty boxes and have another 3 monthly subscriptions. After triple checking that they send to the UK I decided to order. Its currently being held at postoffice as there is near £30 of import tax and custom charges on the package. Iv tried for 2 day to get either a refund or the package paid for but with the awful live chat service I havnt had any success or answers. They don't even type a reply they have a hanfull of answers they choose from, there best line being 'one moment' which let me tell you is very frustrating. Awful company and even worse chat/complaint team, and that's even before I received the box."
1168,1,"A friend sent me a starter box and i really liked it so i decided to sign up. I read on the site that new members could customize some options and that is the ONLY reason i was willing to sign up. I had a coupon code for 10 dollars off and when i clicked on get the box it just automatically charged me. I figured it would be like EVERY other site and take me to a checkout page. That's so sneaky that they just charge you with one click like that. I emailed them to cancel my order, they haven't emailed me back but if they refuse to cancel my order i'll be disputing the charge because that isn't right. I also got my starter box with my husbands credit card and since they didn't give me a chance to review it or change it, it charged his card for the full box so i know he's gonna be annoyed. Would not recommend."
1169,1,"I'm a reasonable lady but their customer service department is the definition of awful. They close their eyes and ears to what you want as a customer and almost bully you because they want your money. They don't honor anything on their site like 8 hours to change an order or 36 hours for a reply; they will ignore your emails to the point where you want to tear your hair out. They have a ridiculous policy of 15% penalty fee for cancelling an order....I just wanted to cancel to revise the type of contacts and sign up for an account for rewards, within 1 hour of placing my order, but they WOULD NOT listen or respond to any of my emails. Trash company with an embarrassing lack of self awareness. I regret placing such a huge order with them. Their ""good prices"" or ""sales"" are a farce too. You can find the lenses cheaper with faster shipping and better reliability from KLENSPOP which I only wish I'd known about before doing business with this sham of a company. Stay awaaaay. Currently dealing with my payment method about the situation."
1170,1,"Unfortunately my experience with this company was absolutely awful... They sent me a defective product and refused to replace it.
I paid over $30 for contacts I could not wear because it was a rip in the middle of one of them.
I was told to take a picture of the contact against a black background after doing so I was told: oh well we can't replace the product because you opened it it's the customer's duty to examine the product before opening it.
There was no way I would have been able to see a rip in the contacts inside the bottle.
If I were you I would not buy from this company stay far far away.
They will refuse to replace any of their defective product it also took 20 days to receive my package.
I really wish I could give them a one-star"
1171,1,"It is two weeks, and I have paid close to 150 US dollars for some contact lenses. They have not shipped. They won't respond to any emails. I don't know what else to do, except share my negative experience with other shoppers. All I am asking is for them to ship my order but I cannot even get a response as to why not, from them. I cannot recommend this company who takes your money and then disappears.. They do not take paypal so they make it harder on purpose to get a refund. I will call the bank in the morning. please find a different company, as it seems to be hit or miss on whether this company will steal your money."
1172,1,"Once you have subscribed they KEEP sending you boxes and charging you Every single month, eveb after having requested via email 4/5 times that i habe moved residences and to CANEL THE SUBSCRIPTION.. multiple times! Ir is the third time now i am overdrawn on my account due to this unauthorized order.. it is an Absolute scam i am disgusted. They state the subscription can only be cancelled over email and that is simply a load of garbagr because they Do not cancel the subscription. I am now contacting the fraud department of my bank and telling them what is going on and having them block them from my account and taking out funds kr simply get rid of that subscription so they cannot simply keep unlawfully charging my accoujt and sending out boxed that i have NOT ASKED for or ordered... its absolitely horrible what this so called subscription and company is doing to their clients.. never supportinf this brand againdue to this disgusting fraud and luting experience."
1173,3,"These people! I cannot even express how disappointed I am in these people and this company! I really wanted to give them a try for a few months and I thought they would have amazing products and customer service since, ya know... they have one of the most expensive sub boxes I have seen! $30 per month. Thats more then FabFitFun!!! Which, by the way, is an AMAZING company with a fantastic box! Anyway -I had to cancel cause I have to have cancer removed that we just found on my head and i will need to have 2 surgeries back to back. I contacted Focallure by email to cancel my subscription for now because it says that I can cancel AT ANY TIME!!! They said that my excuse for not ""complying"" with the terms was not a good enough reason but, it says you can cancel anytime! This popped up unexpectedly and I cannot afford another DIME FROM MY POCKET! I am in shock that this company is acting this way! They even told me that I needed to pay for my next month and I could then CALMLY cancel. WHATTTTT????? Im so pissed off that I am crying! I cant take this!"
1174,2,"Paid the $6.95 for the first box free no where did it state that they will have to charge me the second box. it says I can cancel anytime. then my box comes, and items are not worth it at all. There's no phone number to get in contact with them. the customer service are rude as hell. I'm done I'm over it. I'm a Ipsy customer all the way."
1175,2,I ordered four items 4/25/19 and I realized today I got my postal code wrong. I emailed asking if I could get a refund and reorder with the right zip code. I received a email from customer service that they WILL NOT give me a refund because they are incapable of processing refunds right now even though the order hasn't shipped or a shipping label even made. And a snippy note at the bottom about double checking info. My phone has auto correct. Does anyone know if this means my package will never come at all? I have never in my life had this happen with a company! I'm so bummed I just want my money back. I don't have money to waste on items I'll never use.
1176,1,I ordered makeup brushes several weeks ago. Money was taken immediately and I was sent a shipping confirmation. The tracking number pulled up no information. I emailed after a couple of weeks passed and I was given a second tracking number that pulled up no information. Now they won't reply to my emails and they don't answer the phone when I try to call. Do not order from this company.
1177,2,"Do yourself a favor and depending where you live, you are WAY better off walking into your local beauty store for the things you need. When checking out, I saw that there was an option to pay for ""2 day"", now normally, when you order from any other website, if you pay for ""2 day"" that means that it will be at your house within 2 days. I have ordered from BH Cosmetics before and I am already familiar with their products and they aren't ANYTHING DIFFERENT from your fav beauty shop. Upon emailing BH's customer service, I explained to them why I was upset with my package still being processed even though I paid extra to have it shipped early. I was told that that is normal and I'm sorry but it really isn't because I have never had this issue with any other business, nor would I ever bother paying extra for something to get to my house earlier when it isn't going to be here earlier lol I could understand if their products are out of this world, and I can also understand if it even said something in fine print, but no I will not be a customer any longer."
1178,1,"Truly horrible customer service. Even to customers who have made half a dozen purchases. When something goes wrong (they sent lipsticks that are misproductions) they expect the customer to PAY for return shipping when the mistake is theirs. I have no problem returning, but I have a HUGE problem paying to return something that should have been pristine!"
1179,1,"I am from Dubai, UAE. I ordered from their site and after a week they informed that they shipped the products. Its been a month since then and i have been regularly trying to follow up with them, as the package is still in London for some reason. Since i am an internatioanal customer i cannot contact usps, regarding the shipping and only they can help me out. Unfortunately they have not even tried once to sort it out. My package is lost and there is no refund either. Their customer service is the worst. Please don't order from them."
1180,2,"It took so long to receive! Amd when it finally arrives, the shades were completely off then what i ordered. And my glasses bristles were damaged. I tried to fix them with washing but it only fixed it partially so i had to purchase a separate brush from another cosmetic retailer.... long story short. I was so fed up, i gave them away."
1181,3,"I ordered 5 products from this company. 2 out out of 3 eyeshadows were crumbled because they were not properly packaged. In the past week I have attempted to call their customer service 4 times without an answer. They obviously do not have enough people working. Each time I am told by an automated system everyone is busy, I will recieve a call back etc. I also tried email through the contact form on their website with no reply after 3 days. I regret ordering from their site and wish I had just ordered their products through another retailer."
1182,2,"I wanted to buy their new line of liquid suede lipsticks online. They were sold out for MONTHS. I emailed them a while ago to ask if they were coming back in stock, or if they had been limited edition. They never replied. I also asked them on facebook. They never replied. 10/10 customer service. Now SOME (not all!) of the lipsticks are back in stock and I don't even feel like buying them anymore. I'm sure the quality is great. The customer service is just nonexistent."
1183,2,"I purchased 5 products from NYXcosmetics.com. 4 of them were sealed, but 1 lipstick was not. I called their customer service and was told that ALL of their online products are unused, and some items are not sealed. Well, I ordered 2 lipsticks, why would 1 be sealed but 1 not?? I just found that didn't sit right. The rep told me to send them a photo of it, but didn't tell me what they were going to do about it: replace it? have me send the unsealed product back? it was rather vague and he insisted that it was unused so it seemed as if the company did not deem it an issue. I wasn't in the mood to go through all the hoops, it was less than $5 and I could use alcohol and a napkin to wipe off the outer layer to be safe (although messy and ruined the look of the lipstick). But, then I keep getting upset whenever I use that lipstick, and then it struck me: Why would a company RUIN my purchase experience and make me do extra work to ensure good hygiene? If I ever want NYX makeup again, I will just go to CVS from now on where I can CHOOSE a sealed item, and CVS often has sales too. The only reason I shopped online is because of a new product that just came out and sometimes CVS does not have the shade I want."
1184,3,"I've had a couple of issues with Avon years ago, but this one is more recent. Last year, a bit before Christmas, I tried placing an order with a friend (K.C.) and I used her link and well, I know how to order online guys, come on.
So anyways, I got a confirmation email and it said, thanks for your order, from (T.N.) an old consultant (ex friend). So I called Avon and said this is not right, I used K.C.'s link, not T.N. Why is this happening, Can you please fix this?! Avon AGREED to fix the issue, and swap my order under the correct person aka K.C.
Later I learned that K.C. had blocked me and said that I lied about ordering from her, that she called Avon, and Avon told her that I never called to make the order right. But I most certainly did.
Avon, apparently has done this similar thing to other consultants, I later learned after making a post about this whole thing. Avon not only messed up my order, lied to me about fixing it, but also lied to the ex-friend, Avon also cost me her friendship.
Avon is not a good company to work for or order from. This may seem ""silly"" to some of you, but to me it's not silly at all.
I think Avon needs to contact K.C. and tell her they lied to us both and at least make right, what they did wrong. I mean, not only did they cost me a friendship, but I have a great reputation going for me. I don't do anyone wrong to even deserve this sort of thing, I'm a very very good person, especially in the business world."
1185,3,I've been using Avon products for many years. I have always been very happy with the product and its packaging. But I must say I really don't like the new packaging as I think it looks very cheap and tacky!! .... Why have Mark written access it !!!!! Sorry Avon but your making your products look cheap and nasty.
1186,1,"According to their customer service, THEY DO NOT VERIFY CHECKING ACCOUNTS BEFORE PRINTING YOUR CHECKS, and told me word for word that you can order checks for any account you want! They also refuse to admit to, or pay the fee for, THEIR misprinting error! I feel a huge company who's been around as long as Vistaprint should stand by their products, and their customers, rather than deflect responsibility, I have been back and forth with them on this and get NOTHING but fake empathy and flimsy excuses, but no resolution (oh and did I mention what they can do with their store credit for new checks?!) Therefore, I am now on a mission to cost them as much money in lost business as they have cost me in bank fees!
So lets put this to public opinion... their version suggests I put 6 extra zeroes preceding my account number, when NONE actually exist, and that I also left off the last digit when entering and triple checking my account number on their website (this of course caused the check I wrote to be returned by the bank ""unable to locate account"") They also claim NOTHING was verified with my bank prior to printing when I said it HAD to have been correct at that point! Now I don't claim to know how checks are made, but I do have some knowledge of data processing and financial documents, and MY version, also my bank's theory, is that THEIR system added the extra zeroes to fill in the extra digit spaces on the checks, thereby DROPPING the last digit of my account number when they printed them, costing a disabled fixed budget $175 in fees AND a perfect rental history... which version sounds more viable to you?? So you decide for yourself if you trust your financial documents to a company that operates, and treats people and their livelihoods this way, I no longer will... or you can go ahead and commit bank fraud, Vistaprint will help you!!"
1187,1,"Quality consistency was poor. Most didn't match proof at all. On many, there was no left and/or top border, others had no top border and others were way off centre.
Chat rep didn't allow me to explain that they were more than just off-centre (the cut was the real problem). With a rude and argumentative tone, the blame was placed on me. With the limitations of the design tool, the white space was centred as much as possible (within pixels, zoomed at 500%) the rep didn't even ask to see the quality of the cards that I received. I was happy with my proof and the slight, barely noticeable imperfection, but most of the cards received did not replicate my proof, so much so I actually laughed.
Was promised that they'd fix it up and order a new batch and I'll receive it in 2 days. NOTHING. The chat transcript wasn't even sent to my email and when I went to get the transcript from my account, it was never there so I can't defend myself.
Scum of a company."
1188,3,"I was looking to put an order in for Spot UV Business Cards as their pricing was very reasonable (on sale for $37cad for 500 qty). The only problem was - I want to submit a separate file to indicate where the gloss will be printed (as you would with any other print company out there) and there was no way for me to do that with their submission process.
I spoke to a ""specialist"" via live chat for an hour and it absolutely went NO WHERE. Not only did she have no clue about the printing nor design process of Spot UV while pretending she did, she started giving me attitude in the end by saying, ""this is why you should have shown me your designs first"" when I was only looking to get answers before finalizing my files. In the end, her solution was for me to spend extra money on design help when I didn't need any.
I spoke to a second ""specialist"" via phone the next day, hoping to get a more direct answer from someone with actual knowledge on the topic of printing. At this point, I should have gone with another print company already. He had no clue either. I showed him a mock-up of what I want as my final product and he didn't even know what a mock-up was, assuming it was the print file itself saying, ""your design is crooked."" Needless to say, I gave up at this point.
Vistaprint, how about having ""specialists"" who actually specializes in the services you provide? Thank you."
1189,1,This site is a disaster. The so-called designers have NO CREATIVE ABILITY. Most or amateurs at best. I spent 650.00 and got a bunch of crap. DO NOT GAURANTTEE payment or you will be screwed out of your money. This site is too complicated to navigate. They are there to take the most money from you that they can by promising things they cannot deliver.STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE. YOU WILL NOT COME OUT HAPPY. I gave up finally and had to reward a designer the win after I ended up doing the design myself. NEVER< NEVER >AGAIN will I use this site. Most of the good reviews I believe are fake reviews. Find you a REAL GRAPHIC ARTIST locally to do your work. IT WILL PAY OFF. I am having to take what I got form them and have it redone. THEY ARE AWFUL!!!!!!!
1190,1,"I would NOT recommend this firm for your logo needs. It's confusing, demanding and difficult. The staff within Customer Service does not understand the English language and they're incredibly rude.
I've demanded a full refund and maybe involving my corporate lawyer to retrieve a full refund for work that was promised and not delivered."
1191,1,"designhill are thieves, do not pay the designers some work, it is a constant practice in them, I have the experience of a job, contact the person who requested the design, I assure you that I release the payment and was never credited, to top of the highs came a mail of designhill ensuring that the payment is released but never credited to the account of the designer, are scammers and must be reported to the competent authorities to get to clarify the facts."
1192,3,"I am from Indiana and decided to go to a helicopter conference in California, at the Robinson Helicopter Company. Since I have a helicopter business, I decided that I needed to take business cards with me to hand out with special pricing. I went on the web and found overnightprints.com and actually saw that they had an overnight shipping option. I ordered the business cards on March 7th, 2019 and was happy to see that there was a guaranteed delivery date on check out for March 8th. I left for my conference on March 10th and followed tracking to see that the business cards arrived my home in INDIANA on March 11th! When I contacted the company, explaining that the point of having overnight business cards was to have them with me for the conference, they offered to refund part of the shipping. They just did not get the big picture! The business cards had special pricing for this event on them. When I returned home after the conference, I had a box of worthless cards! $61.41 wasted!"
1193,1,"Poorly cut, looks like in a rush. They Won't refund or remake the order. Every business cards has a different cut. Go to VISTAPRINT, where if they make a mistake they will fix it, no questions asked.
The preview looks totally different from what I have received. And they hide behind policies for a poorly done job."
1194,3,"After 500 defective business cards were shipped to me I reached out to Customer Service I sent detailed pictures and written explanation about the uneven white lines that randomly appear in different width on each card. I also spoke with the ""Customer Care Specialist"" Tatyana Zabolotneva and she wrote back to me that it is my fault having the linessince I skipped the professional review during my order. I did skip the ""Professional Review"" step because I am sending a standard size business cards. Either way there is no logic that explains the lines which have different width on each and every single card- back and front. Please see attachments!
Last but not least I reached out to the Customer Care person for a third time and I would expect at lease a response from a company to which I started giving my business since year 2012. I wrote that I really don't want to leave a bad review but there was no further response, so this is my review!"
1195,1,"Ordered a swim suit and never got the package because they changed my mailing zip code! Now no one responds to my emails requesting a refund!! They billed to the correct zip, which is the same as my shipping zip code, and the payment went through with the correct zip, but they literally changed my shipping address zip code! When I called the number associated with their company, they said that they can't do anything and I would have to email the support center. I have emailed them and they won't respond to my emails to refund me. They are a scam!!! DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM! They should not be in business, they are not a ligament company. Do not support this company!"
1196,1,"WARNING: VERY BAD COMPANY, PLEASE STAY AWAY. SAVE MONEY DEAL WITH OTHER.
They didn't finish what we want, Requested refund within the 30 days, they refused, called me names and used vulgar language during the phone call. Needless to say, they refused again to refund and have since disputed the charges. Avoid this company at all costs."
1197,1,"Awful!!!! The logo I paid for and downloaded was different to the one I designed. The majority of the files wouldnt even open, rubbish customer service, 100% dissatisfied. Do not use this company unless you want to waste your time and money."
1198,1,"Attempted to use this company to design a logo. Took weeks to get designs, the designs were terrible, sent in for revisions only to get new designs that looked almost exactly as the first ones. Requested refund within the 30 days, they refused, called me names and used vulgar language during the phone call. Needless to say theyes refused again to refund and have since disputed the charges. Avoid this company at all costs."
1199,3,"I paid over $3000 for logos on this website where each logo cost me $99. This option is supposed to give you ""Graphic Protection"" and remove the graphic from the database. My graphics were NEVER removed and it was always available for anyone to purchase again. I spoke to Graphic Springs about this and they pretended like they didn't know about this. For 2 years since my purchases, I am pretty sure these guys knew well what they were doing. When I first bought my logos, we encountered some technical problems where the logo was not removed from their website as it was supposed to be, and I just overlooked it thinking its not their fault, but 2 years later, there is my logos again, ALL 30 of them! Youre telling me for 2 years you did not notice nor was able to sort this error out? I call that suspicious activity. Since they did not want to honor their Graphic Protection contract, I asked for a refund, because well you get refunds for technical errors right? WRONG! That's apparently not how it works with these guys. If you have ANY TECHNICAL PROBLEMS with their graphics, they will BLAME the problem on you. But wait, it gets better, not only are they breaching their contract, they have been RECYCLING THEIR DESIGNS and calling them unique. When I called them out on this and questioned why my logos look so much like these other ones they are selling, they said they have the right to REUSE parts of the design. Um, excuse me? You are basically copying and pasting the designs I bought and slapping an additional element to it. So much for calling yourselves ""graphic designers"". I told them to refund me my money for the Graphic Protection cost minus the cost of a Standard option where graphics do not get removed from the database and they chose to ignore me."
1200,2,"Their site gives off the impression that you are able to create a free logo. Once you create your logo and go to download it, they shove a hard-coded script at you saying that other people are looking at your logo and that you should secure it right that instant or it could be taken.
Anyone who thinks it's okay for someone to spend half an hour on building something unique to themselves and then threatening to take it away from them should be put in check. Will never use this site."
1201,3,I purchased $ 99 package and none of my files will download but one of them. Once the download it says the file has been renamed or deleted. What is going on.. how can this be fixed. I needed this logo to print a 14 ft banner tomorrow.
1202,1,"The limitations, poor service, even after escalations, the refusal to refund when satisfaction just wasn't achieved even after I expressed that the same day as purchase is subpar to so many other services out there. It's really disappointing to me that wordpress has opted to pair with this service. I'll be making my recommendations to wordpress to consider switching to a better software or service. Please don't waste your money, people... your hard earned money!"
1203,2,"They finally provided the corrected social media files later that day, after I decided to complain. After all, I am a paying customer that would like to receive what I bought and paid for. The whole ordeal wasted a lot of my time and not worth all the hassle."
1204,1,"Do Not do business with LogoJoy.
After reading other online reviews (after the fact) about this company, other people feel the same way I do. I purchased a logo from them, luckily at sale price. I was so excited and things were going great and customer service started out great but Wham! Things quickly went down hill, everybody stopped responding to my emails, even the owner, and it was taking forever for tech support to try and fix the issue with my logo files. Which by the way, never was fixed, evidently it's beyond their scope. And they didn't bother to give me updates. I got took, lesson learned and I'm moving on. Just want to warn everybody else.
The issue: a symbol image in my logo would not show up or download with some of my logo files and they never could fix it. In the process they messed up other versions of my logo files. LOL! The whole situation has been going on for over a week and it's been very disappointing and laughable too. Plus, they did not allow me to download the fonts that I used in my logo, only similar versions.
I sent the following farewell email to the Owner and the staff:
""Hello all.
Just wanted to say that LogoJoy quickly turned into LogoDisappointment. You all started out great, responsive and helpful but then went all the way down hill. But hey, seems like no one there cares, even the owner. Take their money and forget about them and don't complete their purchase. So, I no longer care and I'll write off my messed up purchase as a Huge Mistake and Rip Off. Lesson learned and glad I had only paid the sale price. I intended to do more business with you but no way in heck now and I'll be sure to let lots of other people know too.
This has been a huge joke so thanks for the laughs."""
1205,1,"I paid for a logo package to make my logo idea in the required format for marketing materials (I sent the logo design idea that I created to them trusting they were honest). I was very engage with them and even made the edits of the design myself (in power point) to make the process easier and they only needed to make the changes in their logo design software/photoshop. All the logo idea was mine from start to finish. While working on this, they charged my credit card $280 without my authorization and when I told them I placed a fraud claim with my bank they quickly replied they will reimburse and to please inform my bank to close out the investigation. After this my trust continued to go down the hill so at this point I decided to contact USPTO to do the copyrights/trademark registration instead of working that portion with them (Octa Logo / OctaGroup), however at the end when I got my final product they wanted to charge me $300 for copyrights services and threaten me saying they will open a legal case against me ignoring the logo was all my idea and not theirs. Do not trust this company. They will take your idea/design and make it theirs to then try to charge you and make money out of it. Sometimes if something looks to good or too cheap, is for something bad, is a scam and is not legit.
Below is the person that assisted me during this nightmare. OctaLogo and DesignProficient work hand to hand based on what he told me. He contacted me after I accessed OctaLogo website and I got confused because he was under a different company name but he explained to me that both companies are the same and that's why both pages (https://www.octalogo.com/ and https://www.designproficient.com/) have actually the same logo packages.

What a nightmare dealing with unprofessional people playing games and covering each other. I was so excited to get this done and trusted them but sadly they ended up to be SCAMMERS!
CUSTOMERS PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM https://www.octalogo.com/ and https://www.designproficient.com/. SCAM!!!!!!!!!"
1206,2,"This company was great at first. But then everything went down hill quickly. At first hey took the time to listen to me and works well in completing the job in a good time frame.
But then everything went wrong. I still don't have my trademark. Things are really unprofessional. I will not use them again and am very sorry if my review in the past mislead people."
1207,3,"I  was recently looking for a company to design a logo for my small business. I ran across ""DesignProficient"", which I now understand is also grouped with OctaLogo, Logo Scientist, Octavideo and who knows what else. I paid my $89.00 and then I was assigned a Project Manager who called himself James Black. I told him he sounded like he was from India or Pakistan and he acted offended and said he hated that place (India) and hated the people. Then when I said Pakistan he asked had I ever heard of anyone named James Black from Pakistan. I told him I didn't think that was his name anyway because it was American. He then spun a yarn that he was from Paris and so was his mother but his father was American. He then began what was a campaign to try and convince me to allow them to create a website for me. He just wouldn't let up. I told him I had to talk it over with my husband and I would want him to speak to my husband. We set up an appointment to conference call and after the call was over my husband said it was a scam. He had asked James for a SOW (statement of work) outlining milestones and costs and he sends me this poor excuse for an invoice. Then he kept asking me how many years I wanted to apply for the copyright for my logo. Well I didn't need a copyright it was a trademark. When he wasn't getting me to move on that or the website I didn't hear from him for a day, so my husband said i wasn't going to get the logo I paid for. I came up with a scam to scam the scammers. I wrote him and told him my husband wouldn't invest because he didn't think they were legitimate after reading some negative reviews. I said I had read them too but I know you can't please all the people all the time and that I had taken money out of my 401K but he was starting to make me nervous because I had received nothing from them to make me trust them. I immediately heard from him the next day and he did give me all the files for my logo. I then told him while I really liked him I had an offer from someone else to do a website for me for a 1/3 of his cost. Well he has given me three additional discounts since down. We are now down to 899.00 from 3,250.00. Yeah Right. I had also told him I needed to see verifiable websites his company had done the work on. He gave me a list of about 6 and the very first one on the list belongs to Sherrod Egypt a TV personality and real estate agent. I called her today and was told the name of the company who designed her website and it wasn't DesignProficient or OctaLogo or Logoscientist. The company is called ""The Design People) Agent Image and they work almost exclusively on real estate agents websites. I spoke to Gregg who is the vice president and he asked me to send him the emails I had received from James. I am just so glad that I didn't fork over the $3250.00 or even a portion of it. I would have been devastated. Maybe some of the positive reviews on here are legitimate and those people were the lucky ones but I would say don't take a chance because you might be added to the list of those on here who's experience was unfortunate."
1208,1,"We have worked with Infoway for about two years on our development project. Through lies and false promises, they have prolonged what was initially a six month project into two years. They have continued to take and request payments, yet the work was never completed and error prone.
After requesting a refund per their website and numerous promises by Amitava Ghosh, they have stopped answering our calls, Skype calls, and continue to prolong our development.
They represent that they are a U.S. Company with ties to India, but Infoway is merely a chop shop in India with a false front home office in the U.S. Their owner resides at the Corporate Address in Porter Ranch.
We will be pursuing this matter to the fullest. For any companies or individuals seeking web development work, save yourself the time and money and DO NOT USE INFOWAY. This information will save you countless headache and failure."
1209,2,"I recently had a horrible experience with the company Infoway on Upwork. I worked with them for a month total before ending the project. There were many errors throughout the beginning stages of development but I was patient because I didn't expect a lot of skill for the price I was paying.
Before work began I had negotiated the contract with Piyal and was offered what I felt was a great price for the work I needed done. After telling Piyal I wanted to hire me he proceeded to tell me to hire his company through a different profile that didn't have any feedback. This seemed kind of fishy to me because the only reason I wanted to work with his profile was because he had feedback and I felt the chances of me being scammed were slimmer on an account that had spent so much time building up feedback. I denied Piyal's request to hire the different profile and started the contract with him and began working with a member of his company through email. This persons name was Gourav.
The work from Gourav was acceptable at first even though there were some pretty big errors and misconfigurations up until the project phase #3. At that point I had received an email saying that the ""(Search stores by Radius /Closest Stores + Product List + Cart + Checkout)"" but none of those features really worked right.
There was nowhere for me to put what the stores were in the admin panel so no way for the customer to actually find the store and nothing seemed to happen when clicking the submit button.
There was no Cart in the menu and that's what users would need the option of seeing so that they can checkout.
Once you got to checkout there was no way to actually pay. I said I had wanted it setup like as a delivery service delivery service that accepted cash only and there was no way to pay with this method or any at checkout.
When it came to users being able to enter their address to get it shipped to them there was only a handful of states there, and when selecting your state the city's menu would only show a few cities and was missing a lot.
There were other errors to but these were the main one's.
I pointed these errors out and wasn't receiving a response so I decided since nothing that was supposed to be delivered in Phase #3 was actually done or working, and there were still 2 more Phases to go and now we were getting done with the actual functionality aspects of the website that I would be unsatisfied with the work based on what he was giving me.
He emailed and said that he had forgotten to upload some parts of the code and that he would have it uploaded Monday and I told him no thanks I didn't want to work with him anymore. To me that sounded like a lie because it only takes 5 minutes to actually upload code. He messaged me again Tuesday saying he had completed Phase 3 and I said I had canceled his contract and was done working with him.
He said he had completed 80% of the work but I pointed out that so far everything was simple and now that we were actually getting into functionality it seemed sloppy and I didn't want to keep paying for something I'd have to pay someone else to fix when it's done.
That was the last time I spoke with him and it seemed like I was going to get my refund back until Piyal disputed it at the last hour. From there I began the Upwork dispute resolution process. I was contacted by ""Sam"" from Infoway via email and was asked for clarification about what happened and was told they wanted to offer me a refund. I responded with everything that had happened in detail and didn't hear anything back for a few day. The next email I was told he couldn't reply because he was in the hospital for some reason and that he would like to compensate me by offering my 3 month's of free service management.
To this I told him I had already decided to cease doing business with his company and that I had already had my website completed by another company. He started going on about how I never gave them a chance and it was because of my ""perfectionist ideology"" but that they would refund the last phases milestone. I had to agree to change my feedback in order to get the refund though. Finally at the last hour before we were supposed to go on our call with the Upwork mediator I was contacted by Piyal and told they were going to refund the milestone.
So in regards to overall rating: Design work 0/5 Communication 0/5 Professionalism 0/5 Overall experience 0/5."
1210,1,I hate to leave a negative review for an Australian company because I use to live here. Their designers are really stupid and dumb. They miss spelled my company's name on the logo. You could of even copied and paste it from my brief? Duh? Support doesn't want to help with back and forth useless information. They job is not protect the stupid designers so they too must be stupid. $450 wasted for some idiot and dumb company.
1211,3,"For the first time customer, there is no option to create a ""blind"" contest. All designers can see what other designers are submitting. Then they will wait until the last minute and flood you with similar submissions in the hopes that you irrationally pick theirs. I was also told by a designer to delete certain designs based on rule violations.
Customer service didn't read my emails thoroughly and kept suggesting things that I already disputed. Then once the contest completed (I used guaranteed payout) I've still not heard back from any of them... sad.
The designer we ended up choosing was polite and easy to work with. But, we had 200 submissions of very similar logo's."
1212,1,"Staff use racist and homophobic insults when dealing with disputes. Truly a disgraceful business.
Upon doing a one to one project, the work was so bad it could have been done by a child. Had to laugh it was so bad otherwise the only option is to cry.
There is no way out then, even if the work is bad. You have to pay those disgusting sums of money for work that a toddler could do better.
A scam of a company with a disgusting attitude."
1213,1,"This service is GROSSLY overpriced. The designers don't appear read to read anything about your business and submit substandard designs. To this end, I received lots of designs but 95% of them were garbage. The type of files received at the end, with the exception of the logo are not necessarily usable. To send PDF letterhead in the 21st Century is patently absurd. Who sends letterhead to the printer in 2018? Overall this was a complete waste of hundreds of dollars. If you're going to spend close to $1000, I recommend finding someone else for the job. I wish I had read actual reviews BEFORE I made the purchase. Shame on me! Dont waste your money!!!"
1214,1,"I've been a customer for 10 years. Although my earlier experiences were positive, my opinion has changed drastically during the last few months. I prepaid for a new website design, SEO content, and an app. That was a huge mistake. It's been several months and my website has not been published. The SEO content and app have not yet begun. What's worse, is that I have spoken to support multiple times during the last couple of months. They assure me that the site will be live within a couple of days. It's still not live. Do not prepay for services with this company."
1215,3,"I paid for a website 2 years ago £500 and they started out fine with 2 way conversations, feedbacks and proofs being sent on a weekley basis.
My website was 80% finished and as I was about to agree and make it live they disappear of the face of the earth! Anyone know why or where?
I read a lot of comments that they are scammers etc (I am fumming and would like to believe this) however, if they are, why would they bother doing 80% of the work??? Anyone got any advice???"
1216,1,"We have purchased a great deal of logoed merchandise from LogoUp. In the past, they have been notorious for failing to send out orders within the timeframe they boast about on their webpage. Beyond that, the do not attempt to communicate with their customers about missing their self-set deadlines. That being said, we recently placed another order with them. They were running a decent sale on hats. We were willing to place an additional order with them because we did not need the hats within a specific timeframe - meaning, as per usual, they could be late with their deadline. Much to our surprise, they cancelled our order. My husband contacted them over the phone and they stated that they no longer wanted our business. I am writing a review today because I feel that their lower prices are not worth the headache they invoke for small business owners. All should be made aware that customer service is very low on this company's priority list - pitifully low."
1217,1,"Hello everyone,
I just added my story with ssegold, website that was to deliver me safely.... well I only had problems at the end.
I ordered items and gold for a well-known game. On their site they ask for the name of the characters, server, etc.
And...When reading my emails, what do I see?
""Your password has been changed"" (of my game account).
And the next day another email from the game development studio and team of security :
""Hello,
Your request (1234567: G W X: Warning for unauthorized purchases) has been updated. To add to your request, simply reply to this email. If you need help, please contact us simply by filling out this e-mail stating ""I no longer need help"". ""
In other words, someone denounce me. Because I never sent a request at this well known stutio Ar.
Not only did someone change my password, but apparently, also sent a ticket saying that I was doing unauthorized purchases.I did not tell anyone about these purchases except Ssegold who were to deliver me. But I never got the order !
Since my gaming account was suspended with all the items, money that was there (and that have been deleted).
I asked them (ssegold) for a refund for these items that I could not have, they refuse... it was a big order. And they refused.
Finally ? A suspended account, items I have never seen, and no refund.
Thank you Sse gold.
I started to initiate proceedings with claim.
My order : Order ID(PNO):20190202025758234609"
1218,1,I bought gold from here and was told to wait 30 minutes and they would email me when ready. I wanted a couple of hours and sent 2 emails and got no response. I then received a call a call after waiting 4-5 hours. I then talked on the phone with a person and was given instruction on what to do. They ended up scamming me as they gave me the money but told me to trade it back because they were going to trade me a larger amount for the long wait. I stupidly enough did and they logged out. I then complained and they sent a screen shot saying they did and told me to take it up with there manager on discord and gave me a username who doesn't even exist. So save yourself the time and don't use them and save 5 hours of your life and your money.
1219,1,"Ugh...here's another one of those Chinese WoW gold sellers that scams its customers. This should sound familiar to many people: 1) You ask live chat if they have gold in stock; 2) They tell you ""Yes, we have 1234 G in stock (1234 is always 1000 to 10000 G greater than what you asked for); 3) You ask live chat how long until delivery; 4) They tell you 10-30 minutes (or occasionally up to 2 hours); 5) You place the order and *BANG* now no gold is in stock and the manager is out of the office, town, never there so no refund. 6) If you ever get your gold, it's because you harangued the live chat and filed a complaint with your credit card or paypal; 7) When everything is done you realize that with the amount of time you spent chasing your order, you could have been in the game grinding and earned what you had orderd.
This company is related to ssegames.com and just like www.power-level.net.AVOID AVOID AVOID."
1220,1,"Ordered Items from them for Christmas. Now told Items on backorder and may not come until after Christmas. Called Customer Service, they are of no help and couldn't tell status of most items ordered. Credit card shows charges of $40 dollars over amount order was supposed to be! Whole operation at this retailer seems to be out of control, right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. I would recommend using other retailers and avoid ToyRus if possible. Sorry for being so negative, but they don't seem to have their act together."
1221,1,"Their system errors out on the shipping address and now they cant cacel the order or correct the shipping address. What kind of company cant correct a shipping address or cancel an order?! Basically on out my money for the order and there is nothing they can do.
Hope someone at that random address likes the toys I bought them. Wassupposed to go to a toy drive at work.
They deserve the bankruptcy they are going through. Good riddance."
1222,2,"Ordered my gift items on the Dec 21.To ensure that they will get here on time I paid for expedited shipping.
The website advertised this option as 2 day shipping so I would be getting them on Dec 23. Nope. Called both Toys R Us and FedEx numerous times. Instead I was flat out told by FedEx that the packages were never dropped off.
My final call to Toys R Us, I was told nonchalantly that I will be getting them Tuesday. If you guys can't fulfill shipping obligations why lie or advertise it. Now I have to wait until Tuesday for my kids to open up the rest of their gifts.
Never again. Horrible customer service."
1223,2,"I have been buying codes from offgamers for a few years now and only recently did I encounter a problem with their code. I bought a USD100 Google Play gift card, and as usual I would copy the code and paste it in the redeem page. Instead of redeeming the USD100, I was told the code was already redeemed. How is that even possible when it wasn't even 15-20secs after I got the code?
I did what any upset customer would do, contacted their support team. It took them 5 days to get back to me, which I understand since it was the weekend. Then all I got was a reply telling me that it was confirmed the code was redeemed on the same day and asked me to check again if any of my family could have used the code. In short, they're not taking any responsibility for it. I am the only person who can access my account, the code only shows in my account and not in any email.
So I believe there is only 2 reasons this could have happened. They did indeed send me a used code (maybe used by one of their staffs), or their security is weak that it was hacked. I am not taking any further risks with OFFGAMERS! USD100 is not a small amount! Buy from OFFGAMERS at your own risk. I'm done with them!"
1224,1,"Got scammed $100, company does not claim responsibility, hires part timers to deal with support, never once answers question with seriousness, threatens. Offered 'goodwill' to resell your unusable code to others, meaning you might have just bought an unused code from someone else? To even write such a bull$#*! email, they have just exposed themselves. Takes days to reply you but request you to reply within 24hrs from them sending out to you a flawed email template.Please do not fall for their scam tactics. As a silly victim myself, i will do and show everyone i can to stop them."
1225,1,this company is a joke they make you wait 30 minutes then tell you up to 48 hours for verification...they lie about the fees from Pay-Pal and say there are none yeah.. there are $5.00 US per... they refund you back the Pay-Pal but get this it could take up to 14 days to get your cash back... meanwhile your out the money and the items... so never use this site to purchase anything ... all the good reviews they have are the company itself creating fake reviews.... under fictitious names... way more bad reviews than good the bad ones are from real people... DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY AT ALL EVER.
1226,3,You should have a second person checking that the items are correct. I ordered short shafts. 10 sets of one kind. And 5 sets of another. All of them are medium. I have zero use for.
1227,2,I have ordered items off of this site before. This time I noticed that the minimum shipping price was up 15 more dollars then the last time I ordered something. Also I paid $35 for over night and didn't get it till two days later. The worst part is standard shipping is almost $12 and that's for a 4 to 7 business's days. I spent $100 in total equipment which the free shipping is at $45 but the last time I did standard shipping it took well over two weeks to reach me. I like the site its very easy to navigate but the shipping is terrible. When ordered it said I would have my packages by 4:30pm. Then when I tracked my Package and seen that I would not be receiving them till a day or two later so I naturally contacted the website. The first email I got from them was telling me that it depended on my location for the time of delivery so almost saying I was in the wrong. It was not a great experience and they should not put certain times on there as it didn't apply to me so I over paid for a promise on them and got a $20 credit on the site when I spent with shipping almost $150 with them. Not to happy I will use a physical store or a different website from now on.
1228,2,"The website and how fast the ship was great. I was really happy with the product I purchased. A set of harrows darts. Being excited about my purchase, I make a post on reddit thinking I'll just show off a little. Only what I got was being told that I paid almost double what I could have got for on UK website. Something about US retailers are known to be way overpriced. Thought I had a solid site to use but I paid 110 for darts that should have been 60. Lesson learned."
1229,1,"Back in the day, IGN was one of the good video game review sites, but now, it's nothing more than a joke. The reviews these days are horrible, as IGN will give good ratings to Call Of Duty games while any game involving Sonic The Hedgehog gets a bad review. One Kirby game got a low score because of the complaint about the campaign being short (which is kind of expected from a Kirby game). This is not a site for those looking for honest reviews."
1230,1,"This site makes it obvious that they trade early access for good reviews. They will rate the worst bull$#*! a 8/10, just to keep the money flowing.
Bad, untrustworthy, hyping games that are crap... this site is all that is awful and sad about the games industry.
IGN Scale goes from 6/10 = utter garbage and game dev that cannot help us get money to 9/10 average to 10/10 good. This site is literally a scam in that regard.
I have spent a lot of money on $#*! games based on reviews from this site."
1231,1,"IGN is one of the most well known video game review sites in America, and across the Globe. This is the unfortunate fact for any gamer that is not that knowledgable in the field of video games, for they would be fooled by every review posted by IGN. They recommend games that reek of cancer and 12 year old squeakers, such as any modern Call Of Duty game. There are not enough memes in the world to cure some of the reviews I have had to read on IGN. The fact that they give reviews like 8/10s and above to games that are simply copies of the past year with slightly better graphics. 7.8/10 on Pokemon ORAS for too much water???? How much worse can you get at reviewing a game that was just fine? If you have the money of the Triple A companies, enough email accounts and determination, you will be able to stick your hand up IGN's butt and make them your puppet. They will say anything for COD games for the right price, such as giving it a higher rating them games that have actual decent storylines. 9/11 was an inside job, and every day we stray further from God's light. Thanks."
1232,1,Do not rent games here. My mom was banned for a stupid reason. She was banned because we didn't return a game that was supposed to returned a while ago. Guess what! We returned it. We didn't return it because we couldn't find it. But that still didn't get her unbanned. What's stupid is that they don't send you the case unless you decide to actually keep the game. Which costs extra. That's about it.
1233,2,I had used this gamefly.com service for renting more games. I love to game in my free hours. But this service is very slow and also not giving a bit discount for their users. I cut the membership due to this reasons. I hate to use very slow sites especially for gaming.
1234,2,"Great if you don't mind playing the older games. I've had Madden 16 in my queue for 3 months, and never got to play it. They need to stock up of lose customers...oh, like me, I quit the sight just before writing this review."
1235,1,I am regular customer until they sent me used gift card. I contacted them and they told me to contact steam ( which I did ) and they told me it's used gift card so I sent them the emails with steam. they told me they will get back with me ASAP so after one week I write them back and they told me the same. after 10 days I write them back without any response from them !!! today I write them also without any response. I write bad reviews in there website and they don't publish them. they are scam so just avoid them. I forward all the emails to the customer protecting to deal with them.
1236,1,"It puzzles me that PayPal trusts that my purchase is made by me, on my known (to them) devices, yet these clowns want blood (and DNA results... and, probably, more) before they'll sell you a gift card. I accept that they may be a global organization and it has to be careful about opening new accounts, but PayPal is a global organization, too. There really should be a ""zero stars"" ratings on these review sites, because that is what MyGiftCardSupply would get.
It really bothers me that they have my picture IDs. I've been shopping online fore years and have never (before) been asked for those when making purchases or opening accounts. I major concern is identity theft, of course. Maybe selling IDs is how they make their real money!
How could they have possibly gotten the 5-star rating that they show on their site? Almost 23K ""certified reviews"". HA! It's hard to believe they've sold that many gift cards, much less have that many perfectly satisfied customers. Stolen identities, maybe.
I was looking at their ""Meet Our Team"" page. It doesn't say where the founder (Sam) and the systems tech (Naveed) are from, but they're more than willing to share that the other three live in Chile and Bangladesh. (Doesn't that give you a feeling they support world peace!?!) I don't trust that the photos of ""them"" are real. Maybe they are photos of real people whose identities they've stolen... people who once tried to buy gift cards from them & had to upload photo IDs.
I agree with other reviewers, here, that say they make you jump through hoops, give blood, walk on water, and it is not enough to get gift cards. There is no company, no purchase, that is worth all this hassle. GO ELSEWHERE!"
1237,1,We purchased $150 in GameStop gift cards and when we went to use them we were told that we were supposed to keep the receipt from when we purchased the card because there's a special code hidden there. The company only auto-replies to messages and says if you don't have the receipt that they can't help you and they keep your money. The gift cards are not activated at the register like every other gift card in the world. This is a complete scam and this company should be sued for these practices.
1238,1,"Selling accounts to share games may not be ILLEGAL but it IS against Xbox terms of service which means they can delete your account if you are found to be using this service to play games. It is also unethical, as you take ownership of nothing apart from the login details.
Also you recieve NO ownership of the game, only access to an account which can be revoked at any point and from what I am reading, has been on many occasions.
This company and others like it DO NOT give refunds and as a consumer you have NO rights if you give them your money. DO NOT BE CONNED BY THESE PEOPLE, IT IS A SCAM TO TAKE YOUR MONEY."
1239,1,"Day by day, one by one. Was agreed with their manager one thing, after couple of months when they took enough money start locking all the games I bought. Instantly they changed TOS and said warranty 30 days without prior notice and even affeceted items bought before changing of TOS. Manager not respoding. 20000 Euros damages ... Scam from A to Z! You scammers from buygames can contact me on email because you know it very well. You scammer blocked my account on your website so I can not retrieve accounts to check is there anything working left ... I have all proof for all people here. Maybe I will even create website showing it. Low life on Earth! SCAM!"
1240,3,I bought game ( uncharted collection ) and I got email and password but it doesnt work . My ps4 is saing on the account : The sing-in ID or password is not correct.I tried the account like 5-10 times and it doesnt work. So far my experience is bad with this site.
1241,3,The sent me a completely wrong order a week ago. I called &advised immediately. They said they would rush out the correct order. NOW they are saying they did not and forgot to send the lable to return their mistake. Not my error! Once again theirs. I no longer need the order I purchased it elsewhere. They will not allow me to cancel my original order and will not refund. Their answers are inconsistent. They are unprofessional and an absolute mess.
1242,1,"Got a $50.00 GC to Gamestop for Christmas. On the night of the 26th, went to their website to get the digital code for RD2. Used the GC and charged the balance to my CC. No download code ever came. Called customer service in the morning, spoke to some Indian lady for 30 minutes. Said she had to fill out a form and I would receive a call and my digital code within 24 hours. Call never came, so I called this early afternoon. Different agent, same answer. I have to fill out a form, but you will receive a call with a code in 24 hours. Horrible customer service experience. Told them they could keep their 50 dollar GC, just wanted my money back on my card. Should have sold the card for 40.00 dollars and went to Amazon to shop. Won't be back again. My advice is stay away unless you love speaking to someone you can barely understand and you will get the run around if something does go wrong with your order."
1243,1,"I ordered the Nintendo Switch Bundle on Cyber Monday, with a $50 dollar Gamestop giftcard, and a supposed $35 eShop card. The gift card didn't work when I placed my order online. It was valid, but was not applied to the final cost in my cart. I tried 4 times. How can a company in 2018, have a website where gift cards don't work right? I had to wait on hold for over an hour. I was told that I couldn't cancel my order, or be refunded the $50 that I was overcharged. To add insult to injury, ""upon reviewing your order, this order did not include a $35 eShop credit"". Worst company ever. Gamestop loses another customer, but they don't care anyway. Take your business elsewhere, or risk being ripped-off."
1244,1,"My fiance just bought a Lapras off this website. 3 hours later he logs on to his pokemon account and the lapras is there. He's very happy for it. 30 seconds later he tries to catch some pokemon and they keep running away, he tries to do pokestop and can't do anything. We check his Google account to see if anyone is logined into his account and someone so happens to be using his account. Which we realize why he can't do anything on his pokemon account. My fiance than checks his pokemon items... how in the world does he loose 137 regular potions, 72 super potions, 127 revives, 122 regular pokeballs and now 7 remaining, 156 greatballs now 18 remaining, and lost 135 ultraballs... myself and my fiance wrote them about his account... these people are really rude and aren't trusted at all...DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM!!! FYI there own employees give themselves reviews to cover up... my fiance is a Level 34, he knows a lot about pokemon... he plays it none stop... so don't tell him how he is wrong..."
1245,1,"Ordered coins, but not delivered in their posted 10 minute time frame. It was over an hour before delivered and so I was not available to use them when delivered. Asked for refund because the coins were not able to be used since I was not around when they were delivered way past when they said they would. No refund at all because everything was my fault even though they are the ones that took 8 times longer to deliver the coins than their website stated. I have never experienced such terrible customer service."
1246,3,"I placed an order with MMOGAH.com 2 weeks ago and since then I have been waiting for what I payed for. I have submitted 2 tickets for the order placed but have had no response from them though chat or email. Money was taken from my bank account so I contacted the BBB, there has been many reports of Fraud/Scam for that company."
1247,1,"DO NOT ORDER FROM LUCKY VITAMIN.
FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT GET THEIR ORDER PLEASE DOWNRATE THEIR REVIEW.
Order # LV16949915.
Ordered a product but the item was never received.
Week 3.
Checked the first time no response from the support team ticket.
Week 6.
Checked another time through Instagram and told me to wait.
AFTER 2 MONTHS.
Checked a third time then said it cannot be refunded because it was not insured. Terrible service and refund policy."
1248,2,I ordered my favorite protein bars in November. I received a quarter of my order several weeks later. After waiting over 2 months for my order to ship I get a cancellation email with no apologies or attempts to make this right. They wasted over 2 months of my time and did not care one bit. My bars are still available for purchase on the site but are now $10 more per box. Seems like they just did not want to honor the price they advertised. Will NOT do business with them again!
1249,2,"I recently spent about $200 on vitamins and a couple of extra things. I received my shipment within the shipping time frame. I opened the box and all of the vitamins and items I ordered were literally thrown into the box. There was no packing material or anything for cushion. I had quite a few vitamins that are in glass jars. The other bottles that were in it's own box fell out of their box because of how everything gets shifted during shipment (with no cushion).
I decided to email Lucky Vitamins with attached pictures on how items I spent my own hard earned money on were treated. The ticket was opened and I have yet to receive a reply from them. I will definitely be doing business elsewhere and I will not be ordering from this company again. Poor customer service (or should I say non existent?) and their handling of products is extremely poor."
1250,2,"If I could give this crap negative stars I would. I have not been impressed with their overpriced products that you are REQUIRED to buy every single month. You have to spend 35 ""product points"" which is somewhere between $50-80 EACH MONTH. I have been desperately trying to cancel my atrocious membership and they just keep harassing me!!!!! I wish I had never even gotten involved with this disgusting company. Customer service is a joke because they won't cancel your membership.You are supposed to sign a paper that you wish to cancel and send it back to them which I DID and they STILL continue to tell me I'm REQUIRED to buy products from them!! Um...excuse me? No thank you. Never in a million years."
1251,3,"I signed up for Melaleuca about 2 weeks ago. I was told, as a member, I would have to purchase 35 pts worth of product each month. Since there were not many days left in October and the two ladies who signed me up did not say otherwise, I thought my month would start in November. I was wrong!!! The company sent out a pack filled with items I did and did not want. I now owe them $70 (shipping was $15!!!!!). They placed a hold on my account. Since I did not place the order, I did not have the funds in the account to pay for it. I called yesterday to figure out why I had a hold on my account, being that I just signed up with the company. I explained everything to the lady and asked if that order could be cancelled. She said it could not and then asked me when they would receive their payment. I told her I didn't place the order, so I don't know. She said I would receive ""courtesy calls"" until they received payment."
1252,3,"Be sure of what you might use before you get sucked into the monthly shipment. I had boxes for months because I would try to switch what was supposed to come each month. No dice. I got the same crap 3 months in a row. For green cleaning, go with a better brand. This is truly a pyramid scheme for people who sign others up. Their 100% guarantee is only within 90 days so that's not really 100% in my opinion. I simply couldn't use a months worth of product within the month and the variety wasn't that great."
1253,2,"The shake was not bad but I felt over priced for what you were getting. I tried the shake and decided that I did not want to continue my subscription. It is like an act of congress to cancel the subscription. There is no easy way to cancel the subscription, most websites allows users to cancel subscription, but not this one, You have to email the support team and after several emails later with added questions from 310 Nutrition I still don't know if my subscription was cancelled. I feel like they are trying to prevent me from canceling my subscription. It wont even allow me to delete my debit card, however I am thankful the debit card I used expired a few weeks ago so nothing can be charged to it now. I am so disappointed in this companies ethics or lack of. If my debit card had not expired I really don't know what I would have done to get out of this mess."
1254,2,Delivery was one week late and not what I ordered. I ordered 310 shake and received 310 whey. When I called in to complain they said the whey Includes soy and dairy! I am allergic now to Soy and Dairy so I ended up giving the shipment away and feeling very disappointed and cheated!!! I went to Sams Club and purchased some meall replacement products at a much cheaper price!
1255,3,"I have purchased 310 Nutrition several times however, my last order was an absolute nightmare. Long of the short, I never received my order in spite of having tracking information show the order was delivered. I spent well over an hour arguing back and forth with the customer service representative. In the end yes, my order was re-sent and delivered to my home but the amount of time I wasted makes me second guess if it was even worth it.
Last note - the representative who organized the shipment with me had the nerve to indicate that even though I reached out to 310 Nutrition to confirm they had the right address it was ""my responsibility to contact USPS to ensure they have the same delivery address as well"".
Yeah...because that's how shipments with a SHIPPING LABEL work.
Well done 310 Nutrition."
1256,1,This is NOT a safe product to use . Most people get severly addicted to this product ! If you become addicted call the American addiction center . They treat and know how dangerous this product is . Hospitals and doctors do not know the hazards of this product ! It is harmful and dangerous !to get treated to overcome the addiction is hard to find.
1257,1,"I bought Choline Bitartrate - 400 Grams (14.11 Oz) - 99+% Pure in 2015 and ceased purchasing from this flaky company because they promise promo discount codes for honest reviews, yet when I honestly mentioned in a review that I had experienced run-arounds, taking many emails over many days for liftmode.com to admit mistakes they had made. Well theysay they want honest reviews, but if you actually are too honest then they accuse you of being wrong.
After years off I again tried them in 2017 and they are now refusing to honor their promise to give a discount code for an honest review.
So I know they both go back on their word and cause a customer ridiculous amountsof time getting open communication from them.
Liftmode does not currently offer the better, more expensive forms of choline, instead only the bitartrate form.
Better companies are BulkSupplements.com and nootropicsdepot.com."
1258,3,"1. Green Tea Extract is only available in sizes 5 grams for $7.88 and 300 grams for $33.88. The sample size is ridiculously expensive and the 300 grams package is way too much. I can't pay $33.88 for something I will never be able to use completely, and besides that, since I send it to myself to the Netherlands via a mail forwarder, a 300 grams package would add greately to the freight costs.
2. The delivery information page states that I have free UPS 2nd Day Air shipping if the value of my order after discounts is above $100. I assembled my order, but the free UPS 2nd Day Air shipping was not available. I contacted support and sent them two emails and they replied, saying that the $100 number is an error and I'm eligible for free UPS 2nd Day Air shipping only if my order is above $120. He also stated that it always has been so. In the email he quoted the delivery page and even there in his email it was $100, right below his statement about $120. I had to remove from the cart $17 worth of goods and pay for UPS 2nd Day Air shipping instead.
3. I tried to pay with my debit card. It didn't work because of some mismatch. I decided to pay with crypto instead. Later, I received an SMS that my bank account was charged. I contacted support immediately and after some questions and answers he said that in their system the transaction appears declined. He also said that it might be an authorization, so I was patient. Four days later nothing changed, since the transaction was complete, so I contacted the support again and after a delay they shortly told me to contact my bank. I did and thankfully, after 10 days the transcation was refunded by my bank.
4. The payment page says that if I pay with crypto, I can save 15% by using the code ""BITCOIN"". I tried both the codes ""CRYPTO"" and ""BITCOIN"" and neither worked. The payment processor Coingate.com didn't ask for any code at any step of the process. Just an hour ago I tried the code again and it definitely doesn't work.
In this case, not the problems, but the supports reaction completely changed my opinion about Liftmode. A customer is a fool: does it matter that our website clearly says it's $100 and even the email we just sent clearly says it's $100, if right above we can say that ""no, it's actually $120 and has always been so?"" The reaction about the card payment problem is equally bad. I sent you my banking statement where you can see that my account is charged, I waited and contacted you again four days later. Couldn't you contact your payment processor and ask to check the transaction? You easily could, I couldn't. Their reply seems to mean ""not our problem"". Indeed, money is on your side, so now it's only the customer's problem how to return it back.
I would not mind seeing some comments from your side."
1259,1,"Worst customer service experience. Went to 255 36th St, South Ogden, UT 84405 to buy SALE items , the Manager/Cashier on duty 11/05/2018 around 8pm said"" We only allow 6 Sale items"".I asked why my friend who went here yesterday never had a problem? The store policy been changed for just overnight?. She said "" No that's store policy ever since. Never been changed"" Really? I've been customer for Walgreens over 4 years and never had problems checking out. And she answered, ""I've been working here over 7 years and that's the policy""...""What you gonna do with all of these stuffs anyway?"" What in the world you going to ask that to customers? I have my purchased history and... before I finish she interrupts me and said ""nope we can't do it"" I said if we are going to eat it, donate or throw it afterwards is NONE of your BUSINESS!!! And she said "" Enjoy eating"". I will go back to the store to get her name and with my printed purchases."
1260,2,"My daughter and I decided to go to Walgreens yesterday immediately upon walking in the door, the clerk stopped waiting on another customer and yelled over to us that my daughter needed to hand over her purse to the clerk (which was a small backpack). The customer she was waiting on looked at us....and I felt completely embarrassed and confused. I asked why and the clerk cited it was store policy. Despite the numerous times I have been in that store and an associate magically appears in the same aisle as I have... I continued to return and have spent a lot of money in this store..However, yesterday, for me was the last straw...I have allowed their employees to stalk me when I make a candy run over and over again...but randomly asking for my daughter's purse when she walked in the store with me was the final act. I will never return to Walgreens again."
1261,1,"First time encounter with Phytoextractum. I paid by e-check, and about a week later I had $2,000 stolen from my bank account with a fake check. Since I rarely use checks and have never done e-checks prior to this, I am very certain that data breach happened when I put my info in through their site.
Not enough info yet to review their product, but my recommendation is to NOT purchase through their website. If you live nearby and can pay in cash, great. But any personal info you put through their website might as well be posted to all on social media. Be warned."
1262,3,"I ordered the white maeng da. The product I received does not look like, smell like, or have the same density as true white maeng da. It has an unfamiliar scent- an additive. I believe you sell a kratom blend/tea, but on your website you advertise your products as ""kratom""."
1263,3,"I, too, was a longtime customer of Phytoextractum and spent thousands over several years. Then I receive an order in which the little glass vial of FST had shattered during transit. This is a $55 product. I politely sent Phytoextractum a message which was ignored, so I sent another message. Now it's another business day and no replacement was sent, no response to my messages. I've ordered this product a million times and they have always used a padded envelope. This time they didn't, and my order was subsequently ruined. I am appalled that they would treat a loyal customer in such a manner. I'm starting to think these reviews are from Phytoextractum themselves, as a simple Google search will show you they have an F on the BBB. I will gladly retract this review if they make it right, which I sincerely hope they do."
1264,2,"Ordered four bottles of a pricey supplement. Delivery service lied and said it was delivered to my main lobby of my apartment complex. I have no main lobby! There is a rental office here that closes at 5pm and they do not accept deliveries for residents. The delivery was supposedly delivered at 8pm! Pretty interesting considering they don't accept packages and it was three hours after they close.
Dealing with customer service is like pulling teeth. Hours after I contact them about the issue, they send me an email asking for my shipping address to double check. It's on the order receipt you idiots! They are clearly wasting time until they go home, this could have already been resolved by a competent person.
I should have come here before I placed my order. I will never order from them again, this has been a terrible waste of time. From now on I'm sticking to Amazon."
1265,3,"I've ordered from Vitacost every once in a while across the span of the past 2 years and often there were items that arrived damaged. The company advertises a flexible return policy and so I contacted their customer support each time there were damaged products. Their support staff treated me like a swindler.
They didn't improve the manner in which they package items at the warehouse, because damaged product deliveries continued after I raised my concerns.
They maintained their flexible return policy in this time, yet I was treated like a second-rate shopper.
Aim to deliver intact items or stop antagonizing customers who expect you will follow through."
1266,3,"Now not so much. Products not listed as being out of stock and are, then items are shipped slow boat (even though you had ""free two day shipping"" you receive item 6 days later. You spend the required amount for two day shipping and receive an email on due date saying its late but tracking number doesnt work so no idea when it will arrive. This is the new norm. Again corporate profitability trumps all else including customer satisfaction. This is also dishonest practice to get customers to spend more to get two day shipping and then dont deliver. Vitacost email doesnt work, either does chat. Guess that way they dont have to hear the complaints."
1267,1,"People have taken this and they became even more sick. Further more, JillyJuice claims are not backed with proper evidence. Sources of so-called ""evidence"" she is attaining is not reliable as it is online.
She also has no medical degree or any certification whatsoever to have the right to make this claims. All claims she makes are based completely on theory and supernatural content. There is also a high sodium content that is risky for many people. Basically, this is promoting a product that isn't even confirmed whether it works or not. I recommend not trying it at all."
1268,1,"This woman is legitimately killing vulerable people for their cash. Please, PLEASE, if you are someone who takes Jilly Juice, or someone thinking of it, don't. There is plenty of evidence out there to tell us how dangerous and stupid it is to do.
However I know that people in a desperate situation are willing to do anything, even to the point that it kills them. So instead I'll ask, what are her qualifications? Seriously? She had a ""revelation"" one day about the chemical makeup of the human body (which she got wrong btw) and decided the way to fix everything is to scarf salt in fermented cabbage water.
She has no medical training, zilch. She worked for a little bit as a marketing consultant, that's it. And so if was to say anyone who could engineer a business cult, and then accidentally fall for her own ideas, I'd say it'd be her.
It's ok to be sick and scared and worried, it's not ok to listen to a madwomans word as gospel, and then kill yourself."
1269,1,"The bottom line is, the only thing Jilly Juice cures is constipation, and only temporarily. It's basically a exceedingly high sodium fetid cabbage laxative slurry, with which miracles are supposedly performed through long bouts of explosive diarrhea. If that isn't horrible enough, Epperly's apparent delusions of grandeur and paranoia have taken her down a twisted road of other fantastical, but of course unproven, beliefs. There's much blather about ""the Matrix"", parasites, yeast, living forever, exercise is bad, sex is bad, media is bad, and on and on."
1270,1,"I've only been taking Thrive for a little over a week, so I can't really speak on the actual products yet. I can say that I don't feel any different so far. My issue with this company is that ALL they care about is getting more people under you, even if you aren't a promoter. And when I asked to switch my sponsor to someone I actually knew because I didn't like a stranger hounding me for more customers and not caring if I even had the right products for me, I was told this wasn't allowed. Then I was told I'd have to cancel my account and couldn't sign up again for 90 days. This company doesn't seem to understand that without customers, you can't even have promoters. All they care about is getting more people into their pyramid scheme. Worst customer service ever!!!! What a terrible experience, and waste of money."
1271,3,"If you ever want to know what it feels like to overdose on Adderral, or 5 hour energy drinks, this is the closest thing to it. Took the 2 pills in the morning, drank the shake a 1/2 hour later and put the patch on. Had to take the patch off an hour later. Spent the last 8 hours puking, there is so much caffeine or something in this stuff. Jaw is clenched, horrible taste in my mouth, physically unable to eat or drink anything without yacking. I am going to be up all night. My eyes feel like they are propped open with toothpicks."
1272,1,"I have eczema and found out before I took this product that it contains shellfish (which I'm extremely allergic to) I asked if this would affect me at all and I was told no. So I went ahead and starting using this product for a month. I have broken out beyond belief, the patches irritated my skin sobad it left them raw. No energy no weight loss, this product is bs! I contacted support to get my money back and they just give me the run around. This is such a waste of money! And I will let everyone know."
1273,3,"I ordered for my first time and received items that were wet with torn packaging and some of the items were missing. I'm slightly bemused and confused as to either give them applause for having one product being completely intact without being damaged and or wet ... or to be displeased about having to still go out to buy what I intended to buy online from an actual drug store now. The point was to was to create customer convenience which should be the factor that generates your revenue.... I am left wondering how an order that says fully shipped and delivered didn't fully get to my door. And do I even bother asking for money back or will they return me a half torn bill?... This is just purely awkwardly bewildering. I leave you a flabbergasted emoticon :o
It's a shame because I really liked a lot of the brands they held. I would have be an ongoing client. It makes me wonder why those brands would affiliate with this kind of service that doesn't even get to the product to the paying customers hands. Is that truly the message you want to send and affiliate yourself with? If a client is dissatisfied with the service, it has a certain negative impact in the underlying purchasing experience in relation to your brand. You know that right?"
1274,2,"I have been ordering from Well.ca for YEARS and while they are expensive, they do offer free shipping for $35 orders which is very reasonable. And the couple of times there was a problem with my order the customer service was extremely professional and either immediately shipped a replacement or refunded my money. It was AMAZING! But lately I don't know what changed because now orders take FOREVER to ship - usually more than their stated 1 - 3 business days and products arrive damaged, missing, cans badly dented, etc. And they switched from Canada Post to FedEx which is a nightmare because FedEX (and UPS) have a habit of NOT delivering a package but putting on their website that a delivery attempt was made but nobody was home, when that's a lie. Google this and you'll see that this has been a problem for many people for YEARS. When they shipped with CanadaPost, my order arrived quickly, right to my door, no fake delivery attempts, and in excellent condition whereas the courier delivery person often slams the box down on the ground ignoring big ""FRAGILE"" stickers.
Anyway, I will no longer be giving my business to Well.ca because they're too slow now and shipping via a courier that lies about attempted delivery defeats the purpose of ordering products online to be delivered to my home. If I have to go pick it up at some drop-off location because the courier was too lazy to do his or her job, I might as well go to a store myself in the first place. If I order something online I want it delivered to my door FAST. By fast, it should arrive within 3 days. Instead, you're lucky if Well.ca even ships the order in 3 days. Often it takes longer."
1275,1,"Worst customer service ever!!
My order returned without notifying me so I contacted with customer sevice and they offered me full refund which I didnt ask for, and resending. And when I asked for the update later they said we gave you full refund and just wait. I waited 2 months without any update and when I asked last time theysaid it has damaged so forget it with $10 coupon. They couved informed me before but never did and I complained about that and tell them to send the package but no anwsers until now 6 days passed from the email I sent."
1276,3,"Placed my order at 11:00am then received an email at 2:10pm saying the order was cancelled at my request and my payment was refunded. Since I didn't cancel, I sent them an email asking what happened. They responded that they had found a SKU error that resulted in a pricing error and encouraged me to order again, At that point I called my bank's credit card fraud # to let them know about the suspicious circumstances and they assured me they had not seen any refund notification or any other info from the company and let me start a fraud complaint. I sent the company an email letting them know about my fraud action and demanded they immediately send a cancellation of the charge to my bank. The company responded that the cancellation request was sent but that banks take days to process the requests. The charge was cancelled the next day! After seeing your other reviews about some of the manipulative practices of this company i'm certain my getting the charge cancelled was due to my quick and aggressive action. Thank you for asking me to provide feedback on this company."
1277,1,"I had been searching for a 4 pound can of a particular brand of protein powder and Dietary Depot's site said they had 2 cans left so i ordered them. The price was about right (i have been ordering this for years) so I did not bother to scrutinize the order other than the price (my bad). Turns out they sent a 2 pound cans for the price of the 4 and said that's their price. Frankly, that is a bate and switch tactic and they are not the kind of company I wish to do business with again. They may have made a sale for double the price once but that's the last time I will ever order anything from this dishonest company! Be forewarned."
1278,3,"The Crystal deodorant towelettes are hard to find, so after searching on many sites I see they are available at Dietary Depot so I placed an order on 10/20/2018. On 10/22/2018 the order is cancelled and refunded. I receive what appears to be an automated email stating it was cancelled at my request. Why would I cancel something that I've been searching for and need. I emailed them to ask why and received no response. I've called 3 times and only get voice mail. I do another search this evening and Dietary Depot pops up selling the towelettes. I go to place an order then realize they're the same website that cancelled my order last month. Well are they or aren't they available? I have no clue. I'm not a retailer so if there's a limit then they should communicate with you. I have always purchased them in large quantities. I'm a customer and have been using this wipes daily for years. I was thankful to find them instock only to have them cancel with no reason. And more disappointment seeing them on the website as I stock today. I posted a pick of the email I received notifying me that I cancelled, when it was clear that they did. I also attached a pick of the website showing they are in stock today, November 12, 2918."
1279,1,"I purchased this with the promise that I could receive my money back if I was not satisfied and if I had questions I could email or message them. No one ever responded to anything. I have certain diet restrictions and I was hoping for some clarifications on a few parts of the plan and NEVER A RESPONSE. I became frustrated and requested a refund several different ways including PayPal, Brian's emails, and ClickBank and yet NOTHING! This is a scam."
1280,3,I purchased this program yesterday and the download was never made available to me! I have contacted them multiple times with no response. I did get a careless response they the FB PAGE My Wellness My Life. They didn't care that I didn't get my download and said Good Luck! I had to close my bank account too!!
1281,1,"I just wanted to buy the eBook with the diet instructions and suddenly I was charged extra money for additional books I did not choose to buy.
I did not start the diet - I will start soon - and I really hope at least the diet will work because I SPENT MUCH MORE THAN WAS SUPOSED!
DONT BUY THE EBOOK- YOU WILL BE CHARGED MORE THAN YOU THINK!"
1282,1,"I tried Weight Watchers because of all the good reviews around 2015 but found it just to be another diet program. My orientation was given by someone who spent more time on the phone asking the app help desk why my number count was off. 10 minutes explaining the into package. 0 minutes explaining the point system. Orientation was supose to be an hour but we spent 40 minutes on the phone with the help desk, 10-15 minutes giving me the required materials and she ended up closing shop 15 mintues early. So I had a pathetic orientation. I basically was handed items and barely explained the program.
I tried a few sessions and found them to be pep talk groups to cheer you on for little ""wins"". I didn't learn much from them and found I knew even less about the program. I stayed for another orientation explanation but found it to be about as helpful as the first. I think I gave this program 2.5 months and decided not to continue.
The app it self is confusing. You still need to pay for a monthly fee even though you're a Weight Watchers member attending meetings. The app is geared towards their product, does not clearly state proportion servings and really only good if you use their Weight Watchers products. Otherwise you're better off using a calorie counter app.
I occasionally have blood sugar drops. I found the app does not calculate for health issues. Each time I had a one of these I ended up eating a mini meal and the app would calculate for that. By the end of the week I had zero points left for food because of the extra food my body needed to survive. I tried to supplement these variances with the zero point foods but found my body quickly gained weight. I gained a lot of weight trying to use this program. I spent the next two years properly dieting and teaching my self to stop eating when full. Teaching your self to stop eating when full is really the only diet coach you need.
I did not find Weight Watchers to be all that helpful. I ended up gaining little knowledge about the program and ended up gaining a bunch of weight. I spent the next two years teaching my self to eat right and to stop eating when full. No I would not recommend Weight Watchers. It is not for everyone. Their diet sure didn't work for me."
1283,3,I ordered Red Tea Detox in July. Upon opening it I found it was not what I had expected and immediately asked for a refund. That was in July. It is now September and they have yet to refund my money or give me an answer as to if or when they will process my request. Customer service does not exist.
1284,1,"I went to their web page and chose the plan that says $3.07 per week which is the simplest and cheapest one. If you do the math, 3.07 x 52 weeks in a year is $159.64. You divide that by 12 months and your monthly bill should be $13.30. Right? Sorry, WRONG. They charged me $16.21 per month. I called them and the lady told me that the small letters supposedly said something different. So with Weight Watchers you don't sign for what you see in big colorful pricing information, you actually commit to pay something completely different that is probably explained in very small letters in a place that as a customer you don't have access to anymore.
I requested to cancel the account and the lady had the nerve to even try to force me to take 1 month free instead, and since I said no then he kept insisting with two and three months free. So they lied to you, they take away your money and then they try to make you stay.
What a company. Stay away."
1285,1,"I signed up to weight watchers and paid upfront for 3 months, however I didn't really use it properly and was going to sign up again when I could afford it and give it another go. This month I logged into my bank to find that WW had taken £12.95 from my account and because of that I went into my overdraft and was charged by my bank. Furious I went onto the WW site to see in SMALL print that you will continue to be charged until you inform them of your cancellation. I am fed up of companies locking people in to contracts, it's not the way to do business! I emailed them asking for my money back and my bank charge to which they refused saying that it was in their terms and conditions. They only care about money, I mean what is £12.95 to them anyway, stupid as it's cost them a customer - how narrow minded!
They need to take a leaf out of Amazon's book who refund their loyal customers no questions asked. Keep your money and go and buy some diet/ exercise books where you won't have money automatically taken from your bank acccount!!!!!"
1286,3,"Very interesting especially about the eating within 30 minutes after you wake up. Didn't realize it was a lot about buying the vitamin packs. I wanted to quit before I went, had high hopes but wanted a cigarette as soon as I got to my car. Had a few puffs at work that night. Don't think it worked for me. No nasty bugs came to mind when I had a few puffs."
1287,1,"Of course Mark Patrick doesn't actually host the seminars, at least not mine. Mine was hosted by someone named Pat, I believe, and this was on January 27, 2019 at 2PM in Beachwood. I have given this review to the company directly. They responded telling me they were trying to reach the many and why they cover ""nutrients"" the email from them doesn't mention the vitamins they're selling. I was not offered a refund for anything. It was clear they only want compliments. This is a total scam.
The majority of the 2 hours was used as a sales pitch to buy vitamins he only had ""a few"" left of. The sales pitch lasted 45 minutes. The actual ""hypnosis"" was not hypnosis. It was a relaxation exercise where he told us smoking is bad for us, pronounced ""painful"" in an odd way, and put in some brief aversion therapy by telling us to imagine licking an ashtray if we ever smoked again. The ""hypnosis"" lasted, he claimed 29 minutes, my phone said it was 35 minutes. He asked leading questions to get the attendees to agree they were ""hypnotized"" for only 10 minutes or so as ""proof"" they were hypnotized.
We also had a 15 minute break to smoke and to buy vitamins. And the seminar started at 2:15 to give the people that were late a chance to get there (no one got there after 1:50). Also, Pat is a fast talking man from NJ, he barely slowed down during the ""hypnosis"" and we weren't allowed to ask questions because he's answer them eventually.
It's a scam. I'll report this everywhere I can."
1288,1,Hypno man is entertainment. It is all about vitamin sales. The sales people give out medical advice like they are your physician. They tell people including me their food vitamins are safe for everyone. If you are on certain meds like channel blockers you know what your doctor has told you yet I was screamed at for not purchasing vitamins. Nope....I followed a real doctors orders...AVOID AND BEWARE.
1289,3,"I've just spent hours of my life researching this product. It has too many red flags:
1- why are most of the reviews on here submitted on the same day? And of course they are all five stars and of similar length, etc.
2- its a digital product, but you have to provide a shipping address even if you want to check out through paypal.
3- the 2 youtube review videos could easily be affiliated with the company. How would one random customer have a special link for a $20 discount?
4- her story in the hour and a half long video is really far-fetched about her being bit by a snake and falling in quicksand to get this recipe from an ancient African shaman. Plus, why keep selling your product for a solid hour and a half. It said at the beginning she would give you the recipe at the end of the video. Of course that was a lie. Even during the video there is a countdown on the screen to when you get the recipe and it counts down to zero, disappears, and she keeps talking and never gives you the ingredients.
5- her story also says she tried everything else to loose weight including eating less and exercising alot. However, the video also said she had a soda addiction and a sweet tooth. Seems like there might have been more options left before risking your life in Africa.
6- this whole thing is very convincing. I wanted to believe it, but there are just too many scam signals. They did a good job trying to rig the internet."
1290,1,"Why would the author think that you want or need to read 80 pages about your digestive system and how it operates and still cannot locate the recipe. She sends you a ton of e-mails to ""enhance"" your detox experience and everything she sends has a price tag........I sent her a response and told her she is a SCAM Artist. There is no ""quick"" fix ~ you have to take your time and loose the weight.. It didn't happen overnight and it will not go away overnight..."
1291,1,"Hi all, please don't buy this product it's totally waste of money. I bought it through offer buy 3 bottles get 3 bottles, I paid 6000/-totally waste .

I am expecting reply...."
1294,2,"I should have kept track of all the misinformation I have found on the website articles. I found that sometimes they tend to be drawing their own conclusions while citing the researches that are not directly related to their statements. Confirmation bias much?
And on other parts where no researches are cited, information are written based on ""common sense"" or ""bro science"". Too much myths and confusions.
Please do not simply assume everything. Some information can be dangerous to reader's health."
1295,3,"I don't know what happened - did livestrong hire a different company for their tracking user interface. It used to be good; with the June 2017 ""upgrade"" it lost functionality to the point that I am abandoning the tool. You used to be able to chart your measurements (waist, hips, etc.). Now you can only see a week's worth of data.
You used to be able to access your data's history: no more.
And to add insult to injury, when I wrote tech support it took 10 BACK AND FORTH MESSAGES before the guy answered my original question - and the answer was 'no, you can't do that any longer.' Good-bye Livestrong! If you hire back your old development team/company, let me know."
1296,3,"So there is a long running myth about ""complete proteins"" that need to be involved in vegetarian diets. They myth states that the proteins in plants do not have all the essential amino acids so the proteins must be paired with certain carbs or something to complete it.
Seeing as plants cannot exist without all the ESSENTIAL amino acids its ridiculous to say that they are missing any. The proteins do not need anything else to be proteins.
I dont know where this myth started but health classes from grammar school to college are teaching and also un-teaching this myth, while livestrong attempts to keep it alive of course."
1297,3,I ordered once with no problem but after the first time I have constantly had issues ordering from the site and have even had to order through someone else. I can never get a holdof a person for help and it's days if ever that someone returns a call. I do however like the product so I keep trying toorder.
1298,3,"I had to try five times to satisfy the computer and get rid of the red banners. It was all trial and error because there was nothing showing the form I was to use for my phone number, it just said it was wrong. I finally figured out that the computer doesn't like parentheses, hyphens, or spaces. Then it still wouldn't let me send the order, but gave me no clues as to the reason. By process of elimination, I finally figured out that the computer can't interpret the word ""Road"", but will only accept ""Rd"". Would it be too difficult to show a prospective customer the exact forms the answers must take to be understood by your stupid computer? Then, I was told I would receive a cup and something else, neither of which were in the shipment. My iPad never did show that the purchase had been completed, the progress bar just stopped about 3/4 of the way across and twisted but never progressed. After an hour I gave up and closed my iPad. I never received confirmation that my purchase had posted successfully, and I decided to wait a few days and try again, or call your company. Then, out of the blue, the shipment arrived, to my very great surprise, but there was no invoice, no proof of purchase, no cup or whatever the other ""free"" bonus gift that was promised, nothing but the two containers of your product. If I didn't like your product, I would never do business with your company again. For the life of me, I can't figure out how you stay in business, assuming my experience is typical for online customers."
1299,3,"EVERYTIME!!! I try to log in to reorder the meal replacement shakes, I either have to change my password or reset my password or sometimes even have to call because I am unable to log in. today it was change the password 2 times and use a different email. It is not on my end as I haveused home and work computer. may start ordering from amazon or trying another product. I really like this one but reorder hassles is almost not worth the product."
1300,1,"I signed up and paid for this program. It was about $457.00. A week later, it is further reduced to under $400. Nutrisystem will not refund the difference. The customer service ( two of them) who handled my request to cancel this product after one shipment were rude, unprofessional and determined to charge me the $125. Nor did they try and offered me other potential solutions.This was even after I explained there appeared to be mouse droppings in the dry box full of food that they delivered to me. To me they were Clearly unsympathetic and lacked empathy to my concern and issues. They didn't even discuss that they would look into my issues and get back to me.
However, they were sure to tell me that I would have to pay the $125. They did this by way of charging my original credit card information from my first order when I signed up two weeks ago. In other words, they kept my credit card information and then, as soon as I got off the phone with them, they immediately charged my credit card account $125 even after all of the issues I raised and, stating I did not want to pay this cancellation charge of $125. (They probably charged my card while we on the phone. That's what the credit card statement showed.) This was after I stated I do not want to pay that, the box and possible mice droppings, the expense overall.
The lack of sensitivity to the customer was frustrating, maddening and really, incredible in this day and age of full refunds or partial refunds and maybe even a ""Sorry"" it didn't work out with most on line companies.
Stay tune.....I'm going to attempt to return the box and see if they will honor their ""guarantee or your money back.....just return the unused food""
Go with someone else if you have the time to research weight loss products and services."
1301,2,"Food is tasteless, made me sicker than a dog! I didn't lose any weight at all! I had migraines every day due to not being able to eat enough. They don't tell you to add any fresh food items like veggies. But customer support told me via social media. Are you serious? It's not enough food for an average person even! Waste of my money!"
1302,1,"Turbo 10 purchased for $250. Bought the Basic Plan. Food not much to talk about. (I could do better in taste and value with Lean cuisine @ the Grocery Store). So one month was all I wanted. But, I found out that I was locked into 2 months ( or a $99 cancelation fee) by some very fine print carefully hidden on the order page. Customer Service would do NOTHING about it (except offer to show me where it was on their Website (What does THAT tell you!) BUYER BEWARE. Before you throw away your money.its in (very) fine print under SUBMIT ORDER. I would like to know why a company cant be held to honest advertising all it would take is: TURBO 102 month minimum order required What about it Nutrisystem. afraid youll lose some customers? I hope this review accomplishes the same. After all, it cost me $ 350. (Anyone looking for some boxed food cheap?)"
1303,3,"I have done business with Herbalife for many years. Their customer service has gone extremely bad in the last year. My credit card company kept obstructing my order so I tried to change the card in the Herbalife's system but it did not work on the recording. I was told that it could not be altered. The order was rejected five more times. Herbalife did not even inform me on the matter. I finally got them to change it but the next month they used my old card and the result was it was blocked again. You would think I could get help. I waited 30 minutes for a supervisor who then changed the card but I was told my order would take a while to get. They refused to send it out faster, even though it was their fault. I am considering changing to another company."
1304,3,"You might see your friends offering you the opportunity to sell some health and fitness products, but look a little further and it starts to look more like a pyramid sales system than actually caring about people's health and fitness. Didn't like the gimmicks of sales techniques, some products weren't available for vegetarians or vegans and most people could stay fit and healthy just by doing regular exercise and eating healthier, therefore Herbalife sales techniques become redundant and a chain of sales people aren't really required for a proactive healthy life."
1305,3,"Decent, but HUGELY overpriced products, which is typical of Multi Level Marketing companies. Herbalife is one of the worst when it comes to requiring their reps to front load products and put out tons of money every month to keep their ""volume"" up.
Very sad reality for the reps. Now that the FTC has nailed Herbalife with a$200 million fine and forcing them to completely change their compensation plan, Herbalife will soon be out of business in the USA.
It's great the see the FTC finally start to product the consumer by targeting MLM companies."
1306,1,"On May 3rd ,(2019) at 9:44am (EST), I called Vitaglo to find out about the status of my April 17 shampoo order (order # vitaglo-97508).
I was calling, because I had gotten no response to the email I sent Vitaglo on May 2, 2019 (10:44am EST) and the goods should have arrived already.
I tried to mention that I had emailed, and gotten no response, from Vitaglo. The customer service representative cut me off, and said ""Just give me the zip code"".
When I told him the zip code, he echoed back a different 5-digit number than what I was saying. 
*** I told him my zip code 3 times, and each time he echoed a different number. ***
Each time I repeated my zip code, I enunciated more carefully, and I spoke louder.
He became offended (and reacted in an EXTREMELY RUDE manner), because I was speaking more loudly.
He told me to use the email address. (As I said, I had tried to tell him earlier that I got no response from my earlier email but he cut me off, before I got a chance to say it.)
I called the number back, hoping to get a customer service representative without a NASTY ATTITUDE.
The same guy answered, still RUDE AND NASTY.
He finally got my zip code, and told me the shampoo is on back order. He said he'd credit my Paypal account.
To Vitaglo: You need to consider hiring customer service personnel with some basic understanding of how to deal with the public."
1307,1,"ORDERED A PRODUCT ON FEB 3. THREE WEEKS LATER, NO PRODUCT. CALLED VITAGLO & WAS TOLD I'LL GET A CALLBACK. NO ONE CALLED BACK. CALLED THEM BACK IN A WEEK. WAS TOLD MY ITEM WAS OUT OF STOCK. IF I HAD NOT OF CALLED THEM, I WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN THAT MY ITEM WAS OUT OF STOCK.WAS TOLD THAT MY DEBIT CARD WOULD BE REFUNDED. I ASKED WILL IT BE REFUNDED TODAY AND THEY SAID YES. CARD WAS NEVER REFUNDED. A WEEK LATER I REPORTED THEM TO THE B.B.B. AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. 2 AND A HALF WEEKS AFTER REPORTING THEM TO THE 2 AGENCY'S, I GOT A FULL REFUND. SO TWO MONTHS AFTER ORDERING AND GETTING NO PRODUCT, I FINALLY GOT A REFUND. THESE PEOPLE ARE SCOUNDRELS AND CROOKS AS I AM SURE IF I HAD NOT OF GOTTEN THE 2 AGENCY'S INVOLVED, THEY WOULD HAVE KEPT MY MONEY AND GIVEN ME NOTHING. MY ADVICE.....DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THEM."
1308,3,"Ordered Agave that totaled $175. 10 days later I reached out asking where my product was. They told me that I had to pay $20 shipping. When it clicked, and I asked, ""Wait, you haven't even shipped it?"" , they lost their minds. Ended up refusing to talk on the phone, only email. When I told them this was terrible customer service, she replied "" there is no customer service"".
A week later, I found an email in my spam folder, telling me it was going to cost them $59 to ship my product, and that they would split the shipping with me. This was sent to me a day or so after I placed my order, but I never saw it. So instead of them calling me, and explaining, they apparently intended on keeping my money, and just seeing if I ever reached out.
Hands down, worst customer service I have seen in 20 years. They jumped to the defense so quickly, and seemed so agitated, as if they were the ones not receiving something they had ordered, that it leads me to believe that this is an ongoing problem.
Domestic orders over $100 receive free shipping. False. You guys need to up your game, because my review will simply get lost in the long line of disappointed customers."

They said it was in route but wouldn't give me a tracking number. Very rude on the phone! After that phone call....two days later, I was charged another $93.95. I called and complained. They said they would give me the money back right away.....never got the money back or the product. I called them and cancelled the order. The next month, I was charged again! So I ended up having to close my bank account and file a dispute. The bank was very understanding and gave me the money back and said they would go after the company. You can risk it if you want....but I don't think ANYTHING is worth that hassle! :("

After a 20min. run around on the phone I was told that the computer system was down and they would cancel the product after system was restored. I asked about the $83.95 that they took out of my account and was told he couldn't do anything about it. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told that all the managers in the building were in a meeting and that someone would call me back, which never happened. Now I have two unopened bottles of Colon Cleanse 3000 and wouldn't you know I received a third bottle and my account was debited another $83.95 for the third bottle.

I tried to cancel and was told they do NOT offer a money back refund!!! 14 days after you place your order you will be charged again! Even if the order is processing...you cannot refuse shippment and get a refund! NO MONEY REFUNDS! I personally have been charged TWICE and still NO PRODUCTS!!!

Being in charge of a company where taking care of customer personal data with the utmost confidence and respect is simply given, this was a shocker for me."
1316,3,"Dwayne, Spencer, Divine Reedings a Very good selection, Nice easy to understand platform, But I tried several times to contact customer service and they never answered. Not very professional, Great readers but customer service is lacking. Lucky for me I have found some of the same great psychics at other sites."
1317,1,"Very cold reading. Seemed to only agree with what i was asking. Gave no details about my situation or offered any advice. When i asked her which one of the jobs that i applied for,would i get she said""What jobs did you apply for?"" Seems she would of had some idea of at least what ""field"". Not only that the connection on the phone was choppy and staticky. Told me well that will happen even if you choose another reader. No offered solution. She also from what i could hear contradicted herself several times. Good thing it was only 19 cents a minute ($1.90) total or i would have been furious. Stay away."
1318,3,"Think about it......all of these bad reviews are not found on the Asknow website. Everyone has a good review so basically all the psychics on the website are great..........YEAH RIGHT. Then it hit me ....I rated a psychic twice for two readings at a poor rating but when I was went to my reading details on the website, it says I gave the psychic 5 stars and I know I absolutely did not"
1319,1,she was too slow. wasted time making me wait for more than 3 minutes. asked me for names and DOBs multiple times. And after all that her English was bad and her typing was too slow with mistakes... She cant call herself as an expert... Liveperson.com..... Do you evaluate these people before they come on board as experts ???? Your quality sucks....
1320,1,"So I just had a reading from QUASHA. She was soooo inaccurate. Said things pertaining to my sex life that were just not true. Stated ridiculous prediction that were just not true. I also want to say that all three psychics told me something different. When I called and asked for my money back, they said no. I said well then let me leave a fair review. As you notice, no bad reviews are posted and there are many gaps in between the reviews. Some people are more easily brain washed than others. I also had a reading from JOHN who charges 13 a minute. He should be in VEGAS if he claims to be that amazing. He asked me so many questions and then just gave me also a prediction that was off the wall. I asked for clarity and reassurance. they will not give it to you. You can not leave your review. When I asked this, he asked me to go back again and look up a date that was 2 stars. Well it still appeared as 5 stars and claimed that I had vision problems. i turned up the brightness on my screen and nothing. THESE PEOPLE ARE LYING TO YOU AND IS A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!"
1321,1,"I have used their shady services three times and when I asked for a refund for a session I have not used, they threatened to sue me, report me to the FBI and yes I got banned from their site.
Shame on you John and Rosalyn.
Shame on you ERIC and KILEEN.
And one more thing, they will use any recordings you paid for against you if you decide to dispute any charge due to poor service."
1322,1,I was trying to delete my account so chatted with customer support member and they talked to me for a bit then just stopped talking to me. All i wanted was to delete my account. On the website they have no where to delete your account. Im not impressed. Got bad service. Also all i wanted was my account delete so they blocked my IP address there was no need for that. NOT GOING ON THAT SITE AGAIN...SCAM FOR SURE.
1323,3,"Not exactly what I was looking for.Seems to be too complcated and too much of an effort.It would be easier just to use someone else.maybe in a few months they can improve their service and update their site.They seem to be behind the times. Not quite the Dream Maker I was hoping to find. Authentic psychic Sox were good and so was Barracuda and realist but I would rather talk to them at another site.
I have also noticed when a psychic is tested that some are not asked the hard questions that others are asked. In other words the questions can depend on the person's mood when screening a psychic. A credible test should take time and should have the same basic questions for everyone.Sorta like a true ESP examination.A person should be qualified to test and screen a psychic reader and the questions asked should apply to everyone.I do find this to be true with most sites.Many screen their psychics but there decisions can be based on how well they like a person or if they think they can make money off of a person..It should be done by a professional who has the ability to make a true ESP examination."
1324,3,I've been reading on keen for a little over a year. There are some good psychics but nothing they say comes true. But I gave my honest opinion on two psychics. Lady prophet and Citrine Angel both gave me a reading when I went back to them things change it was totally different than the last reading. Citrine Angel's reading change in a matter of 9 days . Lady prophets was different in 6 months because she gave me a 6 months time frame and then she tried to use free will. I dont believe In free will. That's something psychics try to use because their predictions was wrong. But anyways I wrote a honest review and keen has removed it from there website so I believe keen reviews are fabricated because when I Wright a good review it's still on the site but when I give a psychic the 1 star review they deserve it magically erases. So as a paying customer we should be able to have honest reviews to go on and keen doesn't allow that like top sites like psychic source which I'm going back to cause prediction from my favorite psychics Craig and athena has happened. Left because too costly but in spending the same amount of money on keen for less quality psychics.
1325,3,"Not a single prediction has come to pass. I tried to cancel my account and get the remaining money refunded to me, but Keen refused...so I decided to use my remaining amount. I called a lady with 4.9 stars. I actually inquired about my book. She said, ""I get chills. You will do great. "" I asked her elaborate and she said. ""I see you getting published. Don't worry, you will not have to self publish."" Guess what? I have been self published for a while now and will not be going through a conventional publisher. I then inquired about work and she kept demanding and insisting to know my precise age -- and birth date, I guess in order to look me up from a communal Keen board and give me a fake reading. ""Tell me your actual, precise age so can draw some cards."" I am not giving this information to a stranger nor does she need that to do a reading. Knowing that what she had said so far was false --I just hung up...Remarkably, Keen would not even let me leave feedback. How much money do you have to spend on these fakes to be able to leave feedback. She had nearly 5 stars and yet everything she told me was wrong. How is this possible? I am not difficult to read?"
1326,1,"I have contacted Keen for years....nothing absolutely nothing that ant adviser has told me on this has come true. This a Fraud, one adviser tells you one thing about the same situation and then another tells you the absolute opposite. Keen Psychics is an absolute WASTE OF MONEY!!! I am definitely no longer putting any of my financial resources towards their phony psychics!!! I have spoke to more then 100 of them all FRAUD!!!!!"
1327,3,"In Feb 22 I responded to an Email from Tara Medium. I throughly read the complete summary where she predicted a ""lucky day in Feb 28th. The summary went on to explain what ""I needed to do for ""her"" to dispel the evilness which was following me; causing mayhem & was keeping ""good luck"" from being fire front in my life. It also stated Tara needed to perform a special ritual for me to protect me which would cost me $29.00. I was given the option to make a one time option to pay the fee OR pay in 3 payments. I chose the 3 payment option. Upon receiving my bank statement my CC was charged twice, $9.99 both times on Feb 21, 2019 @ 5:41. I DID NOT AGREE to this. I have since UNFRIENDED Tara. I have contacted by banking institution AND I want a full refund of $20."
1328,1,I have been asking for my refund back. Sending Tara email back to back but I still didn't here anything. I really need my refund before I take it all over social media. To let the whole world know about Tara's scam and fraud services. I have been asking for my refund till now it not completed yet since 2018 and now March of 2019.
1329,3,"she told me how to write for a refund, what info to include, what site to submit the mail from. isi could. she never sent it. she still writes the same silly stuff. she keeps telling me about i am about to win the lottery, if i pay her big bucks to eradicate bad luck first. her predictions show noknowledge of me. she sends lists of numbers that will bring me luck. these are just numbers our of her head. the amount of money she asks for keeps increasing. there are real psychics in this world. she isn't one of them. tara, i want my money back. it is october 30. i have been patient with you."
1330,3,"I have also been intrigued by this Jenna lady. Kept receiving emails from her about this stupid transit period. I eventually followed her link to my own ""personalized"" page and then followed another link that took me to a nice little form to fill out requesting money in order to get a more in depth reading from her. i then saw that she was online available to chat and she greeted me first. I thanked her for her review but advised that I could not afford her $80 Fee which is more than R800 for me. She then proceeded to tell me that i cannot waste this opportunity and should make a plan to get the money for the reading. I told her i was not prepared to spend that much money on something that has a good chance of not even being true.
She then nicely disappeared...."
1331,1,"I put no stars! This is a fraudulent person taking advantage. I was duped. I didn't check it out first because a friend referred me (and she hadn't done her chart yet). Jenna wis not genuine. It's all boiler plate bull hockey! She will insist on keeping your money, after you discover the fraud when youreceive the 'reading.' I have taken up the matter with my credit card company (quality concern). This is a shameful scam. Be Forewarned!"
1332,1,"There showed up on my computer a letter from an Astrolgist- lady called Jenna telling a lot of things- finally she directs you to a personal website set up for your case and where she wants cash to be transferred from your bank account. Looking on Google I found out that Jenna is also a fraud. She charges 60 to 80 $ for her predictions and people found out that everybody receives the same letters. So take care, log such mails directly as SPAM in gmail and delete them from your computer. One should have the power to persecute the servers which distribute this spam and scam and confiscate all equipment by police forces. The Scammers used in this case a site called messaging-master.net to distribute this spam. We need to clean out the Internet from such scammers urgently. If we can catch the Internet servers or close them down because of fraud, scammin and spamming would be great."
1333,3,Many of the best Male psychics are on this page. They are also good about quality and keeping psychics from establishing multiple accounts.. However customers can open multiple accounts just by using a different phone number and email address... They also do not allow self engineered feedback that is so popular on many websites.. However a disgruntled customer can always open another account and leave another bad review on a psychic if they are unhappy with... Sometimes customers will open extra accounts just to take advantage and to get more complimentary free minutes.This company can be trust worthy and you can trust that you don't end up talking to the same psychics under different names..but customers can keep coming back under a different name. Some things are good and some things not so much. They keep changing the rules or they don't apply to everyone.. This being from another country and being fairly new they can have tech issues and payment issues..I hope they make it because they seem to be on the right track... However too many times a person has complained about not being paid. This is not good business sense..Nor is it good judgment..Some countries won't pay you if they think you are not doing a good job or they fire you.This is unlawful in the US.
1334,3,Ive been having technical issues on this site for weeks now...ever since i was falsely accused of having my bank investigate payments to them..ever since...ive had issues almost daily trying to process payments and recieve service. Ive contacted the site and google play multiple times..and im beyond frustrated. Especially since the original accusations were never true and ive spent thousands of dollars here...i dont expect special treatment..but not having to contact support nearly everyday for the same issue would be great. Prior to this issue i would have given higher rating
1335,1,"I have paid R130,00 x 2 on transaction no. 113000000272973971, R163.34 on 1130000000301371828, and R265,00 on transaction number 4666981774. This is a total of R688.34. I have asked for a refund as non of Angela's reading came true as promised and she keep asking for more money for another rituals for me to benefit from the previous one. When Iasked for refund she replied saying I must rethink this as it might be caused by negative energies that surrounds me. All I want is money back as this is a total scam."
1336,3,"I only marked 1 because there is not a zero. I spent only 9.99 for ""Angela guardian angel"" but after that I got 2 or 3 messages asking why I hadn't responded and now they have my bank info. I got a message they said it was a link to the ""work"" she supposedly did for me but the link never worked at all it just kept saying ""missing page"".
Not trustworthy--I'm asking paypal for a refund on this!"
1337,1,"I have sent 2 requests for a refund and to date have not had a reply or my money back. They are very quick to take your money but do not seem so keen on refunding it!
The angelic tarot reading had no 'angel' names on it at all and they were then trying to get you to buy more products. I feel totally ripped off, especially as I have found out they are based in China and the payments are sent to Gibraltar - what's that all about?
It is a total scam and I want my money back asap."
1338,1,"These people swipe your money. Fake advice. Now they record your private calls and use your details to extort even more money from you! I reported this company to the BBB, to the Scam Tracker and IC3.gov. Do not call this company they will steal you blind and then come back and do it again!"
1339,1,"Totally ripoff, don't waste your money, by the time you say Intro your money is gone. Or if these people give you a reading---'oh but it's free will'!!!!, Save your money from BS!
Psychiccenter.com-don't waste your moneynot worth it, click n bait."
1340,1,This site went down hill this year with a new website and new management. They cut you off of readings you have paid for and keep 2-3 dollars each time. RIP OFF!! It used to be good but now it's garbage.
1341,1,"Hi Everyone,I've been contacted by this ""woman"" (could be a man, who knows?) too. She's been incredibly persistent to put it mildly. But as our government scamwatch (Australia) say to look out for scams of this type I thought I'd suss her out....lo and behold all her reviews are negative!
Thanks for your warning everyone."
1342,1,"I, also received an email from Christin stating, ""But all of a sudden, just as I was about to get into the car, I heard a powerful voice from within asking me not to leave!"" Christin don't leave don't get into this car ""...And that's precisely when I understood that you were the one who had sent me this message, _______!""... Don't you think it's very strange coincidence all of us (that she sent the emails to) individually calling out to her and telling her not to go??? .... Now that's a good question for her... Did we speak to her at the same time or did we speak one at a time?
Today, I received an email from her stating her ""Light Pendulum"" moved on it's own accord. Of course, it moved toward the right pointing to my file! .... How many others received this email from her? 1st of all she should not have any file with my name on it because I have not gave her any information or contacted her for any reason!
I honestly hope no one sends her any money for any type of service because they will be wasting their money and their time. I can't help to feel sorry for the ones out there that are struggling with illnesses, depression, etc.. Most of us struggle with money in some way, but some have it harder than others. I wished the BBB or the ICC would shut her down to prevent her from taking money from people.
Please don't send her any money. All of her messages go out the 'exact same' to everyone. You are not special to her in anyway!"
1343,2,"I have sent 4 emails to Christin medium about a refund for £68. She has not contacted me once about the refund, but i did get a email from her asking to do another reading for £39. Before she sent me the reading i already paid for. This is when i decided enough is enough because all it is money all the time. I have emailed her asking for a refund which in her legal terms i have 30 days to get a refund it has only been 3 days when i asked for my refund. It would be nice if they answered emails and tell you what is going on. What a joke time she is reading what people are saying about her. I read on her facebook page that they are other people that tried to contact her and no answer from her. So all she wants is money off you."
1344,2,"I ordered a baby hamper that was only available online and when I received it there was a red stain on the front. I went to return it in the store hoping I could return it and reorder a new one like a simple exchange. The in store customer service lady said she wasn't able to do that but she could give me merchandise credit so I could order the product again. That sounded easy enough so I returned it, got the merchandise credit and went home to order it again online. However, the credit didn't cover shipping so I called their customer service number and explained what happened just asking for free shipping. Why would I have to pay shipping twice when they sent me a bad product? Well the supervisor said the best they could do was give me a discount on the shipping?! That is ridiculous! For something that was their mistake, the least they could do is pay for the shipping! I definitely will not be shopping there anymore!"
1345,1,"On march 22 I purchased two articles and I was waiting for the delivery ,but 15 days after I never received the order and any email from the store . I called an for my surprise the order never was placed and the lady told me that the system had problem.They took my money but never send me nothing.Then I HAVE TO PLCED THE ORDER AGAIN BY PHONE FOR ONE OF THE ARTICLES BUT THE OTHER WAS UNABLEABLE TO BY IT .FOR ALL OF THIS NEVER TRUST IN THIS WEB SITE .BAD COSTUMER SERVICE."
1346,2,"I purchased two items from here for my friends baby shower, I paid extra for express shipping AND for gift wrap and i just got ONE out of two items and it was not gift wrapped and the actual box that the WubbaNub came in is all damaged and cracked open!!!! What a joke! And the infant swing that I paid over $100 for didn't even come yet like it was supposed to with the WubbaNub! I'm beyond annoyed and disgusted with this crappy service I will NEVER be ordering from them again, I'll be taking my business elsewhere who can actually comprehend my wishes."
1347,1,"This is the worst experience I have ever had, shopping online.
I have waited over 3 weeks for a delivery that was scheduled 3 weeks ago. This company has no idea how to treat customers. They have no clue where my purchase is and what is going on.
My advice. NEVER SHOP HERE...."
1348,1,"Very disappointing at your service! You had posted on your site that you had the hot item hatchimals available. I ordered 2 at double the price, you sent me 2 email confirmations saying they would ship Tuesday, November 29,2016 and took the money out of my account! Then, hours later you sent 2 new emails saying that you were sorry but you were canceling my order and could not fulfill it and that you woukd not take any money out! Well you had already did and the customer service was awful!!!!"
1349,1,"Made a purchase on Wednesday. They charged my card. They send me a confirmation of my order. They next say they send a shipment confirmation. Three hours later I check my order history and see the order had been cancelled! No notification, no email, no call. I just happened to check my account.
Missed out on opportunity to purchase the item that day!
FRAUDS!!!!! FRAUDS!!!!! FRAUDS!!!!!! FRAUDS!!!!!!"
1350,2,"So I've never ever wrote a review about something or a company but I am extremely upset and have never had such absurd service from a company. I registered with babies r us and target. Target was great! But babies r us was literally unhealthy for me. I had 2 items I wanted to purchase on my own from my Registry after receiving my completion coupon which was the crib mattress and the bedding set. I received my completion coupon by mail and by email and I log on to purchase my items. As I'm ready to check out my coupon code turns out invalid... so I call costumer service. I had to be on the phone for 2 hours !!!! 2 hours .... with this lady who I believe had no idea on how to help me but I remained patient. She then tells me ""can you hold a second"" and I said ""okay..."" and she hangs up on me. So I'm furious!! She had my email, she had my phone number so I waited a couple of days to see if she would call me back or I would receive my problem fixed by email and nothing. So I call costumer service again... and I ask to speak to a supervisor and the supervisor refuses to take my call. I'm holding for 40 minutes as the employee is trying to help me and transfer the call to ""higher power"" and finally a supervisor decided to take my call. She doesn't take the fact that I had to spend now 2hrs and 40 mins on the phone to get my code as a matter and just moves on to getting my order done. She places the order for me and I'm thinking maybe after she will at least apologize for everything I've had to go trough just to place an order with them. But no... she places my order and then tells me the only available store for the items to be dropped off are in Roseville, and I'm like wait... what?? I thought the items would be delivered to me? She said no ... that the order would be arriving at this store.
At this point I didn't care to go pick it up at a store. Whatever ... I didn't even think to check to see how far away Roseville was. I mean it just had to be the nearest store to me right ? I check to see after I Hangup and Roseville store is 3 hours away from me !!!!!!
I was livid.
I didn't even wanna have to deal with costumer service for another 2 hours plus I really liked the bedding set so I decided I'd just go pick up my order and about a week later I have the time to go and pick up my items, I'm really upset but it's whatever now I'm just going to pick up my items and never do business with them again right? ...
so i get to the store with my barcodes for the items I purchased for pick up and the girl is having a hard time finding them. I show them the email confirming that my items had arrived there and she calls her supervisor. The supervisor then tells me that my order had been canceled.
Im 37 weeks pregnant.. I literally was about to have a melt down. I felt my tummy get so hard and a stabbing pain at how angry I was that I was just about to start crying there but I'm trying to hold myself together and try to explain everything I've gone through and now this. I never got an email or nothing saying my items were cancelled. So they go to the back trying to see if the items I ordered were still available and no one had purchased them after 20 mins ..they find them in the back. So then the supervisor tells me that I had been refunded for the bedding but not the mattress so I would have to repay for it. So I pay .... i get my items and try to move on with my day. I call my mom to vent to her about my experience with babies r us and she said ""please check your account ... make sure they didn't try stealing your money"" so I laughed like that would really just over do things so I go look at my bank account and I had 2 transactions back to back within a minute... one for $120 (the bedding) which I paid at the store right? And then I had a second transaction right after that one for $297 from babiesrus.com.
but why??
I call the store and they tell me i need to contact costumer service (great!) Im on the phone for 30 minutes and the girl tells me that I should of never been charged at the store in the 1st place ...
and she's trying to transfer my call to higher power. I'm on hold for 20 mins and she then tells me that someone will contact me about the issue, she gets my phone number and no one calls me back.
The stress and anger they've caused me is not healthy for me or my baby. This is my first child, I didn't expect to have to go through something like this just to get my babies items together. I wonder what hell im gonna be put through just to get my money back that they stole. Im going to take a few days off from dealing with this terrible company because as I said, I'm 37 weeks pregnant and I'd hate for all this stress to cause me to go into labor early as I started to get pains yesterday."
1351,2,"I purchased two items from this store in the past month. One was an exersaucer which once I opened the box was used and broken, next I traveled to Florida and went to purchase a bumbo seat. I took the only seat that was in a closed box, the rest in the aisle were opened. Once I got home I saw the bottom of the box was scotch taped shut, the seat had markings all over it and literally smelled like crap. This store truely disgusts me that they can tape up boxes and resell used returned items. When it comes to small babies, no parent should ever take a situation like this lightly. I will never shop at this store again. Buybuy baby has never disappointed and I wish there was one closer to where I'm staying currently."
1352,1,"I've tried for 2 weeks now to purchase items from your online site for my new granddaughter, due to arrive in September. After seeing that I could receive an additional 15% off, I applied for the 'R Us' card, and I was approved immediately. I printed out the '15% off' form that has the application key code on it, but when I tried to print off the temporary shopping pass, the page went blank. I tried several more times to place my order. Finally, I just decided to wait until the card came in the mail. So, card received and activated, and when I tried to place my order online just an hour ago, it would not accept the Application Key Code for the 15% off and gives me an error. This is THE MOST un-friendly website I have ever dealt with and I am extremely unhappy with this service. I have already missed the baby shower (it was on 8/5). My only alternative is to go direct to the store to make my purchases, and all I have to say is they had better accept the 15% credit coupon, and I had better receive the online pricing. If not, I will go elsewhere and pay full price, as far as I'm concerned this is a SCAM."
1353,2,"Interesting it's hard to find a place online to write a review of the Honest Company! I had a bad experience with them. My friend gave birth recently so I wanted to send her a diaper cake as a gift since she never had a shower. I understand diaper cakes take time to make but I ordered one anyway, in addition to some bath items. A few days later, I checked on my order online and saw that it was REFUNDED because the item was NOT available. What the hell! I did NOT get an email notification about this so I tried to contact them by phone two days in a row (and I called in the morning) and there was NO response on their online chat system. I emailed them asking them to cancel the order because the diaper cake and bath stuff was meant to be a WHOLE gift order and why would I want to send half a gift!
A week after I placed my order, I got an email that said it went out (just the bath item). I then got another email from customer service that they can't modify orders once they are placed. Well that's hypocritical! You 'sell' me a diaper cake, but cancel it because you're incompetent to get it made. But yet I can't cancel my order, which was meant to be a gift set?
Their customer service is horrible and I would NEVER buy from them again. Disappointed, expected more from Jessica Alba (and I read her stupid book) but obviously it's all glitzy marketing and nothing to support the operational side."
1354,2,"I wish I would have come to this website and read reviews before I placed an order.
I received my items in a damaged box along with 2 damaged and 4 missing items. Also in the delivery, there was an open packaging to another individual with their home address. This mistake alone is extremely alarming me to me.
When I contacted customer service, along with all the other reviews, the wait was extremely long. I requested a call back and received a call back within two minutes. The rep that I spoke with said that I had to send her pictures of the damaged items if I wanted a refund or the items replaced. She said because of the error, she can send a shipping label so that I can ship the unwanted items back to them. So at this point, being extremely frustrated as to how my items were received, now I have to take time out of my busy schedule to take pictures, upload them and wait for a shipping label, find a box and take it to UPS to ship the items back.... Honest Company is not accommodating when they screw up and as a first time buyer who was really excited to try out their products, will never purchase them again."
1355,1,"honest diaper is sucks!!is there is a no star thing i would give zero to honest company!! my daughter suffered from burned in her private area, and which gave here a hard time peeing and having a trouble sleeping at night time and honest didnt do or offer anything about this!! that how horrible honest diaper! i tried to chat with honest customer service and they refused to give a compensation for my daughter damaged!! they didnt even offer any help,basically they said that go $#*! yourself!! horrible diaper, horrible customer serviced..not friendly at all...!"
1356,3,I ordered items in store via online because they didn't have the sizes available I needed. They told me it's the same prices in store would be honored online. However when I looked at my receipt I saw that wasn't true and I was charged almost double. When trying to contact customer service they refuse to do anything about it.
1357,2,"Ordered a gift on the 8th of December and still don't have it! Called Cslustomer Service and was told ""we're not FedEx. You need to call them to find your package."" Really?!! That's your idea of customer service? So much for the Christmas gift I ordered my niece! Heed the warnings and do. It ever order from this company. Lesson learned by me. Never again."
1358,3,"I placed the order on November 24th, and I have not received my package yet (20 days now). When I tried to contact them, it took forever to get someone on the line and finally after they responded they told me to track my package online (which of course I did already) and they also said that I should call the Fedex and find out where the package is. Me to call the Fedex and look where the package is?! What's wrong with u Carter's? I have been waiting for the order for 3 weeks, u took my money and now u r telling me to call around and find out what carrier has my package in possession. At this point , I don't need the package anymore, I just want my money back. Horrible customer service and care."
1359,2,"Within 60 seconds of placing an order, I contacted them to say that my old address was accidentally in the Ship To field.
Their response? Sorry, can't do anything. Can't even cancel the order.
I have spent a total of 3 hours on the phone with UPS, USPS and my credit card company to figure out what to do.
The call with them was ended with the employee saying ""And we cannot reimburse any fees associated with this order, discount you on shipping shipping costs, etc.""
Gee, thanks.
There are so many options out there for kids' clothing. No reason to ever shop here. I most certainly will not."
1360,3,"I don't know what's wrong with this company. Ordered over 50 dollars children clothes, and didn't receive the package. Even though i received an email saying the order was delivered, i checked everywhere, no package to be seen. I even checked the surveilance camera, no one came to drop off the package. I contact their customer supports, they basically saying, it is your own fault that you didn't received the package. They are using cheap shipping logistic last miles.. ups surepost... they shipping by the ups, but then transfer the package to usps to deliver the package.. and usps most of time deliver to wrong address or not deliver at all.. I meant you are a big company, you should be the one to make sure using reliable logistics to deliver the package. I basically lost money, and they don't want to do anything with it."
1361,2,"Unbelievable how frustated is to order online . have ordered 4 times and the 4 times my order has been canceled. when i call they say is due to being out of stuck, so why is still showing available to buy online? last time i ordered 5 items, they only shipped 2 of them whithout any notification asking if i wanted them after the other 3 items being out of stuck. this is so upseting and ridiculous. I will stick with Gymboree from now on."
1362,1,"This company is a waste of time and all they want is your money. I would give them zero stars if that was even possible. I placed an order for more than $400 which I was charged for right away. However, they never had the items in stock, but I only found this out when I emailed them two weekslater. A month after my purchase was made I cancelled my order as I never got my items. It took more than another month, countless emails, a PayPal claim that they never responded to, and a threat of going to the Better Business Bureau in order for them to refund my money. They told me that it would take 1-2 billing cycles to see my money, but if you pay through PayPal then all they have to refund the payment and you should have your money with in a week. They are thieves and any one that has posted a good review must work for them or is being paid to do so!"
1363,1,"Same sad story as some others. Item was said to be in stock, so I bought the item and was told it would be to me in less than a week, but after a week of nothing, I contacted the seller. I was told that it would be two more weeks before the item was even going to be in stock. No reason given, no apology. So I canceled my order. It has been a week since canceling my order and I still don't have my money back.
Stay away!!!!!!"
1364,1,"Why didn't I read the reviews! This place is TERRIBLE! I ordered a stroller 4 weeks ago. Never received it. When I emailed them to send it I was told it will be shipped next week. When I emailed them again they said it is delayed.
I'm still waiting for my refund.TERRIBLE!"
1365,3,"I'm utterly disappointed with the delivery service. I have ordered things from so many different sites and never experienced any issues. It's the first time that I'm writing a bad review for any company.
I Placed my first order on the 5th of April I think and after eight days when I didn't receive my order I called the helpline and they told me that I have been sent an email stating that my order has been cancelled because the required item is not in the stock but I never got any email, anyhow After a long argument I decided to place another order and today it's 7th of may almost a month and I haven't recived the order. On my enquiry to the helpline, she said that it's been shipped but one item is not sent because it couldn't pass through custom safety checks and nobody even bothered to inform me. You need to check the reviews before ordering things."
1366,3,"Thank you mumzworld for making this new year eve the worth, for my family, and more of that heart braking for my four year doughter, by smashing all of her believes into a crap. By the way she is still crying in her room for another third hour.. By calling 3 days in a row, and getting confirmations that I will receive my order on time, you just showed that you are a team of creepy sl.ts that will go for anything to get profit without having any care of kids you are to...order no600386033"
1367,3,"After waiting for 4 weeks to receive from item, it was small so I requested to return it. they want me tp pay 50dhs for collection even though they sent me an email saying that it will be free of charge. they want to make money from collection as well. how horrible is that."
1368,1,"Im writing based on my own experience. So I purchased an item paid 400 + a month ago and I've yet to receive my item. I wrote to the company asking where is my product they blame the manufacturer for the delay, turns out this website sells items that they do not have in stock. They take your money assuming manufacturer will give them their items and then give them to you; in other words they take your money hold it for over a month and they dont even have a hold of what they are selling. Reason I didnt buy directly from the manufacturer is because its clear on their website that they dont have it in stock. I spoke to someone from modern nursery askinh for an arrival date and they gave me a date i waited and nothing i told then i would like to cancel and they said "" are you sure""? Manufacturer no one has them only us, come to find out NOPE they were waiting for manufacturer to ship to them. Its a scam. Today I still have not received it. I was told id receive it by a certain dat and I just received an email saying the shipping was delayed. Honestly I feel lied to and of course I feel like they are playing with my money. See for yourself. Although I do wish your experience isnt as horrible as mines.good luck."
1369,1,"I tried to purchase a crib from this merchant times. They rejected my credit card payment 3 times, even though my bank approved it every time. Customer service was seriously unhelpful. They blame it on a customer and don't show any willingness to help. It is as if they didn't want to sell. I think they have some kind of system problem and get confused when billing address is not the same as shipping address. Overall, terrible experience. I should have read these reviews before. In the end, I bought from another merchant, using the same card and the same addresses, no problem."
1370,3,"Have never has such an experience with an online retailer in my life. Ordered a Bugaboo product through this company. All but one part arrived. No biggie, as assumed they simply forgot to send or a shipping issue since the website account said all shipments complete. The chat rep, Jasmine said the remaining piece won't ship until 2 weeks later which I was very surprised by since the website may no reference about a delay and received no messages of delay and the website itself did and still does show order complete and everything shipped. She said it was in the order confirmation that it won't ship until 30th. She offered to ""resend"". I let her know I never recieved any message saying that date, and took screenshots of the actual emails I did get from the order date until now. She then sent me a confirmation from her own email account, still not acknowledging that I never received that. And yes, not in spam either.
So their system messed up and it didnt send out a certain order email. Once again, normally no biggie, as the company would simply apologize, but in this case not at all. And the email she sent also says to check the website for order status, and I kept repeating the order status on the website makes no reference to the 30th ship date, and says the order is complete. She continued to ignore that fact and instead kept repeating it would ship on the 30th.
I used her name, Jasmine and the person said this is Devin the company owner. Which was quite interesting since right above every message including that one it says, Jasmine. So once again seems to be another bug in the system or Devin simply sat down at Jasmines computer and started replying. Normally when an owner gets involved things go smoothly since this is their business and name on the line.
He immediately asked what I wasnt understanding? I started to write a reply, since as you can see above its not a matter of not understanding its a matter of never being told part of the order would be late and most importantly their site still shows order as complete. But right after he asked the question it showed he was writing more. I asked him to stop typing so I can answer the question. He replied Excuse me. and disconnected the chat.
Seriously feel like Im being punked. I thought perhaps Jasmine simply said she was the owner, as hard to imagine and owner ever acting like the above, but did a quick search and appears they have a D on BBB, and 19 out of 22 similar reviews about the customer support on site jabber and other sites. My mistake for not researching their past rating history.
I'm reaching out to Bugaboo now so hopefully they can address this immediately with this vendor as well as filing a formal BBB report assuming I do not hear an valid explanation such as a rogue employee? The products that did arrive look great to note, and one box was damaged significantly upon arrival, but the FedEx man pointed that out, and I checked and confirmed what was inside was not damaged. So the box getting damaged may have just been a shipping issue.
Im sure the late pieces will eventually arrive, so this is not a complaint on the products, rather the absolutely atrocious customer support and owner experience. Had an actual part arrived damaged I cant imagine what it would have been like getting that resolved with them so once again, cannot repeat enough that you should avoid this company at any and all costs. If the company reaches out with an apology or improves their practices I will be sure update this accordingly but based on the responses to other complaints that does not seem likely.
UPDATE-
Just to note, there are multiple false statements in the store response. Never was I offered an expedited shipping from the start of the conversation to the end they mentioned it wouldn't ship until November 30th. No other expedited date was ever mentioned. They ""literally"" did not answer all my information 6 times. They did not and still have not explained why the website says order is complete and all shipments are sent. I asked multiple times but no response other than them closing the chat. The last statement was ""excuse me?"" from the owner after I asked him to stop typing so I could reply to his question asking what I was confused about. I like I imagine most all of the other reviewers here and on BBB and other review sites would much rather be enjoying our product rather than having to spend time writing these reviews, but I feel a duty to share my experiences good or bad so that others know where to spend their dollars. The false statements in the stores reply is concerning and I noted that in a reply to the owner. Apologies go a long way, and I imagine would work better than blaming customers. Hopefully this can be a learning experience for the company to improve."
1371,1,"I had ordered dog food from 1outlet. Price was reasonable (was not too low to be an obvious scam), and not too high to make me want to switch food. After waiting for about 5 weeks (estimated delivery time), I enquired if the food would indeed arrive on time (as per the indicated latest delivery time by 1outlet). The replied quite quickly to say that the seller than ran out of stock and I could either wait or get a refund. I chose a refund. That was in Feb. Its now May and I have not gotten my refund despite 1outlet saying it should take about one month to process. After sending them 4 emails to ask for an update, they have ignored me completely. These people are clearly scammers. They kept quiet about the ""out of stock"" issue and tried to reassure me about the refund in the hopes that I would forget about it, and that I would assume the refund was made. Do not be fooled. I am making a case report too."
1372,1,"This entire website is a scam. Please do not buy anything from this website. How is it possible that the products are available for you to add to your cart and just within the next 5 minutes, they say that they will ""refund"" you the full amount which they apparently did not. I called my bank to double check if they even had received any refund request but nothing. Their customer service is really bad as well. They do not reply you on the refund status and acts like a robot saying the same thing over and over again- it will take 30 days for you to receive that amount and you need to check with your bank. bs. Do not buy anything on this website or you will regret. I repeat. Do not buy.
And 1outlets.sg and to Barbara. P if you see this, please refund my payment immediately for my order #000059370."
1373,1,"I ordered an item, they acknowledged my order, charged my account. Then about 10 minutes later canceled the order. Said it would be 7-10 days to process a refund. They don't respond to emails, called them and they said they would contract me in 3 days. That was 10 days ago, and still nothing. I am in the process of filing a dispute with my bank, and my consider going to Singapore to file a police report. This is clearly theft and someone needs to be held accountable."
1374,1,"I have experienced this same issue with 1Outlet. Waited for the product well over time, when I questioned them was told the product had arrived in the country, then actually the supplier had never dispatched it, would I like the order through a different supplier or a refund? I said a refund and they have completely messed me around ever since (three to four months) I said I was going to contact the police and they send more emails saying give us 24 to 48 hours, several emails ago. Tonight I get this email.
Thank you, KAY! You have been a gracious customer. Thank you ;)
I am Sorry. We could have done better.
I hope we (our team, or my friends) managed to solve our issue.
May I ask you for help to do a very quick 1-question rating/review, please. It means a lot to me (to all of us).
Some reviewers (without real profile pictures or new accounts) would leave extraordinarily negative or hurtful reviews. (Your kind words or appreciation would really mean a lot. * smile *) this Festive Season, we like to thank you and also apologise sincerely for your inconvenience, I had attached herein a humble Promo code. (OF FIVE DOLLARS, IF I LOG IN TO MY ACCOUNT TO USE?) We pray that you have a fantastic year ahead. After my reply, another email was sent with no content.
I then got a little more assertive, lol leaving comments on their website and using the words police and jail. Happy to say I received a refund next day!"
1375,1,"Be prepared to lose your money if you order from this company! They take your payment, then apparently can't supply the goods, then promise a refund that never appears even after you receive numerous emails and even a personal phone call to tell you it has been issued. All done very nicely and politely to fool you into thinking they are offering good customer service, but they actually appear to be nothing more than crooks! Avoid!"
1376,1,"I would like to warn others to avoid this company. They are disorganized and unreliable. After 45 days my first order did not arrive. Customer service said the company failed to ship the order. I told them I wanted it and would wait. They said it had been shipped to me for sure this time, but close to a month later I received an email advising they were cancelling my order. The reason being some alleged restriction on shipping this to Thailand. Very irresponsible service. Looks like plenty of other customers have had their orders cancelled too. How unreliable. They promised a refund, I'm waiting....!"
1377,1,"Just as all others have said, this website is a SCAM. Any positive reviews on here must be fake. They charged my credit card the day I ordered the item and never sent it. I've contacted my credit card company and they are going to start a billing dispute to try to get my money back. Don't order ANYTHING from here. The prices are too good to be true."
1378,1,"I should've known this is a scam when the price is so much cheaper than the competitors. I ordered a play mat on 4/19, and it's 4/26 now, the order status is still showing ""processing"". I tried to call them, and it was a non-working number. That's enough to convince me that this is a fake company. I'm going to dispute my credit card charges with my bank today and report it to federal agencies. No one needs to be scammed by them again!"
1379,3,"Their site is functional, but they are not fulfilling orders. As people have already indicated, you place the order and then it just sits in ""order processing"" status indefinitely. The phone number rings busy and emails are not responded to. I am now going through the process with American Express to dispute the purchase and receive a refund."
1380,1,I ordered a $300 pillow in February 2018. My credit card was charged but I never received any shipping info. I called the company Zinc Door. They said my pillow was backordered and I should hear form them in May. I have not been able to contact the company since later May. I filed a complaint with the BBB. They now say there is nothing I can do. RIPPED OFF. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!
1381,3,"I was promised that a replacement part was going to be sent out immediately. Sandy had multiple emails with me, and though I even offered to pay for the shipping, I never heard from them again. This was 8 months ago and 3 more emails from me trying to understand what occurred. Terrible customer service. Beautifully designed, not great quality, and NO customer service. I'd much prefer having them tell me NO then lie to me and wasting my time. Disrespect has no place."
1382,1,"Spent $420 on two lamps ordered in September 2017. They charged my card same day. No lamps ever came. No updates ever came. When we finally got through to them they were not even upfront they lied and said they will definitely be on the way they were just not sure when. After 5 months in January we said we wanted our money back. They said they processed the return and we would get it in 3-5 days. Here we are in April and never got a penny back. Waiting 8 months for a product they never sent, took our money for and never refunded. So basically, they should be jailed, we were essentially scammed and robbed. To see unfortunately too late that these terrible reviews for this company go back to 2013, I can't believe this company was never shut down and continued to do business. How the people that run this business go home to their families and rest their heads at night is beyond me."
1383,1,I thought I purchased an item through Walmart but it turned out to be from Babyhaven via the Walmart website. The product wasn't what I thought it was and the vendor won't return it without my paying freight and them charging a restocking fee. It's a $10 item and not worth the $10 let alone paying all those fee's to return. Don't buy from them! They are terrible to work with.
1384,1,"I bought a baby gate plus an extension for about $75 from Amazon.com and two metal slats broke off rendering the gate useless. Just because we've had it for more than the 90 day return policy, BabyHaven's customer service refuses service. I won't buy BabyHaven's products ever again, and I recommend that everyone else stay away."
1385,1,"I ordered from them and I live in Israel. For 5 days my order was on processing status and didn't get shipped. I tried contacting them 3 times asking how long will it take for them to ship my order and got ignored. I tried later on contacting them through Facebook and asked to cancel the order, the person who spoke to me on Facebook chat told me they don't work for the department that is cancelling orders but they will email them. No one contacted me, no one cancelled my order and no one refunded me, they did however take 170 dollars from my PayPal. I tried contacting them again on Facebook demanding answers but got ignored again. On the same date I ordered from Babyhaven I also ordered from Asos and Next and my orders already arrived to Israel but babyhaven are still ""processing"" this is so annoying and looks like fraud to me. Stay away from this company!"
1386,1,"I ordered from ebabycarriers on Nov. 30, 2011 and Dec. 15, 2011 and I have never received my products. I have called and only gotten a machine that won't allow me to leave a message and I have emailed a couple of times and never got a response! STAY FAR AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE! They take your money and never give you the item you ordered! This is a fraudulent company if you ask me!"
1387,3,"Same experience as everyone else. Ordered baby sling on 11/19 with priority shipping (1-3 days). Received confirmation immediately. Emailed twice with no response, called several times to only receive a voicemail message. Finally on 11/29 called credit card company to cancel order. Definitely think twice about ordering!"
1388,3,"I HAD A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS SITE! I was so excited to find the moby wrap on this site for a lower price than I was finding it elsewhere and for cheap shipping! Plus the site advertised that if you ordered before 4pm they would ship it the same day. I ordered on a Thursday so I figured that at the latest I should receive it by the following Tuesday. Well, my credit card was charged the next day, but nine days later......no package yet. I emailed twice and got no response either time and called multiple times, every time getting a recording saying that I should call back later or email! Finally I used their live chat and demanded a refund! I guess I'll just have to wait and see if I actually receive it!"
1389,2,"I ordered a body pillow for $40. I emailed them concerning their return policies and procedures. I had to send a picture of the product plus measure the pillow and etc. We emailed back and forth until finally i got annoyed. The pillow is small enough for my 5 year old. Its not enough cushion in it for a pregnant lady like myself. All i wanted was to send the item back so i can find me something bigger and better. But after taking me through all of this, they can keep the 40.00 they need so desperately. What is the return policy ???? Thats all i wanted to know. I only had the pillow a few days. Why take me through email after email. Just tell me how to return it and refund me my cash !!!! Last time ordering from this site !!!!!! If something breaks or you are unhappy with it. Tough luck guys !!!!"
1390,1,"I ordered the pregnancy pillow in May 2018, it is now July 30th, and I still havent received it. I never got an email with a confirmation, or a tracking number. I have emailed them, Facebook messaged them, called....I have received no response except for automated ones on Facebook. its not an American company. They just have a US address and phone number. Im assuming theyre in China.
Never order from this site, its clearly disorganized and they take peoples money. Disappointed to be ripped off like that and wish I read the reviews first!"
1391,3,"I ordered a lamp from them , and I paid for the lamp and the insurance plus shipping , since march 18 ,,, in march 31 I received an email tellig me that the item was delivered , not true , and!!! i sent them an email , and they just keep telling me to ask the post office , or my neihbors , they dont rescpect and they dont respond for your purchase paid 30 dollars for that lamp."
1392,3,"1. You don't have to be a professor to tell that 90% of the positive reviews on this site has been written by the same person! Dating.com writes a lot of positive reviews here!
2. If you browse people at dating.com you will quickly notice that the same persons roll over the screen again and again. They have only about 100 profiles and most of them are fake profiles.
3. If you read the persons profiles you will find a looooot of inconsistencies. A 20 year old woman claims to be a doctor etc...!!!!
4. I've been there for a long time now and all these gorgeus ladies are STILL there! It seems that no one wants them or.... maybe they are just stationary profiles ment for sending you a few lines and then they stop writing when you want to meet or communicate OUTSIDE the site..."
1393,1,"DO NOT BELIEVE TO THIS SITE. - A NEW INTERNET SCAM. THEY ARE CHARGING YOUR MONEY VERY FAST, YOU ARE PAYING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR NOTHING. AS I SEE NOW THE SITE HAS A BAD REPUTATION. THEY ARE CHARGING YOU FOR READING A LETTER, WRITING A LETTER.
PEOPLE WHO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU, ARE NOT INTERESTED IN YOU, IT IS LIKE A FACTORY - THEY SEND THE SAME LETTER FOR EACH GIRL. A SHAME!!!
THEY ARE NOT READY TO RETURN MONEY. THE SITE MUST!!!! BE CLOSED."
1394,1,"So they are so good in charging your account... all is fake.. i have registered in 10 minutes ago and got 50 mans online messaging me with all sweet words as if they were waiting for my registration. I spent $22 already and still i am being asked to pay more and more if i want to read messages.
If you message your contact they disappear straight away..After every 3-4 exchange message they ask you to pay.
Not recommended even to try."
1395,1,"Every 5 star reviewer, has only given one review, all for AfricaBeauties.
These are all the same sites except they promote different women.
AfricaBeauties, AmoLatina, AnastasiaDate and AsianDate.
Obviously, the site is pushing:
fake reviews.
fake photos.
fake profiles.
If they are willing to fake reviews, they are capable of faking profiles, emails and chat.
Don't waste your time or money on AfricaBeauties.
Use a large American owned site, based in the U.S.
You can search for foreign girls or someone local.
Only use a site chargng a low monthly fee with unlimited emails, chat.
No smart person pays to view on a dating site, for:
videos, photos or accepts a charge by the minute in chat."
1396,1,"I met a lady on this site. Thought that I was going to be with this woman. Stupid me, I even sent money to this woman so that she can contact me. I never got an email, or a call from her. I only called her. She used the money for shopping she said. I give her the benefit of the doubt, and fly to Ethiopia to meet her. ALL BAD!!! More money scammed, and we never even got close to anything real besides sex. Other than that, I just got used! I thought this was maybe a bad pick, so I tried again... Three times! All with the same result! This is a huge scam! Do not fall for it!"
1397,1,"I have used other African dating sites and this is without doubt the worst with the most fake profiles. I had an insider calling me from Ghana and telling me what was going on. There is a man who organises this in Accra and it is big business designed to part stupid white westerners like me from our cash. I even complained to the website office in USA (apparently) but to my surprise I got a rash of unsolicited phone calls and emails from a guy in Ghana who seemed to know the details of my concerns. Every mail or call sought to reassure me but, if you are interested I can tell you about the foolish mistakes they made. Anyway, avoid this site like the plague. If there are any genuine women here I'll be very surprised. Ideally I'd like to get it removed, erased, prosecuted. That's not to say some sites like AfroIntroductions are just as bad (they're not), but this one just about scrapes the barrel...it stinks!"
1398,3,"Before POF I didnt know there was so many single moms about. I've never seen so many woman on there who have had children out of wedlock and now are looking for someone to bring the children up as their own. They cant all have been divorced so they just seen to have churn children out with no regard.
I have no intention of being 2nd in a relationship as they tell you the children will always come 1st. I did laugh how they still think they are a catch when they have this baggage.I also laugh when they put profession down as mum or yummy mummy. That's not a job its a lifestyle choice.
The rest are either fraudulent profiles wanting you to click for webcam stuff or blatant prostitutes or just really unattractive MUTANTS that other men in the outside world have rejected so they have gone online and set up a profile looking for a dream man who must be tall dark and handsome.
The mutant women also seem really obsessed with putting up tattoo photos of the legs arms and rest of the body.
they say you must love dogs and if not don't contact them.
They come across as picky demanding rude and you see why alot of profiles proudly proclaim they are back again!!! As if its something to brag about.
The fraudulent scammers now message you saying they need your help or they message you saying can I say something?
I dont know if the people running the site cant deal the sheer demand of scammers or whether they dont care but cant be that hard to ban IP addresses.
0/10 and thats generous."
1399,3,"Plenty of Fish or POF is not that bad, yes the layout and the script is not as fancy as other websites but still works. I've managed to meet a few ladies from there, just regular ladies, not Miss Universes or something like that. Real people for real times. Yes, there are the picky ones and also the mean ones, like any other website but its free and you can get almost all the benefits without paying (there are a couple of profiles when you are told you have to upgrade to chat with these which I consider somewhat of a scam but these are only a few) therefore you can get something done for you.
POF has potential if you give it a try."
1400,2,"OKC is so much better. There are so many off characters on POF that I've wasted time on. One of them was already in a long term relationship and they were looking to cheat. Another lives with his parents, unemployed and kept making excuses as to why he wasn't going to look for one. After our first and last date he said he only wanted to be friends but not before negging me over how I supposedly look different than I did in my photos (No one has ever told me this before until then) then had the nerve to say that my outfit wasn't flattering for my body type. I'm sorry but what heterosexual man cares about what a woman wears? Anyway, I ended up closing my account and found someone better on OKC :)."
1401,3,"I have used OKCupid for a few years. It progressively gets worse, but at this point I do not know how it could get worse, but it probably will. The site sends me messages that someone messaged me. But does not tell me who. And there are no messages in my Inbox. At least half of the profiles are women who have answered exactly 15 questions, are young, attractive, have one picture, and are completely fake or in Indonesia,,,,I guess the competition is just too great, and this site failed to evolve."
1402,3,First having to pay and this is with all online dating site. I believe we should paid when we get a date or at least a trial. Now on to this site the interface suck and some profile are fake but the worst is the people you meet on here they don't read profile and many women give one word answers.i am currently dating someone from there and it not how I imagined let just say she is not ready to date. I would get into the story but it making my head out thinking about it.
1403,3,"It is designed to keep you just interested, but not to find you a relationship. I guess if it did, they will lose business. In terms of this, this site (as well as most dating sites) is a scam.1. Your message is not directly delivered. Your message is only visible to the receiver if they ""like"" you. I do not understand why any person would write a proper introduction to someone or more than a few words because the chances of your message being read is nearly non-existent.
2. The matching process is superficial. You're basically matched by the pictures and a small introduction, assuming there's mutual ""liking"" of these two criteria. As mentioned above (no.1), there's no mutual selection happening based on a conversation. Looks do matter, but when there's profile after profile to choose from, the selection process becomes too superficial.
3. They do not show all available profiles in your area, so good luck if you live in a small town. Every time I refresh the browsing page, the same few people shows up. As I've found out, you must ""pass / unlike"" them in order to have a new person shown to you. Algorithms are against users in this case.
4. Difficult to find people based on interests because they only allow their own keywords under the search options.
Overall, I found Okcupid to be a huge waste of time, a platform designed to defeat the purpose it's meant to do from a customers' point of view."
1404,3,"I remember Myyearbook being successful and I absolutely LOVED the way you could make your profile spunky, play fun games, and donate your time to the 'Save the Planet' thing they had going on (I was #21 at one point). I had so many memories back in 2007-2010 doing all the fun activities.
I logged on some years later and to my HORROR, they changed the name to Meetme and made the once-fun website into just another low-ranked 'dating' website for weird men to slip a dic-pic into your DMs. All of my personal notes from old friends were completely gone, I lost connections with people I used to talk to online on a daily basis, and the quirkiness of MYB has been completely erased. Whoever changed it to F***Me should be resign or be fired because the new update is a disgrace to my generation."
1405,1,"Here's the profile breakdown of this app/site:
85% are foreign (west African) dating scams or spam bots.
The other 15% are real people, lying about their location to make money off the ""live"" cam section or are prostitutes. They should not market this as a dating app, it's simply another cam site. They allow their users to manually change their location, opening up a whole door for scammers and con artists. You don't see nearly as much of this on Tinder or Bumble, but for some reason MeetMe likes having a reputation of being the biggest scam dating app in history. DO NOT TRUST ANYONE ON THE SITE. Don't send phone numbers, email addresses or anything private. 90% of the time its going to be used in another scam. ITS AN AWFUL APP!!"
1406,1,"The ratio of bots to humans there is like 100 to 1. You will lose your mind and hours of time initiating conversations with bots that will keep saying Hi to you followed by a message, something like, go to this website and register for free, yet they will attempt to charge you money even though the initial lie says it's free. Straight up bot infected scam pit."
1407,1,"This site is VERY shady. And beware, if you sign up for a ""one day"" subscription, you may find yourself getting recurring charges. I deleted my account and a few days later still got a charge of 79 cents. I deleted my account because the site already said my credit card was unlinked, so it was my last resort option, and STILL I am getting charges.
Speaking of which, they make deleting your account next to impossible. The delete screen starts starts with the classic trick of showing a big blue button that says ""Stay on Hot or Not"" with a small gray link below it that says Delete Account (trying to get you to accidentally click the big blue button instead). After a couple of screens like this, you are then asked to enter your password (AND enter a captcha, but I digress), but if you signed in via Facebook, you will have to actually first click ""forgot your password"" and create a password. Of course, this redirects you to a new page and you have to start all over. Eventually, you figure it out and delete your account, but if you pay attention there is all sorts of subtle trickery on the site to try to get you to click wrong buttons."
1408,3,"Call your credit card company immediately and dispute the charge, tell them you didn't get what you paid for. If you live in TX, the Credit Card company will cancel the charges if you complain within 3 days. So, my recommendation is you not spend a dime with them, but take advantage of what they offer for free, and no more. There were some women that I had to pay to contact, I think those women don't exist. I paid, contacted them, got no reply, and noticed that my location changed from my home city to a city 5 hours away. I communicated with another member, and her home city was incorrect. When I complained to HotorNot support, they said Sorry Charlie, you already paid, used some of the credits, we won't refund you, we won't credit you back he coins, and heck we won't fix the city to be correct, they didn't actually say all those words, just 'sorry charlie'. I called my credit card company to complain to get my money back. Also, they seem to point you at potential dating partners in cities in different states than you are."
1409,3,"Is it wrong to put in the profile that I'm NOT into trans people? I'm a STRAIGHT MAN. I want children and a family in the future and I'm not out to randomly have sex with anyone and everyone. I'm on the date apps to meet someone special. I barely even chatted with anyone, other than the hellos and complimentary small talk, let alone spew anything hateful against a trans person because obviously I'd swipe left for non-cis women."
1410,1,"I was a Match.com member and I completed my guarantee period which entitled me to a free six month extension of my membership. Match.com charged my card anyway. I disputed the charge with my bank and Match.com took action! They closed my account, blocked me and banned me forever. They refunded the charge, but I lost my free six month service extension. All I wanted to do was prevent Match.com from illegally stealing my money. The facts speak for themselves. There aren't enough adjectives to describe how incompetent and deceitful they are!"
1411,1," signed up 15/08 to the site and thought it would be an honest place since it's for mature people. I was emailed by this man on the site. He's a longstanding member of Match as well & i suspect many other sites. He & i exchanged a few emails where he started using what looked like common interests & other tactics in order to gain your trust & a false bond. He bored me with what i thought was his life story. Even revealing details that should remain private about his family.
He confessed he had been 'stalking' me & many other exotic women (black hair, dark olive skin, dark eyes) everyday for months. His type- asian, middle-eastern, mediterannean, mixed race or black.
He will feed you a load of fantasy & lies about his life in order to gain trust & then progress onto sexting, phone calls & a one night stand or two. Perhaps even for a few months. Before he starts backing away two-timing you & ready to go onto the next victims. It must take some planning.
I learnt that this is what he does 24/7 everyday. He very quickly suggested we exchange phone numbers and started texting each other.
He sounded reasonably educated and said he worked in finance. Lo & behold he preys on both victimised women with problems as well as well groomed educated career types. The photo he uploaded with him standing around a couple of nice cars is far from the reality. A rusty old car sitting on bricks & a tiny old two-seater that regularly breaks down is the actual reality.
He is a sad looking balding sight, with a pockmarked hairy back resembling a crocodile's & talks about nothing else but his past conquests ex-wives, ex-girlfriends & horrible family. Btw the ex girlfriends also fill in as F-buddies, so beware.
His health problems sound like a publication in a health journal for grubby diseases. ED could just about, be excused if he had a monogamous bone in his body. He does not & has never practiced safe sex. Don't expose yourself girls to horrible stds. His mouth is not just for stringing out lies, it's been part of this dangerous man's tools for picking up disease from the immoral individuals like himself & passing it on & endangering the health of otherwise healthy unsuspecting women.
He is mentally ill, a penniless hoarding hermit living in a small village, South of UK, sorrounded by dust mites & mildew, living in one room in a dark dingy delapidated rented grimy dirty smelly house, with decaying food, filthy carpets covered in other women's hair, dirty underwear, dry skin particles & heaven knows what else. The stacks of dusty old newspapers are a sight to behold. He has nothing to offer anyone. He might try to fool you by mentioning how it would be nice to settle down get married & have children soon. Don't fall for it. It's nothing but a string of lies.
Just a warning girls. Don't fall for the attention & attempts to win your sympathy. You are simply one of many that he has on the loop. Very soon a matter of weeks or months, you'll soon be faced with stark reality as he starts the disappearing act saying ""We could be better as friends"" as the entire act is being played all over again on the next victims. You've been warned. Give him a big miss!"
1412,3,"Not sure how they are not shut down? The beautiful women on this site are not real. Many women use the site. Match purposely trys to entice you in with fake profiles. I have had all kinds of women on other sites show interest and I have been able to message them without additional little charges, even if they are not paying members. Within 2 days on another site I am talking with 6 different women on whatsapp."
1413,1,"I signed up for one month. Canceled in two weeks. I had 7 scammers. Only a couple legit men. The scammers were all ""Widowers"", mushy emails to me. Then ask for my phone number and email address. I said, ""I would rather communicate through the Chemistry.com website."" Never heard from them again. Watch out ladies, more scammers out there than real men looking for a partner."
1414,3,"Suddenly now bogus text messages started arriving from a dating site which I had never signed up for........is Chemistry.com owned by match.com?
What crap....can't these companies be banned for fraud?
Here's the format of one such message""
""Txtme6463974027 is interested in getting to know you and has sent you an email""
Of course, there is no ""unsubscribe"" link and if one clicks on ""change my e-mail options"" there is no possibility to ""unsubscribe"". Anything which one undertakes to get off of their spam list requires log in."
1415,1,"I was on tinder and got three dates per week and was a bit overwhelmed by the response so decided to get serious and go to eharmony so I'd only be communicating with people who wants a serious relationship. I used the exact same pictures and personal information and got nothing.
The only people I got a smile from were either 70 if they were a day or really obese and one was emaciated. I take health serious and made that very clear.
I think eharmony is done and don't have anyone bothering to pay theses days. I sent smiles to every match for 3 weeks and got not one reply so I'm guessing they are all fake profiles. Not one reply after the same pics and info got overwhelming response on Tinder. Eharmony is almost all fake profiles now.
Oh and one was clearly a foreign scammer and begged me to contact his friend Harold who really liked me lol. I got an email saying he had been removed. The matches were often 200-300 miles away even though I said a 30 mile limit.
Honestly do not waste your money!
I asked for a refund on day 15 as I couldn't get through on the number and was told no. The best they could do was cancel the repeat subscription after the 6 months I've paid for and they will let me give my subscription to someone else. My friends just laughed and said no thanks.
Really just go on Tinder. It's a serious option now and the paying ones are done.
5 years ago I did a 3 month eharmony and got 10 dates in 6 weeks. This time nothing"
1416,3,"I receive 'matches' that aren't genuine, trolls or the like and always have an excuse not to meet up with you. How to tell.
1. Only one or two photos- most pixalated and out of focus.
2.Profile is never complete.
3. Always always have a last minute excuse for not meeting.
4 Have sent you a smile, but not read your profile.
5...Chat about stuff that is has nothing to do with the current conversation."
1417,2,"I had a paid membership on this site for two months, from February 8, 2019 to April 8, 2019. I did not renew but my profile was still active. Today they closed my account for unknown reasons and sent emails to everyone I ever interacted with that I am some kind of scammer. Well, I soon found out the reason, it seems that a woman I went out once seven weeks ago fabricated some kind of story about me because I did not call her back. I know because she wrote me to gloat about it. I could care less that they closed my account, it is a terrible site with few matches less that three or four hours away, but impugning my character to others with no factual basis is too much. These people are the worst."
1418,1,"The first thing Tinder did was banned me for no reason, no explanation. I started a second account and did not disclose my real age due to personal reasons. On my birthday, I decided to check my account and my real age was posted. How in the $#*! did y'all find out my real age and then decide to post it without my permission?This has to be illegal and definitely an invasion of privacy. I know this company will not last long and will face charges. I will file a lawsuit against you and you will have to pay. So thanks Tinder for being jackasses and for my lifelong settlement to come."
1419,3,"My newly turned 17 year old, able to just change his birthdate, find an older young person after being told it's ""a easy way to get laid !"" I'm at fault as a mother, but now I have a twenty year old, sexual confused young lady living w me after an abusive family life finds her on our doorstep Easter night w no where to go! I hope she's not Cat fishing my son but after only a few visits, and lots of phone conversations who knows! After giving her three weeks to come up w plan, I fear my son will be gone w her! Tinder is known for their easy hook up site! My son was encouraged to use the site from other kids at his college for easy pick ups. And yes a 17 year old is still a kid."
1420,1,"I was banned by tinder multiple times because bigoted users would report my account because I am genderfluid. Tinder would then promptly ban my account. For a while tinder support would reinstate my account but all the sudden they tell me that I've gone against their terms so they will not reinstate my account. That is bull$#*!...the only crime I committed was being genderfluid. Tinder discriminates and denies services to those who are not ""male"" or ""female"". So disgusting. Never ever use this app."
1421,1,"So frustrated. Tired of wasting money on this site. So done. If you get a guy that doesn't write English well. Says you ""look pretty good"" lol, and doesn't understand expressions like ""oh dear, gotta run"" ... Clear sign he's a scammer. Unfortunately, can't trust any of them anymore. This latest one wants to send me money from Belgium to buy him a house.. hahahahahaha.
Online dating is just a giant waste if time. That, and men are $#*!s. May have to resign myself to being perfectly content single. I am my own best company. My kids too!"
1422,1,"I think the positive reviews are from paid employees of quickflirt.com because if there are real, active women on there, I saw very little evidence.
First, you can't write anything about yourself. As soon as I wrote something and submitted it, it disappeared. It seems like most of the profiles have the same problem, as they're mostly blank. I contacted customer service and they told me to email them what I wanted on my profile and they would post for me. What a hassle and what if they mess it up?
Secondly, I received a lot of messages, like ""Care to chat?"" or ""I want to get naughty with you."" I would respond and hear nothing back. I believe they were bots. They could have been real members, as there's an option to allow the site to send out a message you've composed and appear to browse profiles to help get interest in yours, but it doesn't seem like the women, if they're are real, are active on the site.
Finally, in order to delete your profile and discontinue your membership, you have to call customer service. They do their best to keep you on the site, offering 7 days free and a free upgrade, but it's a waste of time and money.
This site is designed to make money, not get you a date. Stay away!"
1423,3,"On another site gave my number to a person so she could text me. Got the text and she said she saw me on quick flirts. Her number didn't check out with a name therefore a non registered phone. She wasn't in the state that the number was from. The profile on the site of first contact didn't match what she text me. The picture she texted also didn't the description she sent. I know people disguise themselves for safety but outright lies post me off. So a second number texted me out of the blue. She said got my profile on quick flirts. I don't have a profile on quick flirts, lie #1. I ask first and last name and city where she's from. First and last name did not check with the state she gave me even though I ask for city, lie #2. When I asked for truth she, if it was a she, responded, $#*! you. Sorry, I obviously will not trust quick flirts or the site I'm on any more. You should make your own decision. What I described was my experience. I know there is good and bad people everywhere. All they're doing is ruining what could be a fun thing."
1424,1,"I thought i would just take a peek at it. No profile for me and no photos of me. I logged off with no interest, especially after the reviews. They had already hacked into my computer and I was getting pop-ups in the lower corner with someone wanting to chat. Mind you, I did no profile or photos. TOTAL SCAM! DO NOT JOIN!"
1425,1,"Loveshack tells you why. Look at all of the middle-aged and older couples on here, who dont know what theyre doing. Even when older posters are giving relationship advice, its flawed.
As a young woman, heres the message that I want to give to young posters who join Loveshack.
Why would you want to trust a bunch of old divorcees, who brag about banging 24-year old women? Why would you trust posters, who cant even type and spell properly? Chances are that you are more educated and informed than the baby boomers on there. Why would you trust people, who dont take responsibility for their failed relationships? Its sad when the original poster will make their ex look crazy, when they are part of the problem.
People are happy that this forum is back, because it enables their dysfunction and insecurity. Youre better off sharing your problems elsewhere. These people arent qualified to help you. This isnt the best relationship forum out there. Its not worth a young persons time."
1426,1,William and his other moderators ruined the site with their constant meddling in discussions. Any little thing could get you banned. The site was filled with a lot of feminazis who didn't hesitate to hit the report button because they didn't like a post. William played favorites with a lot of the female members and let them post whatever they wanted. I'm glad the site is gone. It was a very toxic site. Good riddance.
1427,1,"ALERT, ALERT, ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Prior to joining Cupids Coach, I personally researched several one-on-one match making services; five to be exact. In addition to researching companies online, I interviewed three in person and two by phone.
Julie Ferman, owner of Cupid's Coach was one of the services I've interviewed in person, She convinced me by her sales pitch and promise to introduce me to well established men. She explained that Cupids Coach had a very good screening process for candidates and that men paid higher fees to sign up for the service.
My biggest concern, which I expressed to Julie, was ""inventory"". Was there really a large enough pool of men that have paid thousands of dollars to find love, and would be interested in a woman over fifty years old? Julie claimed that 'mature women' were her 'specialty'. Against my better judgment, I signed up for the service and paid a substantial, large amount of money.
After being a member of Cupids Coach for less than a month, I have learned real quickly that my concerns were very valid. I've started to question 'candidates'. As it turns out, many of them came from family members or friends of the owners or other dating sites. They never paid any money to the service. Of the few men I came across that had paid, at one time or another had been in the system for years. Further, by their own admission, they were surprised to hear from the service. Some of the candidates even admitted, that they were promised three free other dates if they would go out with a particular woman -- probably an older woman or one who was promised something that Cupids Coach is finding hard to deliver.
Most of the candidates were not up to the 'established standard' as Julie told me they would be. Many were struggling financially and were no where near where I am in my life. This, by the way, was one of my strong demands. Candidates had to be on the same level living standard than myself or better. Some of the gentlemen who did not pay for the service, were not into serious dating and even rude at times.
Julie and her co-worker threw anything my way that probably would agree to go out with me.
However there was no matching, no consideration!!! When I approached the service, I was handled as if I was a difficult candidate, asking too much for my age. Excuses and more sales pitches were given to make up for the lack of good, established clients on their part.
I'm writing this to warn anybody, who considers spending any money on this particular dating service. There is not a lot of information out there and frankly, the better business bureau takes to much time upon people to get anything achieved. Thank God for the information age, so with a little research, innocent hardworking men and women can be protected from such services."
1428,1,"First BEWARE Julie is now working under JULIE FERMAN LLC, but she still the same. Here's my review of Cupid's Coach.
BEWARE of Cupid's Coach. Look them up in the Better Business Bureau, Complaint Board website, Private Complaints website or simply look up ""Cupid's Coach complaints"". The negative reviews and formal complaints speak for themselves. Join Plenty of Fish and/or OKCupid for FREE. Join MeetUp.com and meet people that way too.
I'm writing an update because I have now received two calls from Julie Ferman pleading with me to take the post down. The first call she asked me if I would change my mind if she offered me free membership. I refused. I wish I would have been smart enough to have researched and read a review like mine or any of the others to have refused the meeting. I do not want anyone else to go through the horrible experience I went through with her representative Courtney Hughes. At the end of the interview when she walked me to the elevator and I had made it crystal clear that I would not be writing a check she said to me ""Grace, I don't want to sound like a b*tch, but you really are starting to look 40."" I will never forget that. She knew of my impending 40th birthday and knew that a single women would be sensitive and vulnerable to such a comment. I could have answered many things considering she was older than myself, unmarried and had an ugly telephone exchange with her teen age daughter while I was there filling out forms. Instead I told her that I looked 40 because I was turning 40 and that's what 40 looks like and that I was ok with that.
I wrote the post on Yelp to warn or at least arm ladies from what they would be greeted with at Cupid's Coach. Julie Ferman, the owner called me weeks later about my post. Julie said that my experience with Courtney was not how she trained her reps to behave and then when I refused to delete my post she said I was being ""vindictive"" because she wouldn't fire Courtney, when I had not suggested any such thing. BTW, Courtney is now at Organic Matchmaker.
The second call from Julie was Saturday (12/15/2012), where again she said she wanted me to delete the post because it was causing her to lose clients. I told her once again that her service was one of the worst experiences I have had as a single women. She then said that I should seek therapy for the ""emotional scar"" that the interview had caused. Again, no one said ""emotional scar"" it was a truly horrible and hurtful experience. The berating is part of Cupid's Coach tactics as confirmed by Julie's calls. BEWARE READ THE REVIEWS and even the satisfied ones because we know they are phony, like the service. Julie, do not call me anymore, unless it is for advice on how to better serve single people looking for love. I will not change my post. You are not a nice person in my opinion.
Please see Julie's track record by checking out Cupid's Coach and the better business bureau under Cupid's Coach. The name change is a transparent attempt to shake her past performance. See my review and notice how the positive reviews seem or are entirely similar to the ones in this company.
JULIE-please don't contact me to change my review again. The only reason I'm posting is because I received an email from one of your previous clients thanking me for my post and letting me know what you are up to. Shame on you.
Okcupid, match, eharmony and meetup.com for singles groups with similar interests are great ways to meet other singles.
If you need a dating coach, are over 40 check out Bobbi Palmer (DateLikeAGrownUp.com). Bobbi is one of her own success stories.
Please do your research before you sign anything. Thank you for reading. Good luck."
1429,3,"I found this website after listening to another dating coach's recommendation. I read all the reviews in my location/area?; there were only 12 and two of them were written almost exactly alike, as if they were written by only one person,five years apart, however there were two different names for these reviews, one was Lowell B. and one was ToddW.!! This makes me suspicious enough to avoid this dating website and the fees quoted in some reviews were outrageous! Sounds like the owners are just preying on lonely people."
1430,1,"The site is a good idea in theory but the awful webmaster spoils it. He really doesn't care about the atmosphere on the site, or whether the site works properly.
He lets people get away with very unpleasant behaviour, and from what I've heard he speaks more harshly to the moderators, who are doing the best to keep the site pleasant in sometimes difficult circumstances, than he does to the trolls!
Also the site is full of bugs that never get fixed. And the webmaster never replies to e-mails. And if the bugs don't prevent you from sending messages, you'll find that unfortunately most members have such bad mental health problems that they can't keep up a regular correspondence.
The chatroom is sometimes OK though.
Overall I'd say that the site probably isn't worth joining."
1431,1,"In theory the idea of this site is a good one. In reality you get a whole bunch of very dysfunctional people who are more mentally ill than they will admit to.
Whether it's the women or men, be very careful. Lots of game players, liars, people pretending to be someone they are not.
You don't want to invite a disaster into your life, but truth be told, I would not bother with this site at all."
1432,1,"I made this because I kind of like crazy girls but its really not worth it what so ever. Out of the couple hundred results that popped up only 2...yes exactly 2 no exaggeration.. Have been on in the past year. I got a message(oh lucky me..NOT) and it didn't show me anything until i paid 10 dollars for a membership. I opened the message and replied. This whale lord who messaged me was not only a total 0/10 (maybe even a negative rating HAHAHA) but boundary breaking and stalkingly annoying. She/it put one face pic up and me trying to be nice gave her/it my Instagram. The IG was private and was not revealed until a few DMs. I wish I hadn't even paid to see the messages to be brutally blunt. This lady was the size of a 6 foot tree with branches and all. She had the audacity to message ME, an easy 7 on a bad day and a 10 on my best to some girls/women in the past. Is she that mentally unsound that she thinks someone of her disgusting kooks can message ME...let alone keep doing it once i saw her pictures and stopped replying?? What the hell dude! She was also making me uncomfortable. Asking about dates and saying i needed sex...LADY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR CONCIOUSNESS. WHY IN THE LORDS NAME WOULD I GET INTO THAT THE FIRST 5 SECONDS WE TALK?!?!?!? The username was Conifertree for anyone who needs a heads up. If you see her on the page BLOCK her immediately! Oh man that fache gives me the chills. SMFH.... Anyway screw NLL and screw whoever's left on that b.s. Aside from having nobody left, the people there are low quality and theyre delusional where they have a heightened ego. I looked up miss Conifer Tree on Google and her files lie about her having a 6/7 figure income and one page even has a picture of a pretty girl...NOOO CATFISH!!!!!!!! I feel downright insulted and utterly contaminated that this creature messaged me and that I stooped to the lowest common denominator and engaged the beast in conversation. Yuck! Get off this terrible site and use another one. I want that 10 dollars back!"
1433,1,"As a professional thought perhaps this was the proper more "" distinguished"" way to encounter online dating.....now much more well read & seasoned this Toronto Matchmakers Scam is a total misleading RIPOFF!!! I actually feel foolish to have entrusted their company & would be ashamed of myself if I were one of their employees misleading people whom are vulnerable & easily swayed. They bring you in for an interview bedazzle you (with false hope ) took like 8 months before I had a date & could have probably found better playing a guitar @ the liquor store....yes its almost comical. Shame on this company for such false advertising....dont be foolish & waste money here friends it....hate to admit I was a fool...but lesson learnd so just warning all of you."
1434,1,This company puts pressure on you to sign a contract without letting you read through it. Watch out because whatever they do they protect their scam in the contract. Your money is gone and they give you no guarantee of the service. All they say is they give you referrals and they screw you over...now you have to deal with lawyers and more to get a dime back...if at all.
1435,1,"I joined the Toronto Matchmakers in Aug 2018 (about 5 months ago) There was a lot of pressure from Joanna to sign up during the interview, I did and wish I hadn't.
I purchased 6 referrals and was told it can take a maximum of 8 weeks to find the first match, but that there were lots of available men in my area looking for what I was, so there should be no problem! I provided my deal breakers and #1 was a non-smoker.
I called at month 3 to ask what was happening, they found me a match in Nov, he was a smoker? Did they not read my deal breakers?
Silence since, I have called a few times and been told ""be patient"" At this point I just want my money back as I have no faith in them and their guarantees appears to be false.
It has been 5 months and nothing unless I call and am told they are searching? My lawyer is suggesting a complaint to the BBB and start blogging etc but at this point if I get a full refund I will go quietly. I wish I had never signed up and don't recommend anyone else doing so!"
1436,1,"I responded thoughtfully to over 60 ""interested"" women, whom I either staight up matched with, they favorited me, or winked at me. I took the time to read all of their fake profiles! What a complete waste of time! I am well spoken and not considered to be unattractive, yet I received not ONE single response... and they were supposedly the ones that initiated! Total fraud! Keep your money and go to Tinder or Match."
1437,1,"You will start as a free member. All the sudden your mailbox will be blowing up with cute singles waiting to talk to you but wait.. you have to pay a subscription in order to see what they said. So you do it. None of these cute singles ever say a word to you. Every time you don't look at the app for an extended period of time, some new cute singles want to meet you.. so you go back on and message them. And never get a response. It's a complete sham and I hope the website gets shut down."
1438,1,"It's a scam! it feels like bots are sending you likes and chat requests because none of them seem to read your profile. You get tones of likes and chat requests from ""members"".
I even saw the same pictures used for multiple ""accounts"". Even the account info is very different between the two!
If you try to reply, guess what, you have to pay, so i did! Guess what happened? Everything stopped! No more likes, no chat form the one saying they really wanted to chat with you because they were ""really"" interested."
1439,3,"I am not so young anymore and was looking for a relationship or partner and begin January I subscribed CS and look out who I will meet. Everything begin with mutual likes and sometimes a mail. The first woman was from Norway lived in the US but was for her ""business"" in Turkey, lovely chats etc etc and she asked me using 'Hangouts'. Before I didn't know that instant chat app but I give it a try. Not yet 5min after the first use she showed me a Turkey's Custom paper she had to pay within 24 hours if not she could not shipping her goods to Oslo and asked me to send her 6400 euro and she will return me that money when she come visit me. I am not stupid and I stop all contact.
The second one lived in Australia but has to go Texas (US) where her father was brought to hospital for an urgent surgery on his brain but she could not pay the bill for that surgery.....what come next I don't have to tell anymore, we all can guess.
It was not so a big surprise because that kind of woman are 30y more younger than me but in the beginning I will give them the benefit of the doubt. At moment I mail with nr.3 I found in the USA region but after she say she lives in Russia, but when I analyse our mails I see many things not corresponding with my questions and give me answers not belong to my questions. Now I acting like we can have something nice what I doubt and will lookout how far and how long it takes before she posed me the one million dollar question. I really doubt there are serious dating sites even paid dating sites are not a guaranty and I experienced that after one time......membership fee lost. I really miss the time ICQ instant chat form years before that time there was not one scam but nice and good pen pals friends."
1440,3,"I joined this site yesterday for the first time. I received many messages. Most of them were from men very faraway from me, so I politely replied with ""Thank you, but we are too far away"". I didn't contact anyone first. I just replied to the received messages. After some time the site blocked me and prevented me from replying to messages. Whenever I tried to reply to someone's message I got this info: ""You have exceeded the limit for Messages in a 24 hour period. You may try again in 24 hours.
We appreciate your cooperation."" What kind of rule is that??? You can chat with ONLY ONE MAN and exceed the message limit for the day and since you cannot reply he might think that you ignore him and you are not interested in him! What a terrible dating site!"
1441,2,"Tom's Hardware has shifted from providing honest reviews and comparisons of hardware to pushing Nvidia's latest line of GPUs when they themselves haven't even benchmarked or tested them yet. When a company tells you they recommend you buy a product when they themselves couldn't have possibly tested it, you know that they cannot be a solid reference point. I would avoid this website at all causes. It'll never be able to restore confidence in their brand."
1442,1,"The site isn't secure, those 5 star ratings are just multiple accounts and its forum aint helpful but full of spammers and scammers who tries to trick you to buying their items even though that you can speed up your computer manually by just following a youtube tutorial or by learning computer science.
I recommend that you should go shopping using your body not your phone and hands, so you can get help, assistance and get your work and problems done that using this site which was an ad all along."
1443,1,"I made the mistake of Googling a fix for the chroma keyboard problem (chroma key effects freeze on Orbweaver and require a reboot to clear, a known bug with Razer software) and clicked on a link to Tom's Hardware. After only reading for 10 seconds the screen was interrupted with a notice stating that the site wanted me to share location information to continue viewing. I made the mistake at taking them at their word, DON'T CLICK ON THE BUTTON ALLOWING THEM INFORMATION!!! Just leave the site, quickly!
I made the mistake of trusting clicking yes and from that point on began having annoying popups appear in the bottom right hand corner of my Firefox browser with no apparent way of removing them. MalwareBytes, nor Kaspersky could find any trace of what appeared to be malware installed. Finally, I figured out on my own what had happened, though not how to permanently reverse what evil they had done.
Apparently they use a combination of cookies to track your movements on the web that transmits this information back to one of their servers that pushes ads over top of the page you are viewing. The use of a push server makes trying to find them a bit of a chore, they have also added keys in the Windows registry so that deleting and reinstalling Firefox will do no good. The only way I found to stop this nonsense was to do the following ...
1. Go to the three bars just under the red exit button at the upper right of the Firefox browser. Select ""Options"", on the left side menu, go to ""Content"". The third category down will be ""Pop-ups"", click the ""Exceptions"" button and in the dialog box that appears, delete any and all site URLs that have ""tomshardware"" in them.
2. Download AdwCleaner from MalwareBytes and install. Don't trust any third party sites, just go and install it and run a scan. It will find the crap in the Windows registry and in your AppData folder where the lowlifes from Tom's installed keys to ""phone home"". Delete these (AdwCleaner will do this for you).
3. Now we've eliminated the Tom's push server from the equation, unfortunately for us though the scumbags at Tom's have opened the door for other push servers (including this site) to interrupt our enjoyment of the web. That is where AdBlocker Ultimate (free) comes in. It is available via the ""Add-ons"", accessible in the same menu I refer to in step 1 to get to the ""Options"" in Firefox. Be forewarned, there are several add-ons that purport to block ads, the most prominent being ""Ad Blocker"", which is nothing more that a trojan that actually allows certain ads to always get through. Thank God I looked at the number of users, user reviews and the stellar rating the software had before installing.
It appears the popups are dead for the time being. As for Tom's Hardware, not only was the information that I was looking for bogus (clickbate?), but in Googling a fix for this problem guess what URL appears in over 3/4 of the ""how to fix"" links ... Tom's Hardware. The most often seen response, ""Well you clicked on it!"" Way to go you pond scum.
UPDATE: A few added notes to fix your Firefox browser. Clear any and all cookies with ""ad"" in the name (or for that matter, any you don't immediately recognize), and of course the ""tomshardware"" cookie(s). Just don't delete the ones for sites you regularly log in to. I also found the door they kicked open in my browser and how to close it, courtesy of ""jscher2000"".
There are two different preferences for notifications, a master switch, and one which is specific to background (web push) notifications that can appear after you leave the site which sends them.
(1) In a new tab, type or paste ""about:config"" in the address bar and press Enter/Return. Click the button promising to be careful.
(2) In the search box above the list, type or paste ""webno"" and pause while the list is filtered.
(3) To disable PUSH NOTIFICATIONS, double-click the ""dom.webnotifications.serviceworker"".enabled preference to switch its value from true to false -- sites can still generate desktop notifications while you have a tab open to the site.
(4) To disable ALL NOTIFICATIONS, double-click the ""dom.webnotifications.enabled"" preference to switch its value from true to false -- this is a master switch, you won't get any desktop notifications from any sites."
1444,2,"I'm currently waiting for an impulse purchase on an incense burner for $50. It's now been two weeks and I still have no idea when I'll actually get it cause it's coming from CHINA!!! Not only did I see it requires a specific ""down flow"" incense cone that I also have to order on line. I found out I could have gotten the exact same product from Amazon in 3 days at half the price! What a dope I am!!! I was going to order a cool lamp from Uplift but after this experience I'm deleting my bookmark on this business."
1445,1,"WORST COMPANY EVER!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS. All items are shipped out of China after the order is placed. 34 days it took to receive and they ignored my emails the whole time as I tried to figure out what was going on. I asked 3 times for the order to be canceled and refunded if it had not yet shipped and was ignored each time. Please save yourself the hassle and DO NOT ORDER FROM inpire uplift. They say 1-3 days processing and 7-10 days shipping. They weren't even close yet now they only want to offer me store credit (after FINALLY getting back to me). Website says 100% satisfaction guarantee which is not at all true. I would never consider buying anything from these people again. All this stuff can be found online cheaper and with much better shipping and customer service. I have never had a worse experience buying ANYTHING EVER online. Trust me, you do not want to get involved with this company."
1446,3,"I am extremely disappointed with this company. I watched the video advertisement on pinterest for the car cleaning product and was impressed. Nowhere in the video or the literature anywhere was there shown to be or said to be the need to hook the tool itself up to an air compressor. The tool will not work without one. Furthermore, I reached out for a refund about this problem, and I received no response."
1447,2,"There are abundant places where adults can go online to be alone with content. What was rare and is now rarer still are places where adults can go safely online with adult content in a community setting. Tumbl abandoned the vast number of users who helped make it a worthy brand in December of 2018 when they decided to restyle themselves as morality police. I'll never log in again, but I'm not deleting my account, just so they'll know whom they're NOT reaching now."
1448,2,"I've had a Tumblr blog since 2010. Things used to be great and then the Russian bot accounts (some with porn, some without) that spammed tags made things crazy for a while. It's settled down, but since December 2018 when they started flagging posts for ""adult content"" it's gone completely around the bend. I have a blog dedicated to an old sci-fi TV show. I make a lot of photo posts, which are completely SFW. Tumblr would flag more than half of them as ""adult content."" I'd appeal them and they'd get reinstated, but it was very tiring to go slogging through all these posts and have to appeal them. I contacted Support countless times and they were useless. Going through my blog's archive, I recently discovered that posts I'd made 1-2 years ago had been marked as ""possible adult content"" and were hidden from the public. Clicking on the actual posts came up with ""URL not found"", meaning they deleted them (below are photos showing what happened). I was never even notified of this. Angrily contacted Support, got their useless ""Zendesk"" bot with a totally irrelevant reply. I'm just disgusted they've deleted totally innocent, SFW posts without notifying me. In recent days they've laid off flagging my new posts but I'm nearly done with them. I've backed up my blog to Wordpress and will continue updating there. Thanks for turning what was once an enjoyable experience into a nightmare, Tumblr."
1449,2,"It used to be a site where you can be free with your art and your interests but it's turned into a place now where they have a censoring bot that goes around censoring nipples basically or anything that looks ""seductive"" and not well either. There was an outbreak of porn bots, which btw ARE STILL VERY MUCH ACTIVE, and that was the reason tumblr wanted to implement this, but they went about it the completely wrong way. They are going against everything they stood for and i honestly am done with the grieving of this site. It has been long overdue that tumblr would die just like myspace and every other trash social media site that started out well and just collapsed due to bad decisions."
1450,2,"We signed up for multiple products (a yr ago) all on automatic draft and free shipping for every order. Fine at first, then they started charging shipping. We called amd couldnt get anybody on the phone to help. We emailed and got apologies for the issue but nothing was done to fix it. We tried to cancel via email and phone message but cancellation was never processed. The only way to get anybody on the phone is when you wish to place an order. How convenient. So while we like numerous products, we cannot continue to do business like this. They owe us months worth of toothpaste that we never received and shipping costs but they wont fix the issues."
1451,2,The worst customer service ever. By the way if you have extra inventory (and ours was expired too when we got it) do not try and sell it on ebay - they do not warn you about this if you are new to ebay they will ding your ebay account with a copyright violation with no warning. So if you have been a great Alex supporter it will not matter. They do not care. We will never support infowars in any way shape or form again.
1452,1,"Alex Jones espouses unsubstantiated claims and general quackery, amidst his many false conspiracy theories and tin hat commentary. When he isn't screaming at his former wife for lawfully seeking custody of their children and disparaging her good name, he is making up lies about the Clintons or Obamas. He modeled a tin hat for his audience one. He should have kept it on his head. His website is a total waste of time and is not a reliable/credible source of information. Read that: Alex Jones is a liar."
1453,3,"Lately, every polite, evidence backed post I have made to this site concerning the gaping holes in the Russiagate narrative has been unceremoniously yanked for no good reason. When anther poster questioned why some of these comments were being blocked (usually within an hour of posting them), the moderators denied doing so. This is censorship at it's worst. The Kos is engaged in a deliberate and wholesale deceit of it's own readership and ought to be called to account for the very same Stalinist behaviour indulged in by Trump and his fake news warriors. They are using their platform in social media for the purposes of suppressing dissent and manipulating facts. There ought to be somewhere to go to complain about this."
1454,1,"I have no problem with ""slant"" per se on a website - all sites have them, you read them or you don't - but the problem with DailyKos isn't slant. It's the site's proto-fascism in demanding absolute adherence to a particular set of ideas (and as a prof of political science I don't use the term ""fascism"" lightly). DailyKos says it doesn't remove posts, but it does worse - it gives ""trusted"" users complete power to flag and censor comments, and it takes just two such flags to remove your comment. This means that no deviation from what these users consider the ""correct"" one, even a ""friendly amendment,"" is allowed. As a result of this abdication of responsibility by the editors, a few narrow-minded ideologues are free to act as gatekeepers to stifle democratic discussion. I discovered this the hard way: like another person commenting here, I offered my firsts comment (polite, no unprofessional language, just calling for caution on the Russia question) and was promptly trashed and insulted by a string of childish nasty responses calling me a bot, a ""kamikazi drone strike,"" etc. Worse, the very first reply ""flagged"" my comment for deletion and it was then ""hidden"" along with the nasty replies so my point was effectively censored. As someone who is regularly trashed for being too ""liberal"" I found this astounding! All a reader has to do to remove a view s/he doesn't like is flag it? How convenient! And my effort to reach the editors to protest came to nothing. Aside from the damage to any democratic ethos, DailyKos only reinforces stereotypes about progressive politics rather than breaking them down. I've found some info from its mail lists useful, which I'll miss, but I don't think this kind of nasty groupthink should be encouraged so I will unsubscribe and encourage others to do the same."
1455,1,"I wrote a comment about an article with a differing opinion than those that had been previously posted, was accused and threatened as a ""troll"", and was blocked.
Many of the comments following this article promoted an agenda of hate and violence towards those who didn't agree.
Previously,I had found the articles posted to be well put viewpoints, but If you don't promote their agenda, you are not allowed to participate. To me this perpetuates the ""us vs them"" mentality that they rail against. It certainly is NOT an unbiased forum, and promotes hate speech."
1456,1,"This is nothing but a disgusting propaganda site filled with anti-Israeli and pro Russian garbage. Pull this stinking trash pile up alongside Russia Today, notice the identical web architecture, shared stories,and articles on VT that site the crap from RT as source and take 3 guesses who really runs this site. If any actual American veteran believes anything posted inthis garbage dump I would be shocked."
1457,1,"""Veterans Today"" is ALARMIST TRIPE. It's designed to flip the polarity on the American political establishment by exposing them as sub-human and barbaric creatures. Yet, the childish caricatures painted about the Clintons, Bushes, and other political leaders are simply unbelievable and, in the end, laughable. ""Veterans Today"" is alarmist cartoon journalism living in the valley of defecation."
1458,1,"This site copies and pastes a few legitimate articles of interest to veterans or their families, in order to draw people in, and then fills the rest of the site with unfounded accusations and conspiracy theories against both the US government and its allies, and against Jews in general.
Most of the items they post have been thoroughly debunked elsewhere,but they continue to post it anyhow, which shows that their real interest is in stirring up hatred, not in spreading the truth."
1459,1,"It is impossible to contact buzzfeed. All the information they have regarding my company, including the name, is incorrect, yet my efforts to correct it go unanswered. I will try again, by letter to their New York address, but I believe they are nothing but a crooked scam... A company (and I use that word loosely) like theirs need to make themselves available to their customers. Instead, they continue to post incorrect and false information about their clients. To say they are horrible is an understatement."
1460,3,"To be honest, I would politically identify as a Democrat/liberal/whatever you want to call me. A lot of these one star reviews for Buzzfeed come from the right, but I would like to represent my half of America when I say we hate them too. Don't have the mistaken belief that hating Buzzfeed is something only one party can do; it is as bipartisan as it gets. My reasons are the same as anyone else's on this site."
1461,1,Not an honest or accurate source of information. They have in the past and are currently misrepresenting the information. These people should be investigated for falsifying information and false truths. Possible legal suite would be appropriate to stop these websites that have so far escaped having to prove what they report.
1462,2,"i used to visit RT daily and comment on my faves often, always within the guidelines, as they have a reputation about being really stringent with the comment policy. i always comment on the story and don't attack other posters nor do i use profanity or hate speech, etc, however I would be blocked/banned usually weekly, i'd try again a few days later and be able to comment fine.
i reached out to MOD to ask why and I was first told I wasn't banned by RT, it was Disqus (which is BS b/c I was using Disqus to comment on other sites and was not banned or flagged for anything on Disqus). The last few times I was banned and sent an email to Mod with NO response. But a few days later I'd be able to comment. The final straw was sending an email about 2 weeks ago about why I was banned YET again and able to like posts but unable to comment, no response and no reversal. What a piece of crap site.. .they Don't deserve their following. PLEASE post other sites for discussing reality tv commentary with others.. would love to take my support and dialogue elsewhere. -Your Mama."
1463,1,"I have been banned twice now from Reality Tea for very innocuous and harmless comments. One of which stated that"" ""you will be banned from this site if you challenge or disagree in any way with any of the bloggers here."" I find it interesting that the bloggers, like Mary, can ridicule and make fun of Kim Richards, a person who suffers from alcoholism. Anyone suffering from this debilitating and often deadly disease does not deserve to be ridiculed and made fun of, but yet this is what Reality tea allows on a daily basis. The vile comments these bloggers make about people is truly hideous, but don't you dare call them out on their B.S. Stay away if you know what is good for your soul and may they rot in hell."
1464,1,"Reality Tea will block you in a New York second if it's not the ""company line"" which means there are around 9 commenters on the thread who rule as long as they follow the likes of the RT writers. God forbid if you disagree with a writer's position! If you do, you will be BANNED. You will never receive an explanation! But if you should comment again, a BIG RED BANNED will pounce on you.
You will never be told the specifics of WHY YOU WERE BANNED. That message will just pop up!

1465,1,"As others are starting to experience in the past 2 weeks, I too, have been a victim to this ""very real"" website, low4price.com. After my husband lost his job early Nov. I started looking for a way to supplement our income, and planned to retail the zhu zhu's on ebay. I invented far more than I care to share, but like others, had a delayed shipment, and when it arrived, my supposed pcs. were 10 pcs. of plastic. I spoke with them on instant chat immediately and was told that ""I am sure it will be tommorrow then"" when I went as far as photographing the product that arrived, the shipping label, and a pic of our instant chat and emailed it to ""LUCAS"" I was asked to give them a couple of days to check with their shipping provider, and wearhouse to see what may have gone wrong. I have made email attempts 3 times since then and am receiving no feedback. The webpage appears to be shutdown. This is one of the sickest scams I have seen. Your payment is requested Western Union, cash only. They have taken my money and ran and I am sick to death. Like the father and son with the birthday investment with them, this was my children's Christmas. Please stay away. I had investigated all possible means of them being legit, and they fit the credentials somehow. BUT, they are not trustworthy and will take your money I am afraid to say."
1466,3,I ordered every Zhuzhu pet and accessory available. I was so excited to give them to my grandchildren for Christmas. I got a tracking number and was notified when it got to my local post office. I received no Zhuzhu pet anything. What I did receive was a Yves St. Laurent pair of black patentleather stiletto shoes size 38. If anyone out there got my toys and not their shoes please respond via this website. Maybe we can arrange an exchange. I did contact low4price via email. They said they would contact their shipping dept. That was 3 days ago and no response since. I am still holding out some hope but we'll see.

I had to complete a fraud form with western union, the fbi and the police. THEY ARE NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF THIEVES that hopefully will get theirs. My son is sooo upset, and I am to blame for not being more cautious. I Now have to reimburse him his money to purchase a new one and it is double the loss AT THIS TIME OF YEAR. Hopefully everyone who has dealt with them will make enough complaints. I feel for all that have lost money to these DISGUSTING COLD HEARTED CRIMINALS."

After that as I was trying to get a E Reader that sooted as the first to also were no good. Still looking but not anymore.So the other week I went to go over to site & had problems so deceide to put as Favorite as I believed that would solve it. Big joke when I went to try & sign in no go as I was trying to go through all options I came across this & after reading I have deceided I will except it as is & give it a miss. Lesson learnt. I do have to say they go to big efforts imagine the money they pull, still doesn't mean it Whright I would rather be broke & sleep well I wonder if they do. Zowie phillips."
1469,1,"The site is definitely misleading. The first clue is that it claims to offer current bestsellers for free and does not directly explain how copyrights are respected. Out of fairness to the authors' intellectual property, we should avoid any site that can't explain that key point. Amazon offers specials and free books that surely comply with legal requirements and I'vegotten several from them."

I read what they were ""selling"" and decided to see if anyone else had anything to say about it.

They tell me they faxed the Rx already but they would do it again to make sure they received it. I hang up with the vet and call Allivet to tell them. The woman I spoke to said that now there were 2 orders being filled, so I had her cancel the second one since she assured me that the first one was already shipped. I get an email confirming shipment and giving me a tracking number that I try to access but can't. I give it about a week and call them. The gentleman I spoke with tried to track it and couldn't find it either even though my account was showing that the order was completed. So, he says he will resend the order overnight AND give me a $10 coupon on my account to use the next time. Four days go by and still no order, but I get another email saying that per our conversation, here are the directions to send the prescription!!! So, I call again, the rep says to ignore that and that they were emailing the pharmacist to let him know the situation and to just send it out. Two hours later I get a call from the pharmacist asking me for the prescription!! I then flip out on him, explain the whole story again, and he reassured me that the order will be sent and I'll get it the next day. The next day I get an email saying my shipment has been put on hold while they wait for the prescription, but I ignore it because of being assured by the pharmacist that the order was being filled. Same morning I get a call from the same guy that had first told me that he would next day the order and give me a coupon...they are now saying that my only orders were from the year before and the one that I just cancelled, even though I gave them ALL of the order numbers including the one from 3/14/19 that shows that it's completed. I tell him that if I don't have my order by the next day, that I will not do business with them any longer. He assured me that he is putting the order through and I'll have it the next day. A few hours later I get a call from their ""customer escalation"" department and I have to explain the WHOLE story again because she is insisting that I cancelled the order. Now, this is how she is going to resolve it for me: send me the two boxes with a discount of $3 on each and not charge me the $22 next day shipping! Making my order total $63 when my original order was only $58 with free standard shipping!! Doesn't even offer the $10 coupon that's supposed to be on my account!! Of course I flipped out on her and said goodbye after assuring her that I'll never do business with them again!!"
1472,3,"Yes, they have good prices, but if you want to wait to your meds for 2 weeks, order from them. And during this 2 weeks you have to call every day to check out on your meds, otherwise you might not get it at all. They keep lieing saying that order has been shipped, but it hasant. They lies about day and time your doctor send proscription and blaim doctor office for the delay, not them! . I have used alivet for a few times and each time it getting worse and worse. Better pay extra buck or two, but know that you get your meds on time."
1473,1,"Save your time and frustration; go to your vet and get your medicine. You will get an email daily stating that they have contacted your vet and to speed up the process to call your vet and have them contact them. After getting the 3rd one, I realized that they are just sending emails. My vet is excellent and prompt. If this company picked up the phone to make some money, they might actually stay in business. NOTE TO OTHERS, most vets will price match. So just print their prices and take them to your vet. Save yourself A LOT of hassle."

In addition we could hardly open the container!"

They even go so far as to say they have as many as 20 of that item. They will take your money VERY QUICKLY and THEN come back and tell you that they must try to get the item from another supplier. In short, they are NOT in possession of the image they are selling. BUYER BEWARE!!! They will take your money and leave you with zilch."
1476,1,I ordered four Seresto collar's and four boxes of heart guard plus from Valleyvet.com. One of my dogs had a terrible reaction with the Seresto collar and two of my other dogs became very sick after taking the heart guard plus. To date it has cost me $1800 in vet bills. When I called Valley vet to tell them about the heart guard plus they told me there was nothing they could do about it and they would not let me return the unused boxes of Heartgard Plus or the Seresto collar's. Before I placed my order I had spoken to two individuals at Valley vet.com and I asked them where they got their products from. I was told it comes directly from the manufacturer. After my dogs became ill from taking the heart guard plus I contacted the Merial company that makes it and they said that they do not distribute any of their merchandise to Valley vet.com. I was totally lied to by Valleyvet.com!!! On top of that my dogs became very ill from their products and it has cost me a ton of money in vet bills and my dogs are still not well!!! A good company would stand behind the products that they sell Valley vet does not stand behind their products!!! Stay away from this company!!!!!!!
1477,2,"The stores won't sell canned pet food by the case which means a higher cost per can. When I've ordered online to get the case price, they often sent loose cans instead of factory sealed cases. On two of my last three auto-ship orders, this resulted in my receiving the wrong items. Whoever is packing these boxes isn't paying attention to which cans they're grabbing. While they do ship quickly, I can't depend on them to send me what I ordered so I'll be doing all my buying with Chewy for now."

I recently placed my order and selected standard shipping 4-5 business days. After 4-5 business days I didn't receive the medication. After checking their website, it said I wouldn't receive it for another WEEK! We've run out of the medication and now my dog is getting sick. My vet is at Banfield Veterinary Hospital located within Petco. How much easier could this be?! The Petco website customer representative wasn't willing to take any measures beyond taking a 2nd order and charging me for expedited shipment. Not willing to contact the vet directly to speed up approval and shipping of the medication. Also, not willing to credit me for extra shipping costs. The 2nd order is only going to arrive a day earlier than the original order. But with my dog getting sick I'll take that extra day at the very least. I don't have an issue with Banfield or my vet - they are great! I would highly encourage people to find another supplier for your pets medication! If you are concerned about reliable service, shipping delivery as promised and your pet's health avoid Fosters & Smith/ Petco for your beloved pet's medication!"
1479,2,"They have right at the top of their online page, ""$49, free shipping."" There is no asterisk or small writing after it, no exclusions whatsoever. You have to click on the ""free shipping"" line in order to see that there are exclusions, but there is no indication that it is even a link or clickable.
However, after you fill out your order and all the information, you will not get free shipping unless it is on specific products. They are PURPOSELY hoping their customers add more products in order to get free shipping and then are too dumb to notice they're charging a shipping fee.
I had to EMAIL customer service to find out that there are exclusions. That's how hidden it is. They were totally unapologetic. They've lost me as a long-time customer."
1480,2,"We live across town in Ypsilanti Township and were just having one of those "" running sorta behind days"". We've NEVER been late for any other appointments with Pet Smart in the past. I called ahead, letting them know we'd be 15 minutes behind. Although, it was 10 minutes longer, pass their so called grace period. Upon arrival, we were told they could not groom our (23 lb.) Dog because we were late! Kimberly, acted like she didn't care at all that we were displeased! My dog has come home with burn marks from the razor, bleeding toenails from too short nail clips, itchy from not rinsing the shampoo out good....But we showed patience, giving Pet Smart a chance to remedy their inadequacies. Where is Pet Smarts patience toward Loyal Customers who may be running slightly behind on a particular day?? DEFINATELY WILL NOT use them ever for Boarding my dog or Grooming him again!"
1481,2,In the last five months I I have had to replace my bearded dragons basking bulb about 7 times. The bulb I use keeps going out and it's not my fixture I just got a new one because I thought it was a fixture. It's ridiculous having to buy a new bulb every month when it should be every 6 months to 7 months. And any time I go in there to replace the bulb they get nasty with me. I'm pretty sure I will be going to paw Mart near me. They are better at customer service.
1482,3,"On August 22nd, 2018 I went to a PetSmart for a male Cavia Porcellus (derogatory referred to as ""Guinea Pigs"" but I am going to refer to them as Cavia Porcellus or just Cavia) he is alive and growing.
But on November 10th, 2018 at Stemmons Lewisville I went for a female Cavia. I named her Cinnamon as she resembled others I had years before also named Cinnamon. She even behaved identically to them, as if she recognized me even before we met.
Unfortunately, Cinnamon has DIED did not even live much longer than TWO MONTHS.
I have decades experience in raising Cavias and have never encountered this before. Meaning that every Cavia from a Pet Shop had lived for 5, some times 6 years. I must have a replacement, even though I hate the word replacement with no restrictions on location, date, and time. and must replaced with a healthy Cavia."
1483,1,"Do not use this company. Like many others have posted, they just want your money. My sweet fur baby was missing for 6 days. Got a random text from a number about the service which we jumped on given the situation only to find out it was a scam. I emailed requesting a possible refund and was told they were going to report me to local authorities for making a false claim as it's illegal. I contacted again but got no response (probably because I called them out on trying to scare me). 2 days later I emailed again as I never got the follow up email with login instructions from the first transaction. Never got a response but got an email stating I forgot to attach a picture (only sign up for call alerts not poster). Emailed and got no response. They don't do a darn thing put play on people's emotional distress."
1484,1,"On a Sunday in December 2018, I paid about $110 for 500 calls and 50 or so flyers / faxes concerning my lost cat. I was still in the process of trying to get help from their customer service (I had to leave a message with an answering service) to get photos uploaded when we got a tip and foundour kitty. I knew I had agreed to their no refund policy, but since the company had not started any of the work, I sent and email politely asking them to consider a partial refund. I have never received a reply to the email nor did I ever receive a call back from the message I left. I emailed them again from my work email complaining at this point about the lack of a response. I received two responses. The first said I would get a full refund and the second accused me of not reading their policy. Again, no one acknowledged the original request for a partial refund. Regardless, I never received the full refund that was promised. I emailed again after the holidays and as of today (Jan. 10) have received no response. The email responses I did receive were curt (at best) and without any professional logos, signatures lines, etc. I believe this company to be a complete fraud that preys on people who are desperate to find a lost pet and pay for their service out of desperation."
1485,3,"I have left 3 mesg with their "" Messenger Service"" which quite frankly sounds like some guy sitting at his kitchen table. Everyday I'm told that there in meetings. No one is ever called me back. I was sent one automated message that at the end said if I pressed one I could talk to somebody but that didn't work. It just kept making the message repeat. I emailed them twice no response there either. They talked about how time is of the essence I don't even know if the Amber Alert ever went out. I honestly don't think it did because none of my neighbors got it. I wouldn't dare ask for my money back because one of the stipulations is this big long agreement that you will not ask for your money back and it repeats that over and over in the agreement now I know why they have it in there and are so adamant about it. And I just keep remembering having them repeat time is of the essence it's so important you're at a time frame and I can't even get anyone to answer my phone calls questions call me back and I honestly like I said don't think they even sent the Amber Alert out. They sent me one email that said exactly zero Flyers went out to local businesses. Okay thank you for telling me what you didn't do. What I do want is my money back but you not allowed to ask him for that the whole thing seems like a scam. I highly doubt they have that many meetings and even if they did they should have somebody available to speak to people since time is of the essence and they sure don't have a problem taking your money and sending you emails telling you how it really help if you upgrade."
1486,2,"Logged into my account selected the products I wanted there was a promotion listed I selected it. Assuming if it was offered in my account I could use it yup it applied processed my payment done great easy right? No I think not I get an email an hour later saying the coupon offered and applied is not available for my account they went ahead and charged my card for the difference without permission. And after several emails not one single person can tell me.
Why.
A customer logs in to their account.
Purchases items with their account.
Applies a coupon code that was offered in the customers account.
Checks out pays the amount that is shown the discount has been applied.
Then gets an email saying yea you can't have that coupon your choice is pay difference (which they charged without permission anyway) or cancel account.
If a coupon isn't applicable on and account why does it show up why does it get applied false advertisement and customer service that is lacking any kind of service. This was last straw with chewy I will be buying on amazon same prices!!!!"
1487,2,"I have been using chewy for awhile now. I am always recommending them to others. Usually I am very pleased with them. I have a very fussy 12 year old shih tzu. In the past they have been good about crediting me back and telling me to keep the item. This past call I spoke with Talia. She was rudefrom the start and said I had to send the item back. I would have to print label, find a box to put item in and then contact fed x to pick up. What is the sense of that as they can't resell it. When I asked about it she said they had to inspect the item. The treats were very moist and didn't have a moisture pack in it so I put it in a different bag. Therefore it wasn't in the original bag. Explained my dog wouldn't eat them. I will not be ordering from them anymore or suggesting them to others."
1488,3,"Just tried chewy for first time. Ordered large amount of items at same time. Shipped out in two boxes which were suppose to arrive by end of same day, one arrived , but other went out to another state! Now my pets are out of food - have to go to store which defeats the purpose of using this store. What a waste !"
1489,3,"Over priced, small pours, terrible music. Nice look. Difficult to locate the door - lot of time wasted just trying to get in. WONDERFUL people working there, seemingly nice clientele.
I am a New Yorker who visited Montreal with my GF for several days last week.  We are regulars at many speakeasies and bars in Manhattan and Brooklyn and I am a big fan of the Toronto Temperance Society in Toronto.  We were recommended to check out  the Cold Room while in MTL.  Honestly, I think my TLDR above kind of says it all.  The staff were WONDERFUL (once we managed to get inside).  I would say the real issue was the terrible music.  One does not play BLUES or easy listening pop (I consider the Beatles easy listening pop)  in a speakeasy.  Well, I guess they do in MTL, but we found it a major turn off. The drinks were ok - kind of small but not bad tasting.  We were not bowled over by the creativity of the cocktail menu.  ... I'm sorry to sound like a carper but basically we felt that this place is highly overrated.  Change the music, be a little more generous with the pours.. and get rid of the merch .. (what real speakeasy sells merchandise with their logo on it?)  and maybe that would improve things.  We're unlikely to return."
1490,1,I understand why they call this the cold room .  The reception is  cold if you are Not young and attractive.  The atmosphere is cold  and the drinks are so so .   do yourself a favor and go to any other cocktail bar other than this one !
1491,1,"If I had to explain this place to someone, I would say The Coldroom is equivalent to a sad steakhouse for drinks.  Absolutely anticlimactic.
I'm originally from Brooklyn, NY so I guess that means my standards are a lot higher for a place that specializes in making good cocktails.
The Dead Rabbit, Members Only, Angel's Share, Death & Co., etc. in NYC are all great, but this place was a huge let down.
The crowd that comes in here is pretty much what I would call ""bridge and tunnel"" people, which basically means a whole lot of American tourists that look like they are from New Jersey, Long Island, and Staten Island covet this place - just a bunch of basic humans.
The cocktails aren't even creative - nothing about these drinks are wow.  They are pretty basic and there isn't any experimentation with the ingredients or flavors except for the Almond Milk Punch - exactly what I ordered.  The cocktail list didn't encourage me to order anything else.  So, I guess having us wait for 30 minutes to get in on a Friday night was fairly ridiculous when the drinks sucked.
All the hype, mediocre drinks, and ambiance reminds me of a very masculine steakhouse where you're able to order a steak well-done without receiving weird stares ... and if I might add, they play AWFUL music.  This place tries to be ""hip"", but honestly, I don't see anything ""hip"" about it.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by NYC.
Overall, I would say this place is BASIC.  The Basic B**** of cocktail spots in Montreal."
1492,2,"I had a bad experience there last night.  I was refused service due to the bartender claiming that I looked impaired.  In fact I was sober, having drank 2 beers earlier in the night, and even he admitted that I sounded fine, but he said my eyes looked red (I checked in the mirror later, they may have had a slight redness to them but nothing noticeable).  Even after the bouncer told the bartender that we had just had a 30 minute conversation while waiting in line, and that I was not impaired, he refused to serve me.  I don't know if he was just in a bad mood, or if there was some discrimination due to the language I was speaking (English) or my ethnicity/religion (it's easy to see from looking at me that I'm Jewish).  But I will never be going back to the Distillerie."
1493,3,"Unfortunately, we did not get to try anything here on our trip from nyc. The menu of cocktails looked great, the environment looked fun and everyone else seemed to be enjoying themselves. We were told to wait outside a bit to get in and then were seated at a corner table. We then waited a good 10-15 minutes for service and I asked the man who seated us if it was bar service only or if someone would come to us. A few minutes later someone took our order and we again waited 15 minutes as the waiter tended to other tables. After about 30 minutes being there without a drink, we lost our enthusiasm for the place and left. On the way out the waiter gave me some attitude and I simply explained to him how long we weren't given service. He told me that it's a busy bar and that I should have expected this. This seems like an isolated incident based on how good the reviews are."
1494,3,"It's pretty dark, their drinks looked interesting. After about 20 minutes we got our drinks only to find out that they are 90% juice and bitters, 10 actual liquor. For $10 a drink that's pretty disappointing. After an hour I had to track down the server and ask for the check, this is of course after he brings three rounds of shots to the group next to us, and closes out two other tables. All in all, it's not worth the four and a half stars these people rate it. It's classy and cute, but ultimately disappointing.
But they did have jenga!"
1495,2,"Had dinner here tonight. Ordered the Cornish Hen for two and was told it would take 25 minutes. After 45 minutes the server came to tell us there was a discrepancy, apologized and he told us there would be just another 10 minute wait. He offered a free round of drinks (I'm 9 months pregnant) on our next round. My husband had already had 3 glasses of wine at this point and we assumed he would comp us one glass of wine and my $4 limeade. We didn't get dinner for another 25 minutes and when the bill came (also late) he didn't comp a glass of wine or my limeade. We loved the ambiance and the menu. When he told us there was a discrepancy we were still sure we'd be back but after offering a round of drinks (kind of a crappy offer for a pregnant girl) and didn't come through? We will most likely not be back."
1496,2,"So my friend was working hard since early morning at a bar nearby and a group of us go to have drinks and catch up during his shift. Someone comes up with the brilliant idea of Dominion Square Tavern deviled eggs and before you know it, 6 of us all of a sudden have the same craving.
They don't do delivery as they are a classy joint, which is fine, ok, but they do package up the remainders of your lunch or dinner, so they do have take away containers. We sent a friend over to sit at the bar, have a drink and then order some deviled eggs. He was going to eat a few and then bring the rest over to us. The waiter kiboshed that idea and said that we were breaking the take away rules. OK, you caught us, but given that a single deviled egg goes for 5$, you do the math: they just lost out on the easiest money they ever could have made on a quiet Sunday afternoon and instead left a lot of sad faced people deviled-eggless.
Most in the service industry bend over backwards to make customers happy and I really do not think that the integrity of the place would have been compromised by walking some leftover eggs 2 blocks away.
I see no reason to come back to this place given that the food is generally oversalted and the front hostess is almost always rude if you dare to show up sans reservation, even if the place is quiet. I want to love this place because the vibe and the décor are just plain awesome, but I cannot get over the hoity toity service and super rude hostess."
1497,2,"Not a good place for meeting up with friends.  My girlfriends and I came here for drinks and dinner the evening of the Habs Game 6 against the NY Rangers.  As soon as we got in we were seated since we had reservations.  We gave our drink orders and also ordered the charcuterie plate.  As we settled in and started chatting they kept trying to clean our drinks and plates the whole time we were there even when we were not finished yet.  We could not finish exchanging one story and they will pop up trying to clear our tables.  They seemed friendly about it but it was soooo annoying we settled our bill and left.
It is a nice place and the charcuterie plate was tasty but this place left a bad taste on my mouth.  Not returning here any time soon."
1498,2,It's really a shame when an interesting and intimately themed bar falls short due to rude and unprofessional staff. Walked into this bar over the weekend with a group of 7 and when we inquired about the menu we were spoken to with an attitude and sarcasm as if we were stupid to even have questions. Not only does the wait staff need to be retrained on hospitality but the management is 10x worse. I brought the rudeness up to the asian manager who was seating everyone and rather than address the issue and try to persuade us to stay he started making personal attacks on me and my group. Didn't even take a sip of the drinks because of how disgusting we were treated. If you can't take the criticism then get out of the world of hospitality and understand that word of mouth travels fast. Def would not visit this place again since customer service trumps all aspects for me. ZERO stars!!!!!
1499,1,"Came here this past weekend to celebrate a friends birthday. The ambiance is really great but that's about it. The drinks were terrible and overpriced. The staff was unfriendly and the manager was incredibly rude. To top it off, there was a cold breeze going through the bar as if they had left a back door open. So we were shivering the whole time as we drank our horrible $17 dollar drinks.
Avoid this pretentious bar at all costs. Spend your money and time elsewhere."
1500,1,"It seems like people have hit or miss experiences here and mine was a huge miss. The nice ambiance temporarily distracts from a staff that was incredibly rude, especially the manager. We were a big party (7 people) so they had to split us up, no problem as we only wanted to pop in for a drink anyway. When the last of us made it in I tried to walk around for a second to see where the others were sitting and I was properly scolded and asked to sit down, being told sharply ""we let you know you wouldn't all be together"".  The cocktails were substandard but mostly drinkable. One friend didn't like her drink at all and when inquiring what could be done about it the manager got straight up aggressive and accusatory. My jaw literally dropped I'd never been treated this poorly for simply communicating that we didn't like something. The manager must own this place? That's the only way I can imagine he's able to get away with this type of behavior. Beware!"
1501,2,This was always a staple during our trips to Montreal however this last visit changed that. My companion asked for a red ale the bar tender informed us that all beers were grouped as pale ales and they did not carry any dark ales. Not the most helpful service needless to say we won't be back.
1502,3,"The Bier mart is nice but very loud sports pub . The hostess is rude and very unprofessional. They do not honour reservations and basically do not care !!!
We sat upstairs in the corner where the lightbulb  was burnt out on bar stools. It took the waitress 15 mins to come to our table to see if we wanted drinks or to order food..
We order a small house salad to start with -that was served  to our table 15 mins after our meal. Hello it is a starter not and ender.
I  ordered the large pot of mussels in beer with bacon. The mussels were dry and over cooked and there was a little bit of broth found in the bottom of the pot. The stale bread was not able to soak up the salty broth, the order came with a small order of fries for kids  which were not hot. You think they could afford to serve a proper size of fries.
My spouse ordered the grilled chicken sandwich which was over cooked and came with cold fries.
The waitress never came back to check on us until the end of the meal 15 mins later with the salad. Save your money and what a disappointment the waitress was nice but the service and the food is terrible This was a sure miss and was very disappointed in both the food, service and attitude.
Clearly the waitress did care and did nothing to what we said about the meal being over cook and was sure disappointing meal. Sorry to post a bad review but had to be honest !!!"
1503,3,"Well if you like over priced beer this is the place . The Bier mart is nice but very loud sports pub . The  2 male hostess were rude and very unprofessional. They could not find our reservation at first and when they did they sat us upstairs in the corner where the lightbulb  was burnt out on bar stools. It took the waitress 15 mins to come to our table to see if we wanted drinks or to order food. Save your money and what a disappointment the waitress was nice but the service and the food is terrible.

You think for $20 they could afford to give a proper order size of fries. The waitress never came back to check on us until the end of the meal 15 mins later with the salad. This was a sure miss and was very disappointed in both the food, service and attitude.
Clearly the waitress nor management cared when we said this was sure disappointing."
1504,3,"Very heavy food, they have authentic dishes which sounds interesting but they are laking in taste. The staff was very rude to us, my friend has severe dairy allergies and we told the server that she cant have any butter, dairy, etc  then he brought her dish with slices of bread covered with butter all over that was dripping on her dish, once we realized its butter we asked him about it. he didn't apologize he told her that she shouldn't eat out if her allergies are that bad! We've been out eating for years and never heard such rude comment, I hope he'll learn to be more careful and to respect the customers!"
1505,3,Very good food. But get ready for a TERRIBLE service. Asked for menu they forgot to bring. Called the waiters twice they forgot to show up. They forgot orders and the place was half packed. Disgusting service.employees def need a training. Food was 7/10 though.
1506,2,"I went there for the first time with my friends to have a Sunday brunch (I suggested this place). The food quality was great, however the portion for a brunch was not sufficient and there is not enough bread alongside with your meal (everything is paid and not bundled with the meal. Extra bread, coffee, etc.)
Although we were a bit disappointed with the portion and all, we enjoyed the atmosphere. Unfortunately, at the end the waiter impolitely raised his voice about tipping (although we gave him tip, but he complained.) He has to know tipping is a privilege, not an obligation, and if someone is totally happy will give more tip. We were not totally satisfied with the service.
Not going there for a second time because of being treated this way in front of my friends and other people. Literally our Sunday mood turned down because of this."
1507,1,"Very poor service, we had to wait 15 min to get a drink and order. Lots of drunk young people at 2pm. Loud music, so loud, that the waitress had to ask as several times to get the order. By the way, when we get their music was not that loud, it was turned on because few drunk guys were very exited and asked for it. So the bar guy did not care about other visitors and turned it on. Food is poor, service is poor. I am not recommending to go their, unless you are 18 and it is does not matter what to eat and what to drink. Cheep place for very young immature kids."
1508,1,"Only go there if your budget is very very low. Waitresses are always really nice but come see you once every 40 minutes -- so does our meal... One time tho, when asking for an update on our meal, my waitress gave me a bitchy look and told me we only ordered 15 minutes ago (which isn't true at all) and gave me the worst service afterwards. I'm not the type of person to complain and I've been there a lot and I'm used to noisy place, but this place is next level noisy. Have to yell to talk to someone just in front of me, can't even hear myself think. Worst ambiance to eat... No water refill most of the time, people jumping on tables and bar... Singing (yelling!) in our ears... I get that this must be an exciting place to work but please be respectful of other people around, you're still in a restaurant and serving people to eat not in a trashy club/karaoke...
Like I said, don't go there except if your wallet REALLY can't afford somewhere cheaper...
Food is okay for the price, not amazing but again okay for small wallets. Be ready to wait a lot!"
1509,3,"Exceptionally bad service, but good food and drinks. We know it's busy and all, but the waitress took extremely long between everything: giving us our menus, taking our order, giving us our drinks, receiving our food (which they got wrong), getting the bill, coming to make us pay... They really are understaffed and don't seem to give much costumer satisfaction. The fact that the food is cheap shouldn't go hand in hand with bad service. Just don't come if you are hungry!
The food is decent though, and the drinks and music were good. Props to the bartenders, they were working extremely hard!"
1510,1,"Came here since it had reasonably positive reviews and thought this would be a great place to grab a quick beer and a hot dog. While sitting on the patio, a bug flew into my full glass of beer. I asked the server politely to replace my beer and instead he rudely stated he ""couldn't control the weather and perhaps we should sit inside"". If that wasn't bad enough, he stated he could remove the bug with a spoon and stated if I wanted another beer, I would have to pay for one. Shocked, I said sure I'll pay for another one. He then left the beer containing the bug sitting on our table for many minutes, and when he returned for with another beer, he once again asked if I wanted him to remove the bug with a spoon, to which I replied absolutely not. I asked another waiter if I could speak to the manager and he stated that my previous waiter was the manager. I then told him what occured and asked him if that is normal for them to offer to spoon bugs out of beer to which he nonchantly replied ""yes"". Absolutely disgusting. Do not come here if you expect good customer service, good food or even good beer. There are many other options in Montreal where you won't be expected by the wait staff to drink beers that contain bugs in them."
1511,2,"Good beers, but awful service. Went up to the bar to pay, and I told the bartender what I'd had. He thought I was ordering more and started to pour. I explained that no, I came to pay for what I ordered, not ordering more. Wow! He started yelling very loud very fast-it was shocking. People turned to look and my friend screamed at him, ""why are you yelling??"" I was so shocked I couldn't even find the words. Thankfully another bartender came and took him away, and apologized several times. It's not a bad place, but I will not be going back there."
1512,2,"sat outside and took forever to get waited on. whatever. didn't have the beers I wanted to try (anything IPA), but the ones we ended up getting were still pretty good. went inside to try to find someone to pay for our beers and the place is really cool looking, literally and figuratively. wouldn't go back. there are better, busier places. maybe I just prefer cozier pubs..."
1513,2,"I did not like this place.  Yes, the terrace is pretty, but the service is SO BAD.
First, they don't take debit or credit, which I know is the case in certain places but I think it's bad business.  Second, you have to pay for your drinks as they come to the table, which to me ruins the experience of having a night out and chatting with friends - I don't want to deal with money AS the drinks come.  Again, I know they're not the only place that does this but it really rubs me the wrong way.  The waitress took forever to come serve us. I wasn't really in the mood for alcohol so I asked for a diet coke, and she said they don't have anything diet. Huh?!
Then, I ordered some chicken wings and it took over an hour, and then this guy comes up to the table and hands me a styrofoam container in a paper bag with a receipt stapled to it. I was confused but then he explained he was the delivery guy - they don't make the food on the menu, they order it out, and then the other restaurant comes and delivers it! So now I'm tipping another restaurant delivery man for food I ordered here? To be fair, it did say that on the menu on the cover (which I didn't see until much later), but who reads the cover of the menu??
I found the whole place to just be ridiculous. On top of that, the drinks are expensive. Never again."
1514,3,"The terrace is cool, but the service was terrible.
Waitress was curt (borderline rude). We asked what beers they had, she stared blankly and listed a few styles. We chose IPA, but who knows from where. The second beer I ordered, she just never brought. And I don't think it was because we were Americans--two french-speaking UQAM students sat down at the next table and left after 20 minutes of no service.
This was the first place we went after driving in from Toronto (since we were staying at the lovely Angelica Blue B&B down the street) and we were worried this was how Montreal was going to treat our freedom-loving these-colors-don't-run boy-howdy American selves. Thankfully, this was not the case--we were respectful and friendly to every other establishment and were treated with absolute graciousness. Not here, though.
Neat spot, but get your act together."
1515,1,"Blond waitress denied me water in the patio area. Told me it would cost me money and it would have to be bottled, yet all around people had glasses of water. She said she was being nice to some people. I need to switch between water and alcohol or it makes me sick. This is ridiculous and I've been here for years. Hmm maybe it's because I'm ethnic. Damn racist waitress. I should have made sure I puked my face off and let them deal with the mess."
1516,2,"This was the worst experience I've had as a bar in Montreal. The bouncer/host talked down to us from the moment we walked in, but I tried to look past it. When we came in he told us there was standing room only, which was fine. It's a small space so it was pretty awkward, and we were waiting for a table to open up. The booths are big, public benches, and a nice couple who was sitting on the end of one got our attention and offered to move over so we could sit down, which we did. The same host came over shortly after and snapped ""You can't just come in here and shove people over."" I was shocked, having worked in a lot of restaurants, about being spoken to this way for absolutely no reason. We left right away, and as I was leaving I told him that I found what he said to be disrespectfully. He belligerently refused to acknowledge it, yelling things like ""How is that rude? Things like that happen 20 times a day. You're welcome to leave if you don't like it, it's not rude."" OK. Maybe this is just how they talk to people here, but I would recommend they hire someone who's not a sociopath to interact with customers. Definitely not going back."
1517,1,"I honestly have no idea how a place like this can get that many good reviews.
I sometimes wonder if the people here have any idea what a good cocktail is.
Because I can't believe we just got unlucky tonight.
I love cocktails. When I went back to Paris I was amazed to see a few amazing cocktails bars and I was so sad to leave, but in my mind I was hoping it would be ok, I would get good cocktails bars some place else. Well it's definitely not in Montreal that I'll have the chance to experience that again.
Because this one is supposed to be one of the best. And what do you get ?
A glass of ice with cinnamon flavoured water.
I seriously couldn't drink it. The ice glass came with three straws. I tried the three of them to hopefully get a taste of the cocktail and ... Nothing. I never thought I would ever have to suck so much on something.
Joke aside, I said to the waiter that I just couldn't drink it and he told me ""bring it to the bartender and ask him""
Maybe when he saw my face he decided it was his job to bring the drink back and try to do something about it.
So I don't really now what they did with it, changed the straws, add more water to it, I have no idea.
When I was finally able to drink it, it tastes like cinnamon water. And I'm not exaggerating.
My friend Karim came from Paris and I wanted to show him a good place. I was ashamed. Literally ashamed of what Montreal has to offer when it comes to cocktails.
This place is a joke.
I have no idea how it gets good reviews. Absolutely no ideas. But good for them I guess. Maybe I'm too picky.
Oh, if you're a fan of sucking hard to get cinnamon flavoured water : THIS IS THE PLACE"
1518,1,"Poor. The bar is small and the vibe is OK. I am a Montrealer, and there are much better options. The reason for my poor review, however, is the staff and the manager. We were a group of 4 and had to start a tab. A friend gave a credit card which was put aside. When it was time to pay, the credit card was nowhere to be found. Lost. The staff ignored us as they walked back and forth (for some reason never looking on the ground). The bar tender finally told us that the card was lost. No plan of action though (i.e. call us in the morning if it is found). She gets the manager (who is clearly very drunk) and he immediately says that it is an unfortunate situation but we have to pay for our drinks right now. There was, however, no credit card to pay this tab. We only ordered about 6 drinks for the group of 4 and the card holder only had one drink. There was never any offer to let the drink of the card holder go to make up for this unsettling incident (which I think would have been the best approach). Instead the drunk manager told the customer to shut up, and asked me to 'take this outside'. The staff was incredibly unprofessional and the drunk manager was really disrespectful and had no intention of assuming any responsibility whatsoever. We left as soon as he told us to shut up. Without paying (the other 3 were ready to pay if the manager had taken a second to calm down and process our payments). Don't go here, its really not worth it."
1519,1,"Was placed at a table at the door. Kept my jacket on because it felt colder then outside. Music was played LOUD. Couldn't understand the person sitting across from me. incomprehensibly low quality of food for a ridiculously high price.
Went there for brunch and left after one bite of the ""breakfast poutine"". lukewarm potatoes on the outside, hot on the inside of the bowl. supposedly there should have been meat in the poutine, but all i could find were it's cremated remains. After trying to find the meat i did discover a puddle of grease at the bottom of the bowl. That caused me to be full already.  Also got served a cold espresso :
After getting all of this, the hostess came by to ask us how everything was. We replied with ""bad"" and that we wanted the check. No question was asked about what was bad and no solution was offered to make it better.
We paid the ridiculously high bill and left.
We crossed the street to have a propper meal at Juliette & Chocolat."
1520,3,"After dropping a significant amount of money (multiple drinks, a tray of shots for our group and surrounding people, generous tips etc), a small unattractive 19 year old child who works at this establishment (who was off duty and drinking with friends), shoved a member of my party with all her strength to pass. He was irritated because it caused him to spill his drink and held his ground which in the end ended up moving her out of the way. She proceeded to shove him even harder, and then got one of the barmen to get the doorman and kick out group of 5 out of the bar while she laughed with her equally unattractive and immature friends. The barman who was serving us apologized (we'd been generous with him, and are a well off group in our late 20s early 30s). The barman who was in cahoots with this woman-child made an incredibly sexist statement to my friend by saying that she is a woman and is allowed to shove him, and also that she works here so she can do what she wants. This is unacceptable. I have been to this place multiple times, and have always enjoyed my evening, as well as spent a lot on drinks. She should not continue to work with the public if she is using her ""status"" as a bar waitress to be rude and obnoxious. The owner of this bar should realize that having such an employee is detrimental to their establishment and she shouldn't be allowed to interact with the public. Having worked in the public sector for many years, her attitude is not one I would accept as an owner or manager. Hopefully she will soon be out of a job, however if she isn't, she can continue her ""career"" cleaning up after bar patrons who have real jobs."
1521,2,"The first time I went to SuWu was in 2013. My initial impressions were that it had potential, but needed a lot of work with their service culture - one that values customers. I returned last night to discover that things had gotten worse. The people who work there are clearly biased towards people they know because they ignore everyone else. I have done a lot of traveling and this by far was the worst bar experience I've ever had. Getting a drink is next to impossible and believe me, I understand what bars are like on a busy night. Maybe if the bartenders weren't so concerned with making out with their boyfriends, dancing with their friends, singing along to some of the worst representation of ""hip hop"" I've heard, and getting drunk themselves they wouldn't have a bar full of clearly frustrated customers. However, to their advantage, the clientele is an average age of 18 and seem to have the memories of goldfish so they quickly forget about their bad experience. I'm sure the fact that most are already wasted helps too. It took 15 minutes to be acknowledged by a bartender. I order our drinks and proceed to watch her for another 10 minutes as she got distracted doing various things (everything, but making drinks) and then realize she forgot to serve me. Then the tap kicked so we had to wait another 15 minutes for that to be resolved, all for 3 beers. Because of the poor service, I wasn't planning on tipping, however that decision was taken from me as the bartender didn't return with my change. Granted it was only $3, but it was $3 I didn't want her to have. Overall, the service sucks here and maybe it could thrive if they replaced management and all staff. Lastly, hip hop is more than songs where every other word is a racial slur and lyrics that degrade women. I don't think whoever is in charge of music has any real knowledge of the genre and probably just played songs they heard on pop radio. I won't be returning."
1522,3,"Stopped here for a couple drinks before heading to another spot for dinner. Looked like a good crowd and it seemed like a happening little spot. Food and drinks were good but the service was terrible. We were visiting from Toronto for the weekend and our French is limited but the server seemed to be avoiding us at all costs and barely attempted to communicate with us. She actually came and cleared our food plates and didn't even ask if we wanted another drink (our glasses were clearly empty).
I get there may be some language differences but in any other situation I'd expect people to try to meet half way. In the service/hospitality industry I'd suggest staff should be going the extra mile to make their patrons feel welcome. Unfortunately we did not."
1523,3,"Came here while visiting Montreal from NY. The food was good and reasonably priced, but the service was terrible. Our French leaves much to be desired, but the waiter was very rude and did everything he could to ignore us. Very uncomfortable experience overall."
1524,3,"I came here for a book club, I loved the liveliness of this wine bar. This place is more of a tapas bar. The crowd was very casual- although there is a no reservation system, it took little time to get a table for 5. They had a wide wine selection- I was particularly intrigued  by the orange wine- interesting to the palette. I loved that you can assemble your own charcuterie plate- with half or full portions of meats, veggies, and cheese. The liver mousse really stood out for me. They also had main course options if you are craving something more hefty as a meal.
My single complaint was the lack quality service: Too many clients to few staff members= poor service. I don't even recall how many time we had to flag down our server to 1) get us more bread 2) get us more bread (at some point we are ready to grab it ourselves) 3) stop taking away the menus because we specified we would be ordering more food later 4) keep reminding our server of the wine i wanted 2 or 3 times.
Simple you have more customers- hire more staff to serve your customers! Would easily bump up the stars in my books if this was improved!"
1525,2,"I've been here twice and both times the service sucks. There are tons of staff everywhere, yet you always need to hunt your server down to order a drink. They don't check in on you nor make eye contact. I can get nice decor anywhere, but the service is what makes the difference. I'll be taking my business elsewhere."
1526,3,"I tried to go índice 2x different  times and truly got turned away because it was either closed to closing time or because the bar was closed.
Honestly, it was a profile age thing,I'm mid 50's and the crowd was young, mid 20's and early 30's, just rude. A 0 will be my rating."
1527,3,"I really wanted to like this place, but the service was horrible. I had maybe four or five different servers, all of whom didn't even remember to bring a glass of water when asked. When I paid, but was still sitting down, the manager came over quite upset because we hadn't tipped when we had paid with card. Listened to this aggressive speech about why the server deserved a tip... I usually leave a tip in cash once I leave a table, so seemed very excessive and unwelcoming. Absolutely ridiculous, and incredibly hostile."
1528,2,Tried to make an appointment and request a specific hairdresser and was told to find another salon. I'm for sure going to be doing that. This business does not need mine.
1529,2,"I had my hair cut done by Daniel as per the rave reviews here and I'm very disappointed with the result. Yes he is very nice, and so are his colleagues, but the end result was very ugly. I showed him a picture of what I wanted, and he made my hair look somewhere between a china doll and cleopatra. Rather than having beautiful bangs, I have an ugly box on my forehead, short and thick, and worst of all, it continues that way to the sides. I swear I could have cut my own bangs much better. Also, the haircut on the rest of the head was very amateurish. I was charged a whopping $70 for it all. I had to go straight to Sephora to pick up some hair products to tame this ugliness. Not coming back here, ciao!"
1530,3,"Mixed feelings. On one hand, the atmosphere is lovely, location convenient, and Daniel's technical skills are objectively excellent (I used to be a hairdresser, so I appreciate that). On the other hand, the haircut I got was not even close to what we agreed on. It took me years to grow my hair out, so the haircut being at least 3 inches too short is kind of a problem- think a bob sitting under the chin instead of softly layered below the shoulders cut. Full bangs are also something I didn't bargain for. My hair is wavy, and he haircut I got now requires a lot of product and styling to look good. Without styling it sadly looks like a frizz-bomb. I'm also quite upset that my hair clearly got washed with a sulfate shampoo, even though I stressed in the beginning that I had a keratin straightener in my hair. So that's a $300 anti-frizz keratin treatment gone in a blink on an eye, exacerbating the problem with styling my new haircut. The whole experience set me back $69 for cut and blow dry. A fair price in general. But, given that I got something that does not suit my lifestyle and that destroyed an expensive prior work, I can't really consider that a good deal. That said, the haircut itself is not bad and does suit my face- if I invest a lot of product and time into styling. Not sure how much good that is going to do with the upcoming fall winds and humidity though. I'm hoping the style will grow on me, but let's just say I'm not feeling it three days into the new 'do."
1531,2,"I had been searching for a good salon in Montreal for awhile. I checked several sites and many listed Aveda as one of the best. After reading reviews on Yelp I decided to make an appointment. I spoke to the receptionist, telling her I was not happy with my last couple of cuts/colors and wanted a senior colorist and stylist. They are significantly more expensive than the juniors/students. I wanted a balayage and a trim. Started with longer layers and blonde hair. After 4 hours and 300$ I walked out. Because of the loose curls in my hair, it looked ok. The cut and colour was not noticeable. After i got home and washed and blow dried it myself I noticed that it was COMPLETELY CROOKED. Like bottom layer is crooked. Random chunks are longer that the others. All the other layers are just randomly cut. I can't even explain it. I'm certain I could have done a better job doing it myself while drunk and blindfolded. The color is pretty blotchy but nothing compared to the cut. All in all, it's so bad that it's almost kind of funny. (That's how bad it is)I called and explained how bad it was and they offered me to return to my stylist to have her fix it. As if I want another hack job done. They told me that was the only option. So now I have to go to another salon and spend another God knows how much to fix it. Thanks aveda! Never again."
1532,2,"I went in for a blow dry and set and the hairdresser who did my hair, Anthony, kept commenting on my current haircut, saying it was uneven and he didn't like it. My godfather has been cutting hair since I was a little girl and is renowned in Toronto. Not only did Anthony not know what he was talking about, he didn't even blow dry my hair with a round brush. He kept asking me to come and see him to get my hair cut. Not impressed and will certainly not go back to this place. If your hairdressers are so desperate for new clients, you should let them know that this is a very tacky and rude way to try and get new ones."
1533,3,"At a McGill event, Aveda offers guests a free hair cut or treatment. I sign up, and get a call to confirm a bout 6 weeks in advance. In the weeks leading up to the scheduled appointment, I get 3 followup reminder calls.. All good so far. Then at 8:20 am on the day of the appointment I am called to hear that the student is sick, and that they would be glad to schedule me with a professional at  a discount.... Does this stink of bait and switch.. I tell them the offer was a free cut. They tell me they don't offer free cuts...C'mon Aveda, bait and switch i the oldest trick in the book, and everyone sees it coming. If you want to eke $$ out of your marks, try shilling magic hair treatment cremes gels and little glass bottles like most others do... Shame on you Aveda."
1534,3,"The music is so loud you can't have a proper conversation with your hair stylist! I don't think they even heard what I asked for. Not at all what I wanted! Please turn the music down a couple notches, one star for now.Also, the awful music selection creates a disturbing atmosphere."
1535,1,"I  went here because I read the good reviews on Yelp, but I was VERY disappointed by their level of service. If you're reading this review as a first time customer, do yourself a favour and go somewhere else. This place isn't worth it, for all the cool vibe it claims to have and the prices it charges. Here's my experience: When I arrived (on time), the receptionist was on the phone. I waited a bit thinking she would be done soon now that she had seen me, but she just put her hand on the receiver long enough to tell me to take off my coat and hang it on the wall and take a seat. The colourist, Annie, came to get me about 10 minutes later. She seemed completely disinterested in doing her job. She spent barely 10 minutes with me, which included asking me what I wanted, then she went off to mix the color and came back and spent all of 5 min putting the dye in my hair. That was it. She disappeared for the next 35 minutes, without asking if I was comfortable, or offering any magazines to read. I went up to the reception area and got the magazines from the coffee table myself. She came back half hour later to tell me that my time was up and led me to the shampoo station where she handed me off to have my hair washed. I didn't see her again at all after that. She didn't check in to see how the color turned out or if I was happy with it. Another girl led me to a different station after washing my hair, and told me I could use the hair products and a hair dryer there to dry and style my hair myself before leaving. I was very surprised at this, as I have been to a lot of nice salons and I have never had an experience where they just dump me and tell me to style my own hair before I leave! Seriously, I don't know what I paid almost $80 for! This place wasn't the slightest bit interested in having my business as a new customer. Bottom line: I wouldn't recommend this salon AT ALL to anyone. There are plenty of places in Montreal, spend your hard earned money somewhere else where they care about providing good service."
1536,3,"I came here about a week ago to have my hair cut. I told Stephanie that I wanted side swept bangs falling a bit below my brows and what I got was definitely not that. I am left with a short chunk of hair that falls about half an inch above my eyebrows. I also paid almost $90 for the worst haircut of my life and the price I would pay was never made clear to me until I checked out. There is no transition between the ""bangs"" and the rest of my hair (which is quite long, making it very noticeable). I tried for a week to make it work and look good, but I couldn't so I went back today to see what could be done. Stephanie and the receptionist were both extremely rude to me even though I attempted to calmly explain the problem. Stephanie's exact words to me were, ""What do you want me to do? I can't make the hair grow."" and she was overall very dismissive of me and very unprofessional. The receptionist also LAUGHED at a friend of mine that had come with me when he asked a simple question. It is ridiculous to behave this way when you rely on tips and customer satisfaction to make your living. Since they were so unhelpful and disrespectful, I spoke with the owner, Jeff, who was very nice and understanding and offered to fix my hair for free once it grows out a bit more. I will update my review once he has fixed my hair."
1537,2,"I found the staff at the salon very unprofessional. I have been to Adikt salon before when it was still at the old location downtown and really enjoyed the hair cut and the service. When i came to the new location, i arrived 8 minutes early than my appointment time. The salon was closed, so I waited by the door. And then the most ridiculous thing happened. Salon staff started waving me to go away and not stand by the door. There was really not much to go away to and it was already 5 minutes to appointment, so I kept standing by the door. Instead of coming to the door and communicating with me, they kept waving me away in the most disrespectful way. I kept showing them with sing language to come to door and explain why they want me to go away, and finally they came..without introducing themselves, or apologizing for disrespectful behaviour, they told me to go wait elsewhere..because they are not open yet. Needless to say, I am never going back to this salon with such arrogant disrespectful customer service."
1538,3,"My story with Adikt was on a honeymoon until I talked to an obnoxious receptionist that informed me I had cancelled two appointments ""last minute"" and that they had this unwritten policy that ""people like me"" fdon't get to reserve over the phone, that I must come in person and prepay for the services in advance. Without getting into the illegality of such idiocy, I am sorry I won't put my hair in the trust of the much more decent stylists at the salon. Adikt management should know that their downtown clientele is made of busy people with crazy schedules and that we willingly pay the extra bucks for a professional and service-oriented salon.As for my ""crimes"", I was offered an empty spot, as a previous client had cancelled out. I was too quick to confirm and called back minutes later to cancel. By the Way, this cancellation policy ain't written anywhere nor communicated to any of the customers...what a shame."
1539,2,"Edit: Had to change this to a 1 star review (down from 5 stars) after two of their stylists literally dropped their blow-dryers on my head. I was offered a measly discount and a complimentary treatment the next time I go, but I don't think I'll be returning to this salon. I'd rather pay more and not end up with a head injury... Horrible experience."
1540,3,"Yesterday was my first time at Helmet and my stylist was Danny.He sat me down and talked about what I wanted, and really seemed to understand. I had a long pixie that I wanted a LITTLE shorter and thinned out. I specifically said ""I don't want to back any shorter."" And he agreed.When he washed my hair he threw a towel around my neck, not secured, and water went in my eyes, ears and down my back.When he was done washing my hair he put a towel loosely around my hair and again, my hair soaking wet- water got in my eyes, all over me. And he didn't even notice! It was only at the point where I said ""There is a lot of water in my eyes and I wear contacts."" That HE GAVE ME THE TOWEL HE JUST ""DRIED"" MY HAIR WITH. And didn't say sorry for soaking me.With burning eyes and makeup down my face, he started cutting my hair... At first he took off some length on the top... but then he got to the sides and the first snip on the sides- I knew. WAY too short.The entire hair cut he was preoccupied with a street festival outside. There was one point where I even said something to him and he didn't hear me but just pretended to!? It was like a ""hi, how are you"" and he said ""you too!"" No exaggeration- I noticed him looking outside at least 20 times.As we got towards the end of the cut there were tears in my eyes and it was VERY clear I was unhappy. Very obvious he knew this. But he ""played it cool"" with belittling phrases like ""this is your first time going really short, you'll get used to it.""Instead of asking me if I liked it or if I was satisfied he literally said ""okay."" as if to cue he was finished, and polished off the experience by taking my cape off and then blowing all the loose hair on my clothes.This was by far the most unprofessional salon experience I've ever had."
1541,2,"Okay, I had mid-neck length hair, all one length, and slightly hanging-in-my-eyes bangs when walking in. I had a fairly simply idea in mind--as whenever I can afford getting my hair cut, I always ask for this cut, but I like to experiment with different hairdressers as they always cut it too short, but still a good cut. This was my first go at Helmet, and I was assigned Danny, which made me nervous because I read some things here on Yelp about him, but as I am an anxious, shy person I said nothing. I come in for my appointment, and am waiting 20 minutes before I get my hair washed, and then placed at a seat. Danny comes across as a bit of a snob who doesn't give two f**ks about what you have to say, and everything is in one ear and out the other. I had SEVERAL photo references, told him my hair was naturally wavy, even though I straighten it daily, but that I needed him to keep that in mind, and that I ABSOLUTELY did NOT want to go any shorter than an inch below my jaw-line in the front (and the back was to be shorter than the front), that I want asymmetrical bangs--long on one side, and shorter on the other, and I want SOME layers for added volume. What I got was basically a squared-off Frankenstein haircut with HUGE chunks of hair thinned out far beyond anything that was agreed upon. Random chunks of hair lobbed off at the top, which I guess was his version of layering, but he couldn't transition the layers nicely from one to the other, the front that was supposed to frame my face was thinned out so much and cut so short that I struggle to attain volume without using so much product in my hair. My bangs are cut almost in a zig-zag. Hands-down, this is the WORST cut I have ever received-- I almost don't want to leave the house, I'm so ashamed. Not to mention he was so unprofessional, and I was absolutely COVERED in my own hair-- in my eyes, down my shirt, in my mouth-- just everywhere. He just would not stop cutting, and the session went on for SO LONG. Never again."
1542,3,Jason is a nice enough guy but im living with a brutal hair cut that he gave me!!!  Dont see him for short hair!!!  Why not tell someone you arent good with short hair!  Now im living with a terrible shaped hair cut for months!!!
1543,2,"Love the ambience and the people. Their shop in shop vintage boutique always has cool and interesting stuff. The cold beer during haircuts is something seem more often at barber shops, and I always envied them for it. I find it refreshing to find it at a salon for women. Too bad that haircuts not always work for me. I have coarse hair, not the thin, white hipster type. Perhaps someone a bit more specialized on ethnic hair would be a great addition to the salon. Can't wait for that to come back to Two Horses!"
1544,2,"Christie gave me one of the worst haircuts I have ever had. Even after I showed her a picture. She hacked my hair into an odd triangle shape - I cried as soon as I got home. Will never return.I did receive a call from the owner who was very aplogetic and offered to fix it for free. I opted to go with my old stylist for the fix, but the gesture is well recieved and points to good customer service on their part."
1545,3,"I went here to get a hair cut. A guy friend recommended it to me. He told me it was a cool relaxed vibe and for the most part it was. But honestly it seemed more like a playground for the ""party girls"" who run it rather than a place of business. The girl who cut my hair, Izzy, I believe, dresses licentiously, which may explain why my guy friend likes it so much. The haircut was ok, but there are much classier places to get better haircuts."
1546,3,"One of the more unpleasant spa experiences I've had. Without over sharing, let me just say their definition of a bikini line wax is the most conservative I have ever encountered. And I've had bikini waxes for more than a decade, in more than 20 salons. This is the first time a spa said they'd charge me more for doing the top of my thigh. Also the woman double-dipped the waxing stick, which is unhygienic and spreads disease. Not what I was expecting from this type of place!"
1547,3,I have been here a few times for colour and cut. The service is ok overall but the last time (1.5 momy colourist burnt my left ear and scalp when dying my hair. I mentioned at the time my skin felt like it was burning and she shrugged it off saying it wasn't the dye but maybe the cream she used to protect my skin. Wrong. The girl who washed my hair also must not have done a good job rinsing. At the end I woke up the next day to burnt ears and scalp. I've been using cortisone to soothe it the last few months and it still hasn't healed.
1548,2,"I decided to try a new hair salon with a hairdresser who specializes in cuts for curly hair.  What a mistake I made.  Worst haircut ever, no layers - what a horrible haircut.  I am so upset and I can't wait to go back to my previous hairdresser - she was amazing.  I will never go back to this hair salon.  The one positive: the hairdresser was very nice and courteous but, although I was told that she had taken a course on how to cut curly hair, she didn't learn much.  I don't know how I will be able to stand this haircut for the next few months until my hair grows back."
1549,1,Came for a blow out and requested a classic curl look. My hair looked fantastic walking out of the salon - but it barely lasted 2 hours. My hair was flat by the time I got to my event. It was unfortunately a waste of my time and money. I do not recommend!
1550,3,"Whooooaaaaa, RUDE! Unfortunately, the blow out didn't compensate for the attitude either. Walked in to meet people who were already in the midst of their ""blow outs"" & was rather nastily asked to go sit on a bench in the front of the store rather than stand near my family. Hey, if the place was busy, I'd understand but there was one other person there. Maybe they didn't realize I had an appointment & thought I was just there milling around? Quick hint, greet people that walk in the door. Maybe you would've known I was there to get my hair done & you wouldn't have been so rude. The experience didn't get any better from there. Of course if you cancel, they charge you anyway. Negates the need for good customer service...On to the actual blow out. The girl who did my hair asked, ""you really want to just do that"" when I showed her a picture of myself after my last salon visit & then proceeded to shove my head around like a bobblehead. If you need me to tilt or move my head, ask. The heating tools were way too hot. I'm used to stylists adjusting them for hair type & volume. My sisters hair is burnt to hell in the front. 30 minutes later, my ""waves"" are a limp mess. Yelp, you steered me wrong this time."
1551,1,"I'm really dissapointed by the poor customer service here. I booked an appointment online and wasn't able to add the 15% off coupon to the booking, I selected a lady for my service and then emailed to ask if I could attach the 15% coupon. When they emailed back they said I would have to show it in person. A few days later someone called me and said I had to give a credit card over the phone as I wasn't local in order to keep my appointment. I'm not sure why that isn't mentioned online or was told me during my first email corrospondence. So I called back and gave my credit card number to hold the appointment. When I showed up they had just opened and everyone was sitting around looking bored already. Apparently who I had booked for an appointment was no longer seeing me, and a gentleman told me I was booked with him somehow instead. Not sure why honestly. I had thought getting my hair professionally blow dried would be a nice experience and make my hair look a little more voluminous or nice before getting styled, but this was honestly a waste of money for me and quite painful having my hair brushed out. I don't know why more leave in conditioner or detangler wasn't added, I have very very healthy thick hair and brought my own brush even and suggested he use that to brush my hair. He did a little bit, but it was never full brushed out or detangled and was yanked a lot. Just overall not very pleasant. Then for styling my hair it was a little better, not quite what I pictured from what I had shown but not something I could have done myself anyway. The appointment seemed a little rushed, I had planned on 2 hours and each appointment said it was booked for 1 hour but I was done in less than an hour and a half. The gentleman immediately walked out of the salon after I stood up and didn't say anything. I walked around asking if this is where I pay and they asked if I wanted a loyalty card and I said no I don't live in town. I paid and left a 25% tip and then shortly after realized I had forgot to ask about my 15% discount coupon. I returned to ask if I could have that applied and a partial refund and was flat out refused. They specifically knew I didn't live in town and just kept saying you can come back next time. There's just no way I am ever going to bother coming back here to have my hair tugged on and a blow out worse than I can do at home. Hair styling isn't needed all the time, just this time. I really don't believe them that it's impossible to offer a partial refund, every credit machine can have refunds done manually. When I got home and went to take out my hair it was quite hard to do and very very dry and messy. It definitely didn't feel like any sort of luxury treatment for my hair and with the strange and poor customer service I wouldn't recommend."
1552,2,"I booked an appointment for a hair trim for 2pm, 18 September, on the phone with a very nice employee who didn't mind speaking English with me, as I am only visiting Montreal for a short time and therefore don't speak a lot of French. However, I do understand enough French to know when I am not welcome... I arrived 10 minutes before my appointment and the hair stylist was not aware that I had booked the appointment already, and he completely refused to speak English with me. Not even a welcome in French. Then he turned to his other customers and laughed about how I am obviously ""not Quebecois""... I understand enough french to understand that. He then finally switched to English and told me to come back in 20 minutes. Of course I do not plan to ever let this person touch my hair, so I did not return. I have never felt so unwelcome in an establishment in my life... and all because of my nationality. I wish your website said ""We serve Quebecois customers only"" so I could have saved money on my Uber ride."
1553,2,"Went here for a simple manicure with regular polish, and boy was I disappointed. They clearly don't have the knowledge or equipment to do proper manicures or pedicures. They literally rolled up a desk and used a hair cutting chair for my sisters manicure, which she ended up not getting.I have gotten tons of manicures in the past and this lady clearly had no clue what she was doing. She left my old clear nail polish on. Cut only some of my cuticles, barely filed my nails, did the lotion and ""massage"" after my nails were wet and painted. Within 2 days, 8 nails were chipped and 2 were completely ripped off. AWFUL manicure, would not go here again, not sure how they even stay in business."
1554,3,"I visited the salon for the first time this week for an upper lip wax. There was no form to fill out and they didn't ask about allergies or skin sensitivities. After the waxing, I came home to notice that most of the hair was still there. I know the waxing doesn't get everything out but most places use tweezers or threading to remove the stragglers. Suffice it to say, there were more than just a few stray hairs. Also, the price on the website is 10$ and they charged me 12$."
1555,3,"Life for the first time I receive here asymmetric hair, where is my husband want me to go to get again clip . But I really don't want to get more terrible hairstyle, so I built at home, it was wonderful. But there's really nothing in that place except your boss's enthusiasm."
1556,1,"I got gel nails here, and first off, they had very little options for colors. They didn't have the color i wanted, which was a pretty basic one, so they offered to apply a color and apply a different color of glitter on top to kinda resemble it... so one girl started doing my nails, and when it was time to apply the glitter, another nail technician chimed it and was clearly unsatisfied with the glitter, which was halfway done, so she filed everything of my nails and reapplied it super quickly and kinda sloppily to the point where the gel went under my nails. When I got up to pay, she screamed that tip wasn't included. I'm really not a difficult customer when it comes to this kinda thing but I was very unsatisfied with the result because the layers of gel were so thick and chunky, and looked really cheap and tacky. When i finally filed everything off, my nails kept breaking nonstop for 2 months. Would not recommend."
1557,1,"I wish I could give them 0 stars, it was so bad. I got fake nails and their product was horrible. They all broke when I left. Ridiculous. It wasn't done properly. They obviously don't know what they're doing. Wouldn't recommend at all."
1558,2,"If only it was possible to leave a lower rating! I used to enjoy this service years ago, but my last 3 cleaning and 1 handy man appointment were cancelled at the last minute or simply no-shows. Each time, if I was notified, I'd get the same message ""unfortunately the pro called out"", only to find out in some cases no one was scheduled.On FOUR occasions I wasted my time and adjusted my schedule to be home, in one case, the day before my property was meant to close. Inconvenient is an understatement. To add insult to injury, there's no way to reach an actual human. The email customer service simply uses the same copy + paste responses without actually addressing your concerns. It's a disaster and a scam since they actually charge you the day before the service. So when you're cancelled, you need to them submit a request for the credit to be refunded to your method of payment.Fool me four times, I'm the idiot. App deleted, NEVER AGAIN!"
1559,3,"I booked the 6 months cleaning package and scheduled a cleaning. The day before it was due I realised no one had confirmed anything, so I emailed them to confirm and only then I got a reply to my email to say my appointment was cancelled as they couldn't find anyone.They rescheduled the appointment to Thanksgiving day, so I emailed them back to say that wouldn't work because... thanksgiving day. Got several automated emails back saying 'thanks for your response and we've rescheduled to Thanksgiving Day'... grrrr. I rescheduled for another time and sent an email expressing my disappointment and asking for a refund immediately as this was terrible service. I got an email back to say that wouldn't be a problem and my $$ were refunded - great right? No, the cleaner came as scheduled and then I got told that I'd have to pay the cancellation fee as I'd signed up for 6 months. I sent an email explaining the situation and offered to pay the difference to make up the cost of a more expensive one of cleaning. I got three templated emails from three different people telling me that I had to pay the cancellation fee or I could continue the service. Frankly by this stage anything was better than having dealing with this rubbish, so I cancelled my service. Since then, and even with unsubscribing, I've had multiple automated emails asking me to write a review - so I am writing my review and I would avoid this company like the plague, they were horrible to deal with.*Full disclosure, the cleaner who did come - Ivonne - did a fantastic job! But the whole experience was so rubbish that they still only get 1 star."
1560,1,"The most frustrating experience ever! They immediately take all the money from your account and then hardly ever deliver the service. They cancel 30 minutes in advance, reschedule, cancel again, reschedule and then keep cancelling. I made a contract for 3 months, it's now been 6 months and I still didn't manage to use all the cleanings. Every time I complain I talk to a different person based in India. I tried to cancel but they charge 90$ and no refund. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Handy, it is not worth your money and nerves!"
1561,1,"Despite issues with lower-than-average services on each of their visits, I kept going back... The last time, though, the girls broke the electronic controls on my stove. The company paid for the repair, but that was the end of our relationship... I was expecting them monthly... when they didn't come in January on the agreed-upon date, I called and was told that they had no teams to do a house in my area.... gosh, gee.... I live in Don Mills, not Inuvik!!  They said they would send someone when they could... Two more months have passed... Nothing... Sorry... I cannot recommend them."
1562,3,"I acknowledge that, as I don't like strangers in my home, I did not check her work when she was leaving, although she did ask me to see if it was satisfactory.This is not the same woman they sent the first 2 times I used the service, who were very thorough, conscientious and professional.This latest one was very personable and polite, but I was not happy when I subsequently checked her work.  Some examples:-  The bathtub and shower wall were untouched,  I had even removed the curtain and liner to facilitate access.  I guess I had no understanding of what comprised the obvious.- I removed everything from the counter under the bathroom sink and left those doors open.  I said she should clean that (the only cupboards I wanted touched) in lieu of cleaning the master bedroom.  Well, like the shower, it was as filthy before as after.I also had to go over the shelf that is part of and surrounds the bathroom sink (all one [piece) to redo what she missed, although one would think one solid piece of marble should be easy to clean.  All of this is even more strange as she had the bathroom door closed for 20 minutes and I heard a lot of banging.  There is caked in dust on the shelfSimilarly, I had to redo the kitchen counter for grime and grit I felt by passing my fingers over it.  The counted is granite, so it should have been easy to clean.I instructed her not to clean inside any appliances, but i would have though small appliances like my can opener and kettle would have been attended to.The couch cushions were not vacuumed in between.In other news it was unexpected to hear her exclaim the she weighed 70 kilos when she used my scale.  Apparently, as I found out to my chagrin and unnecessary edification that she used to be a model, left behind a six year old son on the other side of the world and wants to study design.If I use Maid TO again, I want a guarantee that she will not be back.  And I want to know what you will do to make whole 1) this appalling excuse for ""services,"" and, 2) how I will get back the 2 hours of my life that I wasted being home for this when I would have been working?"
1563,2,"We booked our cleaning online, but ran into issues when we emailed to ask how long it would take, as we got no reply (even though they told us later that they did, in fact, reply). On the day of the cleaning, only one woman arrived even though we were expecting two (she claimed the other girl was sick), and she arrived just before the cutoff of their arrival timeframe without giving us any kind of heads up. The woman didn't bring anything with her save for a pair of rubber gloves and one or two cleansers even though their website says they bring everything they'll require. Luckily we had supplies on hand (Windex, paper towel, vacuum, mop, etc), because who knows what kind of job would have been done if we didn't have what she needed. The worst part of the experience came when we called the head office to complain, at which point the person we spoke to said they would comp us for the cleaning as well a give us a complimentary cleaning next time. Our credit card was still charged regardless, and we when called to ask why this is, the person we spoke to was very condescending and said there's no way they would follow through on the promises made by their colleague, instead offering us a $20 refund. We told them to forget about it and that we were never using their service again. Based on his response, he didn't seem to care that they were losing our business at all. In the end the girl did a pretty good job and took 3h 45m to clean our 2 bed/2 bath condo, though it would have taken half the time if 2 people had come as expected, which would have been much less intrusive and inconvenient."
1564,1,"I called Aspen cleaners because I read such positive reviews online, however, my personal experience with this company was truly dissapointing.  I live in Toronto and reached out to Aspen to help with a post construction cleaning project and the results were poor at best.  My unit is ~1800 square feet and the cost if the cleaning was 944$, which would have been alright if it resulted in a sparkling clean apartment but it did not.  This particular team was not thorough, missing areas in plain sight, leaving stairs and walls dusty, dirt and stains visible on the floor and whatever cleaning products they used I could see it smeared all over the floor.  Some other areas like the washrooms looked practically untouched with dust and dirt in plain sight.  I sent pictures of the results to Aspen and they did offer to resend the team in the next day, however, I had scheduled trades coming in the next day and couldn't afford to push the schedule back, so, I had to hire another cleaning service that night to clean properly.  The Aspen cleaners also tried to say to the management team that I had trades in the day they were cleaning which is why they couldn't clean properly which was in fact a lie, because I had my sister-in law on site checking in on things.  The cleaners also attempted to leave twice after only two hours citing that they were finished and my sister in law then asked them to go finish more thoroughly, at which point she received a lot of eye-rollowing and attitude (the clean was to be 5 hours total for 3 cleaners = 15 hours).Perhaps it was just this particular team who is lacking skill, because I do see a lot of positive reviews on this company (mostly from the Vancouver region), but unfortuntaley that wasn't my experience and I don't recommend using this company if you want it done right the first time."
1565,2,"The cleaners were friendly and left a nice note. However their cleaning was a complete waste of time. The home was vacant as we were moving. All we wanted was a thorough clean of all floors, surfaces and cabinets. As well as the insides of appliances (as offered by this company). They only cleaned the floors and all the cabinets and washrooms (shower, tub, sink), inside of fridge and kitchen cabinets were not cleaned thoroughly. We had to clean everything from top to bottom ourselves. Which completed the defeated the purpose. Add insult to injury, they sent 3 cleaners to clean a 1000sq ft condo that was completely empty. The job was done in under 3 hours, but we were charged 8hours of work at $57/hour. So we paid $515 for a floor mop. I have requested a partial refund, and the company has only offered me 10% on my next cleaning or credit. They also keep telling me that I should have called within 24hrs. But because I didn't, they cannot help me. I do not recommend this company. Unless you want to overpay for a floor mop.cotton pants once, washed according to the instructions and they came out looking shabby. The local store in Stamford, CT refused to take them back. I had to return at a cost of $7.95 through the mail. The local manager was rude - she actually said that she couldn't take them back because she couldn't resell them - no joke, the pants are defective, why is reselling a condition of returns? I will never buy from Ann Taylor again."
1566,3,"This review is a bit overdue as we moved and had very hectic/busy days lately. I booked with Aspen because of the good reviews but I have to say unfortunately I was not happy with the service. Maybe the secret is if you leave a 5-star review, and the tip is on the house. Tip in general I believe should be optional left to the customers discretion to treat the company when they feel they received a good service. Giving you a bit more details: I required cleaning for my 3-bedroom house BEFORE we move in, so the house had no furniture in it. Now although it's a 3-bedroom house, which was not filthy, I specifically mentioned a few times that ALL I need is a thorough cleaning in the kitchen (exclude the floor), windows (5 of them, only interior) and ONLY the crawl space in the basement (and I asked to get rid of the spider webs). It took 4 hours for a team of 4 people (and almost $800 in cost) to NOT complete this. They mentioned they needed more time. After I returned I was told they didn't have time to clean behind the stove. Also although the crawl space was swept, the spider webs was untouched. Inside the cabinets were cleaned, but the cabinets doors were not cleaned properly. They did a good job with the windows and the fridge though. I feel 4 hours and 4 people and an $800 invoice should be sufficient to complete the job I've requested. I have tried other services before and I feel this was way too pricy and not worthwhile the service. I am disappointed that I had to complete the cleaning myself."
1567,3,"I am writing a second review in follow up of my Sept 11, 2012 review in which the cleaners did not show up for the appointment, or even call to let me know of any delay.The day after the missed appointment, I received a brief email from the owner simply saying 'sorry' - that was it, after the major inconvenience of their reschedule and the crew's failure to arrive on time. Unacceptable.I decided to give them another chance and they chose a new cleaning date of Sept 17. The afternoon before I received a call from the owner saying staff had called in sick and they were not going to be able to keep the appointment.I understand people get sick, but after already receiving terrible customer service, they should be going out of their way to make things right, and cancelling the night before wasn't the way to do that.So we rescheduled for a third time - I am expecting them today, Sept 25, in the next 10 min. I hope our house will actually get cleaned this time."
1568,1,"I am rating them simply on their customer service vs. cleaning, because they still have not cleaned my house - to do so, they'd actually have to show up!I purchased a voucher and couldn't get the date/time I needed so had to go with their availability. They were due to arrive at 1pm today and last night (less than 24hrs notice!) I got an email saying they had to push the appt back to 3pm. That posed a problem because I needed to be somewhere by 5:30pm so the owner said she'd send 4 people to have the house cleaned in 2hrs (instead of 3).At 4pm, no one had arrived or called to say they were going to be late! I emailed and then called the owner (I was unable to reach her).It's now after 6pm and they still haven't even extended me the courtesy of a call to apologize or explain.I understand others have had luck with this service, but if you're considering calling them, you have been warned.(I will update this at a later time...IF they come to clean)."
1569,2,"I've found their service to be very inconsistent.  Our first cleaning with them was fantastic and the next two weren't worth the money.  I did complain to the owner and said I would give them another chance but still no change.  They missed dusting an entire bookshelf and other major things.  They left bags of garbage in our laundry room, rags on the floor and a rug hanging somewhere it shouldn't have been.  I got the impression they were in a hurry to finish and get out of the door.  We won't be using their services again.  It's unfortunate as the first cleaning was really good."
1570,3,"I seem to have been lucky with Classic Maids!I bought a Dealfind voucher forever ago. Luckily, they don't expire, so maybe any rush to use the services had abated by the time I got around to booking them. They actually answered emails which is a major point in their favour with me, and something I've found is far from a given. They allowed me to book that way too which was very much appreciated. They even gave me a cancellation the same week which was fantastic-I was going away on vacation and wanted to treat myself to getting the place cleaned!They send a pretty extensive list of cleaning materials you'll need but seem flexible enough regarding actual versions so I didn't have to buy anything in the end except rubber gloves. My appointment was for 1pm on Saturday. I was a little surprised to arrive back to my building at 12.45pm to find the cleaner there and 16 missed calls on my phone. I suppose it's nice that she wasn't late-but I don't have the psychic abilities to predict that she'll be 30 minutes early and arrange my day accordingly.Anyway, the cleaner herself was very friendly and got to work after a quick tour. Any tour of a one bed apartment can't really take long. I went off to do errands and left her to it. I arrived back after 3 hours and 5 minutes and she was relaxing on the couch waiting for me. She wasn't particularly phased that I was 5 minutes late which was nice.As for the cleaning? It was pretty good. She did things I avoid-like scrubbing behind the toilet and cleaning inside the windows. She didn't clean inside the fridge or oven, she didn't clean under the microwave and don't think she dusted in my bedroom. She definitely didn't do anything like changing the bed linen. She didn't put stuff back where she found it so I had to rearrange when I got back. I actually think she was taking it upon herself to redecorate!All in all it was good. Hopefully there would be a more thorough cleaning if the cleaner was coming every single week. I think you could probably do more in 3 hours when there are only 3 rooms. Have to say that the staff were all very helpful and pleasant though and the experience in general was thankfully unlike the other reviews!"
1571,3,"What is it with these stupid cleaning companies that aren't capable of doing business?This review is merely based on a phone call - if you're overbooked, be competent and HIRE staff. In the real world - if you can't make something happen, that's all the client knows and cares about - they don't care about your BS excuses. A good business will MAKE IT HAPPEN.And another thing - while these groupon-type promotions may be good buzz for your biz, if you can't see anything through, you've just made a bad first impression."
1572,3,"Rescheduled twice due to a mysterious wave of ""sickness"" that has seem to overcome their entire roster of maids. Hired them to clean an empty condo, took time off to bring cleaning supplies for their use since they don't provide supplies, and received an email 20 minutes before the appointment was to start claiming sickness. We had already rescheduled from the day before. No response to phone calls. Completely unprofessional."
1573,2,"I hired this company because they seemed to have many good reviews. They would not commit to a time other than between 8 and 5, but when I pressed them to commit to at least a window of time, said they would call an hour before they came. They were true to their word, and two young women arrived - without a vacuum cleaner. They had to call someone to get a vacuum cleaner. I have a small space - barely 800 square feet, no carpeting, two bedrooms, one bathroom. The estimate was for $100 to $150. I told them they would not have to do laundry, also I have next to no carpeting, and not to bother with the dishes. Ten minutes after the women arrived, I got a call from ""Geoffrey"" that there was much more work and I would have to pay $170. I absolutely refused. To me, it smelled like a scam. When I returned home, I asked the women what it was that had required more work. They replied that they didn't know anything about it. Well, they had done an okay but inconsistent job. There were places where they did not lift objects (like a sound bar) but cleaned around it. Also did not clean completely to the walls in various rooms.  When ""Geoffrey"" called, he noted the women had told him I'd seemed upset. I told him that I wasn't impressed with being asked for more money and told him I felt like I was being scammed. He seemed offended and said if that was how I felt, he wouldn't charge me. I said I was happy to pay $150 but he insisted that he would not invoice me. So, that's how we left it. Also they use some kind of stinky fruity smelling cleaner, all my windows are now open."
1574,3,"I have hired them four times. The first time was average however I gave them a pass as they were learning my space and cleaning requirements. They missed important things like wiping down cabinet doors, wiping down doorknobs and light switches, top of fridge,  dusting very obviously spaces etcThe second time I hired them, they were 4 hours late, although they kept texting me saying they would be there soon.  I ended up cancelling that service after it it was apparent they would be  4 hours late Third time I hired them, they did a good job.  They showed up on time, cleaned like professionals however it was still apparent the cleaning staff was being trained on my dime The fourth, and last time, was this week.  They sent two people for 2 hours and a third person to join for the last hour.   When they left, there were just so many things which were not done correctly; like getting rid of coffee rings on my desk, dusting the tv and tv stand, vacuuming the couch, making my bed correctly, mopping the floors correctly, just seemed a waste of my $210 plus tip. They don't charge per hour, they charge per job, which should only be reserved for a mature company which actually understands what is  involved in completing a job.    What they essentially charge is $35/h per person for a very junior team, a nice junior team, but still a junior team.  This company has more to learn if they are attempting to be a premier service."
1575,1,"terrible customer servicedo not go with this company. they make you wait all day, they keep switching time and when you call to ask when will they be there you get attitude from lee and bunch of excuses.this is unprofessional service.when you are late by 20mintuea lee charged me extra $40 for no reason but when he is late for past 4 hours , i get only excuses.do not go with this company."
1576,3,"I don't like giving bad reviews but I was so disappointed with the service.. the cleaner, Vivienne was an hour late and did not even apologize or give me a reason. She did not care at all to do the job properly, she does not know how to make the bed, she did not wipe countertops or furniture properly.. my place wasn't dirty anyway but i wanted to get it professionally cleaned because I had family coming over the next day for dinner and wanted the place to look sparkly clean..."
1577,2,"I have used Anna 3 times, and twice, I had to clean after them. They only vacuumed and mopped an already clean area and left the dirty area's alone. They did not wipe the floor, they did not vacuum under the dining room table or any spots in the kitchen with food on the floor, nor did they clean the inch of dust in the bathroom floor. The cleaner arrived late and left early. I will pay more to find someone who will actually properly my place."
1578,1,"This company is terribly irresponsible, awful customer support and simply negligent. I would never use this service in the future and have decided to make a point of dissuading anyone I know from ever using this companies service ever again.My neighbour called them in to remove an old cabinet. In the process of removing the cabinet they knocked over a drum of cooking oil they had in the truck. The oil spilled close to a gallon of putrid used cooking oil all over the streets in front of mine and several houses in the neighbourhood. The workers simply stared at the oil oozing out from the truck in confusion as it happened and then drove off. I have made several attempts to alert the company - who are headquartered in the west coast. At first they refused to talk to me about the issue because I was not their customer, since I was not the one who had called them in for the junk removal. Apparently they do not recognize anyone but their immediate customers complaints - even if their companies actions have led to property damage to other parties.After contacting my neighbours, we called in together to complain about the issue. The company then forwarded the complaint to a local manager who contacted me over text message, where I had sent in photos of the problem.They sent out what we thought was a cleaning team of two, who spent 3 minutes looking at the oil spill and then drove off. I alerted the manager to this and she responded with ""they are investigating"". Further attempts at communicating with this manager has been simply ignored by her. It's been close to a month now and the oil spill has not been cleaned up. I believe the company is hoping the rain will wash it away, but there have been several major rainfalls but the oil does not wash away. We have contacted the company again about the issue and are met with the same ""we'll look into it"".  This is fair warning for anyone considering using this service. If there is damage to yours or your neighbours property during junk removal they will not take responsibility for it. HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND USING THIS SERVICE.My group of neighbours are now looking into other actions we can take to force this company take responsibility for their negligent work and behaviour."
1579,1,"The two men picking up my junk were friendly but I have significant concerns. I showed them the items to take away which were the filling: 2 bikes, 2 old TVs, 1 TV stand, and 1 shelving unit (size 6.5 ft x 2ft x 1.5  ft). He told me that the cost would be around $450. I responded with shock as I had looked up rates and there's absolutely no way the items I had would fill up half a truck. He said the shelving unit is comparable to a fridge size which I disagree with. He the asked me what my budget is and showed me the cost for the capacity size. At no point did he show me the truck size. While the two men were very friendly I feel like I was completely ripped off. When signing the papers at the end, he asked for my signatures on a few items. One item had the top covered as of trying to cover it up because he explained the other form but not that one so when I briefly read it (that was already pre-circled for me), there was a section on if I was shown the size of the truck which I wasn't. At this point, I was tired as I was moving and had a lot to do so I just signed it. I can't imagine how many people are in the same boat. I believe I was overcharged for the items I had which did not equate to the capacity and rate I was charged. I will never use this service again and share my experience with others. There are so many other options out there for junk removal and can imagine others who will not rip people off."
1580,1,"So I feel compelled to write a review. I feel I should warn others. When the guys got to my place they tried telling me it was going to cost $500 I told them I had been quoted $150 by another company and then they kinda looked at each other and were like well we can do it for $199. I went with it because they were there and I just needed the stuff gone, but I was blown away that they were trying to rip me off $300. I left message with company and they said they would be in touch within 24 hours and three days later still haven't heard back. I had everything bagged and it took them 15 min. It's crazy too me that they are out there ripping people off who know no better!! Be cautious and shop around before calling these guys!"
1581,1,"CRAP COMPANY. WASTE OF MY TIME TRYING TO PUT IN A REQUEST AND MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND ALL THOSE DETAILS. Most often they don't have people to service the requests.

1582,1,"I would not recommend you use Mopify.  This cleaning company is not reliable nor clear on their policies and procedures.  When I first called them on a Wed, they told me that they would have a cleaner for me by Saturday, and it was enough time.  If not, I would have waited.  They didn't have anyone, didn't call nor apologize.  Then when I got a regular cleaner, the company was not clear about their policies or procedures.I like to follow the rules since I'm new to cleaners.  I had to extract info from the people that worked there about using a lockbox etc..   They should have told me.  And then getting a hold of them by email/phone was annoying because they were not responsive.  Or you would get somebody on email that didn't read your emails and help you.They are based in Ottawa and don't know the Toronto region.  They gave me a regular cleaner who lived an hour away for my place.  This wasn't convenient for her, but she wouldn't say anything.  Also, one of the cleaners broke my shelf, which I was not impressed with.  And they would try and tack on extra time and charge me more, if they had to change cleaners, because their turnover rate is pretty high. Patrick, the manager wasn't very clear, consistent or communicative when I would ask questions and his actions .  This company isn't worth the price, and caused more stress than it was supposed to save.  I have an independent cleaner now who I'm really happy with, is cheaper, she gets paid more and is so much easier to use.  Mopify is not well run and not worth the price."
1583,1,"I had worked for Mopify for roughly 3 months. I had been through countless houses where conditions were terrible, from bugs in the home, to filth that was built up over months before hiring a cleaning service, to customers that were in appropriate towards me. After going through months working without support from my employers, they had fired me without cause! When I asked for an explaination they had just said that ""it wasn't working out""... I had multiple repeated customers that I had started building my own client base, of course we cannot solicits any of their customers so no matter how often I was asked I always respected that rule. Now they have left me without a job, without the customers that I had built relationships and trust with over three months of being their personal cleaner. This is the most unprofessional company I've every worked for. They do not go through a screening of the customers before hand, and if there is an issue while we are at the house, they do not answer our calls to ensure ANY safety for the cleaners themselves. I am disgusted with Mopify. And I would NEVER recoomend anyone use their service due to their treatment of their employees. My boyfriend had also joined the platform a couple weeks after I had, they recently fired him without cause for dismissal as well. He had been in a home filled with cockroaches and bed bugs when I told him to leave the house and call Mopify. It took him roughly 10 minutes of calling and texting them for them to finally answer to give him advice on what to do. They had told him they were sorry everything that was happening and then the next day they fired him. I recorded their conversation and it gave NO indication he was on grounds for termination. He was a 5 star rated cleaner on their platform. Never had a bad review. all his customers loved him. Yet they left us both without jobs or income for 0 reasoning to back up the decision for dismissal."
1584,3,"This is the only signature location for LA Fitness in the GTA, and there is absolutely whatsoever nothing ""signature"" about it!You need to pay an extra 20 or $30 a month to access this location, or simply show up and pay four dollars entry of the door just to get access to this location.But with 100% honesty, there is nothing extra about this place at all whatsoever! I really did not find one thing that is considered an add-on value.I have come here three or four times, and my opinion has always been the same and would not changeI like signature stuff, I look for a VIP in luxury locations, I enjoy paying more if I know that I am getting a value, but this has nothing, Not being salty here, but it's really doesn't offer you anything more than any other L.A. Fitness that I have been to!"
1585,3,"Please DO NOT store valuables in lockers at this gym.  I had my locker (which was secured with a combination lock) broken into the other day.  My wallet and keys were stolen, and then my VEHICLE was stolen right from the parking lot.  The staff was not particularly helpful, nor did they seem all that surprised.  I was not the only victim either.  It's a good facility, but the security here is sorely lacking."
1586,1,"Extremely unimpressed and quite frankly, insulted by this gym! I was naked in the change-room and I looked up to see a woman with a man on her phone screen staring at me. I freaked out and things got a bit heated in the change-room. I went to report it as soon as I had my clothes on- like 3 minutes after it happened(10:20ish) and staff at the front let me go through some photos to see if I recognized the woman. They said they would go over their cameras to find her blah blah blah.... 7:30 that night no one had even called me so I called the gym back. A female answered and told me her manager was working out and told me to call back tomorrow - forreal that happened!!! I repeated myself more sternly and told her to get her manager NOW. She then transferred me to a different office. That man said he'd call me back shortly... he did not. 28 hours later I hear from someone.Nothing has been resolved. They cannot find her, even though you gotta swipe in and thy have everyone's photo or ID on file and cameras everywhere... I'd like to add there are a couple staff members trying to help but managment should have had this resolved that day ...It's been 5 days. Nothing! This is unacceptable!! The entire situation was handled poorly and not by their protocol (from what head office told me).Ladies: BE CAREFUL!!"
1587,1,"Will not be back nor will I recommend this place anyone.The reflexology massage was OK (hence the business name).The body massage was not OK: the lack of draping and overt exposure is unsettling when one is trying to relax. The single towel is simply thrown aside while exposing your body parts. There is no decorum here.The massage therapist had her phone on during my massage and actually took a call during my hour massage. She placed the phone next to me on the bed so I could hear and feel it vibrate when calls/messages were coming in. Very unprofessional. Worst yet was the fact that the female massager decided to massage my breasts while I was lying on my back. I have received MANY massages all over N. America and never once were my private parts rubbed or massaged...not they should they be. This is sexual assault and I should have stopped her then and there but the shock during the assault is paralyzingly. And it was done during the last five minutes of my hour long massage. I will never be back. Lastly, their payment policy should be illegal. If you pay cash, combo 4 (1 hour reflexology; 1 hour body massage) will cost $75. However, if you pay by debit/credit card, a 13% HST is added to your bill.I cannot UN-recommend this place severely enough.You have been warned."
1588,1,Good price but you get what you pay for - a therapist on the phone in the middle of the massage. Also the foot massage took place in a room that didn't really have a seat for that you kinda just there starring at them as you can't even put your head back. When you walk in they give you flip flops to wear that are not one time use so there is plenty people before and after you that wear it ... would not come back nor recommend it .
1589,3,"I went there for five times and realized that there was only one practitioner that can be considered professional. The last visit made me really unhappy. I feel like the practitioner didn't pay attention to what I said(even if we were both speaking mandarin) and did not understand what I meant by ""upper back pain"". She was not focusing enough on that area. She hurt my upper spine when massaging my shoulder muscles. When I mentioned that to her, she said ""it'll be fine in a moment."" Besides, she tried to get rid of an acne on my back with her nails... I don't understand."
1590,2,I had a massage today with my therapist being Fatemeh. She was good but not strong enough and couldn't go as deep as I like. When I paid reception with my Wayspa gift cards I was told afterwards they do not provide insurance receipts for gift cards. I have used these gift cards at various Hand & Stone locations without problems before. It makes no difference on their end how they are paid. I will not visit this location again.
1591,2,"Keeping it simple.I booked 2 massages here for a friend and I. The place is nice, clean. We were offered water upon arrival, did not wait long, friendly staff.Parking was a nightmare. There was not parking so we had to park in an underground garage and it was annoying doing so not being familiar with the area. Second, the massages were not great. The lady that I had was only focusing on one side of my back and she kept rubbing the exact same directly for literally 45 minutes. I started to get really annoyed, I almost wanted to tell her something but I was sharing a room with my friend and I did not want to cause a commotion. Plus, i felt kind of awkward doing so when I still had about 15 minutes left with her. That was a HUGE disappointment. Usually with massages, I walk out feeling lighter, but the massage here felt like I needed another massage.In the car my friend told me she too was disappointed in her.. ""rub.""Great clean place, nice staff, but I won't be going again."
1592,2,"Got a flyer in the mail yesterday and was able to make appointment for today. Reception was friendly and clean as was the washroom. When I met the RMT he asked if there was anything in particular that brought me in today. I told him that I was having pain in my lower back. He then asked me what I do and I said that I was retired. ""So you sit around a lot now?"" ...I thought that was pretty rude and already had my back up...I happen to be very active, running on average 5-10k 4-5 times per week, not that it's any of his business.  Next he asked why I thought I had the pain then. The discussion went from bad to worse and I ended up walking out."
1593,3,Didn't even get a massage and the front desk said the complete opposite of what we asked over the phone. She first asked the wrong name and then said the wrong number after giving her the correct name. We asked about insurance and over the phone she said yes and in person she said no. We drove 15 mins to this place in the city to get no massage because of the way we were treated. She needs to learn her communication skills and people skills!
1594,2,"We booked a friends surprise birthday to go for foot massages and then nearby for dinner. When we arrived, they told us that the person who booked the appointments wrote down the wrong number of guests and they could not accommodate us all. When we had called to book, they told us that they only have 4 chairs in the room and since we were 5 people they said they would move in an extra chair- so it is hard to imagine that they screwed up the number of appointments. That being said, all they had to offer us was a sorry. When we were not happy with that, the receptionist called the manager who offered us a minuscule discount if we came back another day. That's bad customer service! Maybe they should change the name to unhappy foot massage. We will not go back there again!"
1595,1,"Do not go here for a massage. I have been here for reflexology in the past which was fine so I went back for a neck and shoulder tuina massage. It was a horrendous experience and I felt like I was being molested. It was a male masseuse and he kept slapping me along my upper thighs and back. Not sure if this is the type of massage but I've never experienced anything like it before and felt like I was kneaded abruptly like a piece of meat. Will NOT being going back here.cotton pants once, washed according to the instructions and they came out looking shabby. The local store in Stamford, CT refused to take them back. I had to return at a cost of $7.95 through the mail. The local manager was rude - she actually said that she couldn't take them back because she couldn't resell them - no joke, the pants are defective, why is reselling a condition of returns? I will never buy from Ann Taylor again."
1596,2,"First and foremost I'd like to preface that my review is not based on service. In truth, the service I received historically was 3.5/5. The service was not as thorough as it should be, with missed patches and broken hairs, but the staff made up for it by being very personable. The spa has a nice feel and is well maintained. My negative review stems from a conversation I had with the manager surrounding delinquent membership fees. I subscribed to their membership on October 27th, 2015 which entitles me to UNLIMITED Brazilian waxing, and 10% or 20% off of other services for $35 a month. I went back on November 9th, 2015 for a subsequent Brazilian (and other services) before my wedding. I was then charged $35+tax on November 27th, 2015, and again December 27th, 2015. I did not go in for those services. In early January, my credit card was compromised, and all pre-authorized debits needed to be updated. After undergoing the process to recover my credit card, I decided I no longer want preauthorized debits to go through. Allure sent me emails regarding the failed transactions, and I did not notify them thinking I could just go in and pick up where I left off. Of course, I should have been more proactive. Of course, I should have let them know of my situation. Bottom line is that I didn't. I called to schedule an appointment to go in, and notified them of the situation. Since they could not accept post-dated cheques, and needed pre-authorized payment, the receptionist said I could get a pre-paid card. This takes about 2 weeks, so I offered to provide it when I got it. She said that wouldn't be a problem. I asked what would happen to the nearly $80 I had been charged without service and she said they would disappear. I didn't accept that and asked to speak to the manager.Frank, the manager, took over from there. While I was not hearing the answers I wanted to from the receptionist, at least she was pleasant. Frank was the opposite of professional and courteous. First of all, he equated the membership to a gym membership and said ""if you subscribe to a gym membership and don't go, would you ask for your money back?"". This is an incorrect analogy. What Frank should have asked was ""If you purchased a personal training package scheduled for x number of sessions and missed two sessions, would you ask for those sessions back?"" To which the obvious response is YES. I'm not asking for money back, I'm asking for the money I've paid to be applied as a dollar amount to services. Frank's resolution was that since I had a service November 9th (which was included as part of my October payment) I could receive December's payment as a credit. Ultimately, since I used a service I was entitled to on November 9th, November 27th would pay for that. He claimed that I wanted $80 of service for $35. This was not the case. Do I accept responsibility for the lack of communication? Yes. However, in the interest of customer service and retention, do I believe Frank was fair? Absolutely not. I was prepared to fix the problem and remain loyal, but I did expect service for money paid. He felt that I was being cheap and asking for services I was not entitled to, and made sure I was well aware of how he felt. I, of course, will not be returning and hope they change their policies to be more catering for the client. This industry relies heavily on word of mouth and sadly I don't have a lot of good things to say about Allure."
1597,2,"I have been getting Brazilian waxing done for years. I went to Allure after work one day when I happened to be in that area of town. I thought that, as a wax-only establishment, they would have perfected the service. I was very wrong. The employee (I forget her name) was unprofessional. She was complaining to me about how she had to work from 12 to 8 pm instead of her usual 12 to 5 because her colleague was missing work to get a mammogram result (seriously). Perhaps she took her anger out on me because this waxing experience was by-far the most painful I have ever experienced. And I have had a lot of Brazilian waxed done over the years. If this was my first one, I would NEVER get another one EVER. Fortunately I know better and will just never go back to Allure for any service."
1598,1,"I'm not sure why most of the reviews are praising 'painless' waxing experiences because mine hurt like hell. (Makes sense that most of the 5-stars reviewed are filtered). I've had Brazilian waxes for 5-years, and it usually doesn't hurt that much. Although, Alaa waxed pretty quickly (thank god) in a dark room, I thought she did a good job at that time. It was not till I got home, I saw that ALL of my pores down there were bleeding and red.  It was painful to even touch that area, and it felt like pins and needles were poking me. I also noticed her waxing was not thorough - I obviously couldn't see the spots she missed in the dark room. Irregardless of the poor waxing job done (and the painful days thereafter), the service was very good. Alaa was very friendly, and reminded me to review her business on Yelp and Like them on Facebook. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be returning to Allure Body Bar.Note: The receptionist is a man, who will ask you how your Brazilian wax experience went. For those who will feel uncomfortable with this, I advise you go elsewhere."
1599,1,"Extremely disappointed- this place is not set up for doing pedicures. They put us in uncomfortable seats, brought buckets of blue water in trash bags and were not very experienced at doing pedicures. The room was dingy and the service was expensive. Avoid if you want any kind of pedicure."
1600,1,"Would not recommend this spa at all, and definitely will not be going back.Got the ""Just a Taste"" spa package (30min swedish massage, mani, facial) which I clearly had booked and stated to the receptionist upon arrival but we'll get to that later...Massage was ok. No ambiance or music to speak of but overall good for a quick 30 mins.I had my manicure and facial scheduled with Rebecca. Alarm bells first went off when she brought in a tub of water and began to set up for a pedicure. Despite my insistence that I had booked a manicure, she continued to set up until she took a closer look at the log form. Instead of setting up the room for a manicure, which she explained usually involves a table, she merely left me half lying down on the table so I had to awkwardly twist for her to reach my nails. I was disgusted to see that she continually used the same towel to catch my nail filing's to wipe my hands and to apply lotion.Facial was ok but I was shivering at this point.Coming back to the receptionist, still in a bit of a post-massage haze, I was charged for my procedures. It wasn't until I was leaving the building that I noticed she had charged me for each individual procedure rather than the package, charging almost $20 over the actual price. When I returned with my receipt she was at first in denial over her error and finally, begrudgingly attempted to refund my money and re-charge the actual amount. Instead, although the receipt read 'Transaction cancelled' she assured me my money had been refunded.Of course, as I returned home, both charges appeared on my bank statement. Unable to fix the problem over the phone and having to speak more with this incompetent receptionist, I eventually had to go out of my way to return to the spa and refund my money in person, receiving only a brief and unconvincing apology despite the huge inconvenience for me.Needless to say, I will not be returning and I recommend you do not either."
1601,1,"This was the worst massage I've ever had in my life.  It's was extremely clear that the masseuse had no knowledge of the human muscular system, any massage techniques, training or certification to actually perform a massage. Immediately began to look up where I could get another massage while getting dressed. Then charges for a 75min massage when only was in the room for an hour. On top of that it was expensive... overall fail."
1602,1,"I'm no stranger to the spa experience.  So I was happy to find this little gem -- and they're part of the SpaFinder group, so I was hoping to use my gift certificate.I pre-booked online 2 weeks in advance through Cleverfox.  Was pleasantly surprised to receive THREE confirmation emails leading up to the appointment date.  I was also able to directly contact the spa to change up my package options.  Spoke with Linna who was very helpful and confirmed everything for me.Arrived for my appointment to find that they had no idea what the schedule for the day was -- their computer was down.  But they took me anyway because it was empty.  They couldn't take my gift certificate because they couldn't connect to the SpaFinder site.My unexpected arrival clearly threw them off completely which may explain this next little fiasco...Finally, I was prepped for my massage when my therapist arrived with my hot    paraffin wax treatment for my pedicure.  I guess blasting all of your heating equipment on high for that unexpected customer can be blamed for the 1st degree burns I now have on my feet.Needless to say the massage and back scrub occurred in an extremely tense setting.I'm happy to have survived this experience, but I think I'm obligated to warn anyone seeking professional spa treatment.  This place terrifies me!"
1603,3,"I just came back from a massage and I was quite disappointed...The staff doesn't speak a lot of english but with a little patience we were able to understand each other no problem.I went for a 45 minute massage and was greeted by the receptionist upon entering. I filled out the paperwork and wrote on it a couple of times that my problem area is my right shoulder blade. My masseuse didn't even look at the the form and when I went in the room she just told me to take my clothes off and cover up with the blanket. She didn't ask me any questions. She left the room and I did so.She came back and asked me where I had pain. I told her my right shoulder blade. She even touched it and repeated me. But she spent barely any time on it and I even asked her at one point if she could go back to it. She rubbed over it a lot but I have knots in there that really need out. I kept expressing the soreness in that area and the knots that I have. She focused a lot on my neck which is also a problem but I was specifically there for the shoulder blade. Even if she couldn't get the knots out I just really needed her to try. And then she told me to sit up which I thought was odd. But they obviously have different massage techniques here so I went with it. I held the blanket up with one hand as she was doing stuff with my other arm and then switched sides. But then she took both arms to do something else and I was sitting there topless... She was behind me but still. I'm a very open person and I actually don't care about being topless in front of other women. (I'm a performer and have quick changed so many times in front of other cast and crew.) It just seemed weird to me... maybe I'm ignorant to the technique or the Asian culture. But usually you ask someone if that's alright, right?Then she finished what she was doing as I was sitting up and just told me, ""Okay, finished. You feel good?"" I didn't really know what to say... I just kind of smiled and said yeah. I also don't think I got a full 45 minutes. I know I went in a couple minutes early but I don't think I went in 10 minutes early.Anyway, my neck is really sore now from the massage (which I know can be expected) but my right shoulder blade is still the same as before. SighThis really wasn't worth my time or $70, unfortunately. Luckily, most of it was covered by my Spa Finder gift card.At least the staff were friendly and the place seemed quite clean."
1604,3,"1st of all, they don't fully honor wayspa gift certificates!  I presented my $50 gift cert for my spa package and they said that they will only honor $40 of it.  ?!?!?!?!  No explanation was given except that's the way it is.ALSO! - They have a coupon on their website for all these specials - they dont' even know what it is!  Be careful when you call and book an appointment, they have so many different packages listed that the one I booked (from their website), was NOT on their printed spa menu and it was also not on wayspa.The actualy service was mediocre.  Highlights included the ladies there trying really hard to do a good job (my pedicure was only mediocre, but she was very nice).  The facial was average with minimal extraction work.I don't know if I would go back.  Despite them ripping off $10 from my package and NOT accepting their own website voucher (I did not argue with them as english communication was tough), the package was cheap.  Pedi / Head wash and facial for $85.I would try a body massage next time - seems like something they would be okay at.  I do have to commend the ladies for trying to do a good job."
1605,1,"All I can say is don't come for your mani pedi, the 3 women got into a full argument about who was going to do my nails (in mandarin) they unfortunately did not know I understood mandarin. I should have known better and walked out then but my feet were already in the water. The woman that did my nails was so upset I got cuts on my toes and fingers. She did not use cuticle oil or water on my nails so I've been putting antibiotics on my nails since this awful experience. I'm officially traumatized from getting a mani pedi. Not a relaxing experience at all and the women were extremely unprofessional. Save yourself, don't walk in here."
1606,2,"I bought a Groupon for this place to help recover from a trip where I walked 10 miles a day for two weeks, as well as for a birthday treat. This was anything but.The staff was awful. They barely spoke English. I booked an appointment for myself and an appointment for my husband right after me. When I arrived, I explained to her that I would be redeeming a Groupon for both me and him. She insisted that I had not booked my husband's appointment and that he would have to reschedule because she was ""busy"" and that I had to contact him to reschedule the appointment. Yep, me, not her. Thanks for the heads up, lady.I thought maybe there was something lost in translation and tried to figure out if she understood that the next appointment she was ""busy"" with was my husband. I tried to tell her that she should have been ""busy"" with the appointment I booked days in advance for him, but it was unclear whether or not she understood. She continued to insist he could not come in. She took down the Groupon number for both Groupons anyway, even though I was the only one that actually received service.After all of that confusion, I turned to the masseuse who seemed to be waiting for something to do. I had showed up in sweats, and just before I was about to walk in to the room the staff stopped me to ask if I was pregnant. I thought maybe this was some kind of medical question for safety, but when I said no the entire staff was beside themselves laughing, clearly because they thought I was fat. No apologies, or even a hint that this was some kind of awkward laughter at their mistake. They just thought it was funny to insult me. I nearly walked out, but I had already paid, and thought you know.... I came all the way out here. At the very least I can get what I came for.The massage itself was terrible. It was noisy in the spa, one of the male workers kept talking loudly to the masseuse through the door. The massage ""rooms"" where more like bathroom stalls in that the walls were thin and didn't go into the ceiling. So joy for me when a wedding party who had also bought Groupons came in and I could hear their entire conversation like they were in the room with me. Since the masseuse spoke zero English, there was no way to communicate to her what I needed and where it hurt. She was also doing strange things that seemed like a way of buying time to get through the 60 minutes, such as lifting up my extremities as high as possible and then dropping them on the table repeatedly, and sticking her fingers in my ears and swirling them around before wiping her fingers on my hair.After the masseuse lifted up both my legs above her head for the 30th time, she unceremoniously dropped them while yelling ""FINISH!"" then walked out of the room and shut the door. I dressed myself as quickly as possible, but I couldn't escape fast enough. The woman at the front desk yelled and stopped me to pay ""tax"" just as I set foot on the pavement outside. She then rung up $5.00 plus tax on a machine and then told me it was time to tip her. I paid the amount so she would let me leave. I've never been asked to pay extra ""tax"" on any other Groupons before, and think this was her way of screwing me out of a few extra bucks.I paid for ONE Groupon, I went though the experience. But now I discover that they've redeemed both Groupons. So now I get the joy of trying to get a refund for Groupon for services they claim to have rendered.I've never been so insulted and furious with such terrible and selfish service. I feel scammed and cheated. This was supposed to be a birthday present and they ruined it. Never again."
1607,2,"Went with some girls friends for a one hour massage. Upon arrival there was confusion about our groupon. Finally in a room with one of my girlfriends and about five minutes into the massage there's a knock at the door. It was the make that greeted us at the front. The wiped the towel off my head and says ""I take over"". Confused I look up and said ""nope she'll do fine"". The massage was not relaxing. You can hear everyone and everything going on in there. The two ladies doing the massages did nothing but talk and whisper the whole time. When they finally finished and we were ready to walk out the door we were charged a tax on our groupon. Then told me friend she had to pay a tip. Will never go back there again."
1608,3,"Found it unprofessional. When I was lying down in my robe with my bra straps down, my esthetician was constantly leaving the room and leaving the door wide open and there were handy men working in the hall just outside the door. I mentioned this to her but it still happened. Someone took her place for the last part of the facial and all I heard from her was 'you're face is so red!'. They also mopped the floors and cleaned up in my spa room while I had a mask on because they were closing. I felt uncomfortable the whole hour. Also she was really rough with extractions, someone at work thought I got punched in the face the next day. :("
1609,2,"Like hundred of other Groupon customers, I bought the iLipo sessions and started coming about a month ago.  When you enter the place looks like a decent nail salon, however once you go down the stairs, the BASEMENT is like a mini-factory.  multiple beds separated by thin white curtains and iLipo machines linked up ready to take on gullible and naive customers.  The beds are so close to each other that my elbow hits the other person on the other side of the white curtain.  And there is no sound proofing here, every breath you take can be heard by the bed next to you.  this place is horrible in general.  you lie on paper sheets.  you can hear every footstep above because the basement is barely 6 feet tall.  it is HOT down there with no ventilation.  they have everyone from the receptionist to the cleaning staff putting the laser pads on you, no questions asked, and after you are done and the machine beeps to its death, NOBODY COMES TO GET YOU.  nobody asks you how the session went and there is absolutely NO ONE WHO WILL MEASURE YOU, as i'm told some other places will do a before and after assessment on whatever body part you are trying to magically minimize.lastly they have definitely over-sold their availabilities, it's like hell trying to get an appointment, i will for sure refund the groupon and move on to other healthier options."
1610,3,"Wow, I can't believe my ears. After trying to get a hold of someone at this spa a few times, and leaving messages, I didn't get a call back so I just thought I'd try again now. To my surprise, someone actually picked up the phone--a young man, who immediately asked me to hold, and he put the phone down so I could overhear everything that was going on there at the spa. There were apparently two women there (one a former customer with a friend?) who were shrieking extremely loudly in an Asian language, and then I could hear the spa employee (the young man) stating impatiently that the spa doesn't give refunds, while the customers yelled back that they had paid $1600 worth, and the man barked that they had caused so many scenes and they don't give refunds and she hadn't paid that much in the first place, then the customers continued yelling loudly, with both sides growing angrier. Then the young man said ""take this money and go, don't come back"" (a partial refund?) and then another employee chimed in, while the customer yelled they had damaged her stomach or something, totally relentlessly arguing. What a terrible scene. After holding on the phone for more than 10 minutes, I was stunned when I could hear someone walking back to the phone, and promptly HANGING UP THE RECEIVER!"
1611,2,"I just pass this place, they invited me to come in, and said will give me a deal.  After 2hour shopping, I am very tired so I decided to try. However, here it was really dirty and uncomfortable. All the towls is unclean and have strange smell. As other review said the lady ask for more tips. I never come back, terrible place."
1612,2,"I get frequent Chinatown massages & treatments, so the bare bones aesthetics of the place didn't phase me. I'm also have a background as a natural health practitioner myself  (though I don't work too much in that field currently) so I'm very familiar with the various ways reflexology and shiatsu are performed. But I was shocked at how poor the bodywork was here. It literally just felt like she had been randomly called upon to rub my feet and back. There was no proper reflexology technique used, and the ""shiatsu"" was just her elbows being dug into me. I don't think she actually hit one real pressure point.To be honest, the level of expertise of the massage here was so low, that I started to suspect that maybe this place was an ""exotic"" massage parlor and that I'd made a terrible mistake. The fact that I heard several men come in and ask for one particular woman by name didn't help that. Nor did the fact that they used Jerkins and baby oil for the massages. While most of the women working there were dressed in comfy yoga pants, I also was a bit thrown that one employee was wearing heeled wedges and a denim mini skirt (in the middle of winter, no less). It just seemed out of place for any legitimate bodywork establishment.While my masseuse was certainly pleasant enough, I would *never* return to Sansan.Not only was the massage terrible, the towels were extremely dingy. Not just a little. A lot."
1613,3,Service was terrible the guy who worked on my feet fell asleep part way. I've been to other massage centers and received much better service. They also stopped at 45 min and didn't give 1 hour like advertised.
1614,1,"I recently went for a haircut at the location in downtown Oakville, I had very healthy long hair and I asked for a basic classic A-line bob. The hairdresser greeted me, took me back to the chair, barely listen to what I had to say,I tried explaining  to him that I have very curly hair texture and that it was best we cut it dry.  It was straight and easier to cut the right angle, he agreed.  He stood me up combed my hair out, flat iron it straighter,  burned my front turning my beautiful white hair yellow and then took a men's razor and chopped off my hair with the men's razor and attempted to angle it, when I asked him that's the best way to give me a haircut? he said yes, a lot of people don't know how to use it and then he was done in two minutes.  It looked like someone cut off my ponytail, he took off about 7 or 8 inches, you could see that it was not a good haircut there was no texturing on the ends no blending in, he said I didn't wash your hair so I'll charge you half-price. I nervously walked out of there and cried all the way home, it took me years to grow my hair and it took two minutes for an idiot hairdresser to cut it off.  I had to go to another hairdresser and have them correct the mess he made and lose more length in my hair. He was supposed to be the master stylist at the salon. Do yourself a favour and don't ever risk getting your haircut over there. Senseless, incompetent and very unprofessional.  To think that I had to pay him money to do what my husband could've done at home. When I got home my family asked what the hell happened to my hair, we couldn't help but laugh at the disaster he made. Someone should take his license away."
1615,3,"DO YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR?one customer's story....i check online to book an appt but cant do that same day online...no problem. so i call to book ..only senior stylist is available...im looking at his name and price ($117) on web site while receptionist proceeds to tell me itll cost $158. when i question her (i am only getting roots done after all)...she giggles embarrassingly and says ""oh yes, that's right-it is $117"". so great, im good to go. aside from fact that i get near 3rd degree burn from abesent-minded millenial behind the blow dryer..im fine with everything and throw my hair up in a pony tail and hat and proceed to pay. ""that'll be $178.54"" to which my jaw drops. i wait while receptionist calls senior stylist, they mutter under breath and im charged $129 with no explanation. feels to me like theyll charge the highest price they can get away with here at the rosedale location. so i pay and head home.this is where it gets really good...i take my hat off and my husband says ""wow -you went dark"". i run upstairs to examine in mirror (and proper light). you really cant see anything in their dimly lit salon. i am aghast to find out that my hair is jet black. almost blue black. i havent been this dark since i was an angsty sixteen year old. i have no idea why the stylist picked this colour. not only is it completely age inappropriate, he gave me the distinct impression he was consulting my 'file'. you see i had been going to queen street location for years. you become a frequent flyer when youre as grey as i and have to get your roots done every six weeks. and i can assure, ive never once been black haired walking out of queen street civello. now with hair this black its gonna need to be touched up every 3 weeks. thats not so good for my pocket book.insult to injury...i discover the millenial missed rinsing out all of the dye in the back of my head, its all wet and goopy and leaving marks behind on my sofa pillows.so now im really irritated..i call and ask for a manager. sing-songy receptionist (male this time)...says he can help me. he starts to utter the words ""you can come back in..""i stop him in his tracks.. you see theres no way to go light from black...without bleach. i recently spent 12 months recovering  from bad dye job at aveda institute -was trying to be cheap and go to students. this is partly how i justify spending so much for root touch up...thinking to myself...you get what you pay for. im thinking going to the pros will mean at least my hair will be healthy. so sing-songy assures me the manager Petra -will call me back in 48-72 hours. wow -she must be really really busy, even my family doctor gets back to me quicker than that.she never calls.so in the end, i'm out $129 for the worst dye job of my life. im relagated to looking goth for the next several months. and i get not so much as phone call from the salon. - on a positive note - at least i didnt spend $158 plus tax for it ($178.54)."
1616,3,"After a recommendation from a friend, I purchased a gift card as a holiday gift for a coworker from Civello in December 2017. I was looking forward to using our gift cards together. The gift card never arrived. I emailed four different times. Twice asking when it would arrive and later asking for a refund. The last time I received a response was in February saying that I would be refunded. I have still not received a refund. What poor customer service! I saw on the Chicago location that someone wrote a similar review. Not okay."
1617,1,"I honestly don't get why this place has any good reviews, the moment we walked in the entire experience was bizarre and rushed. While I don't require much for a pedicure, I at least expect someone to be someone nice to me during the entire situation. I made an appointment for 2 people (2 regular pedicures and 1 shellac manicure-I decided against the shellac after I saw that shellac itself is 35$ + extra if you want a senior specialist) Regardless me and my friend went in. The owner and nobody greeted us for about 10 minutes after we arrived, we awkwardly stood there waiting, while the owner stood at the front fully looked at us and continued talking to two people he knows. When we received the pedicures, the employee who did mine was friendly enough, but my friends person could not be less friendly. She refused to say hi, and then did the whole pedicure in about 5 minutes before saying nothing and storming off. Overall it was a unpleasant experience, and I wouldn't recommend going here. There's tons of nail salons in the area to choose from."
1618,3,"This place is very hit or miss depending on the technician. I've had shellac removal and application take almost 2 hours and turn out awful, but then I've been in and out in an hour and the polish lasted 3 weeks. There is a major communication breakdown with a lot of the staff because they do not speak English well, but pretend to understand until it's too late...I want to like this place because its so close and convenient to where I live, but every time I'm in there I hear someone complaining (about something legit) so I'm not sure what the problem is... I've overheard the male technician (who seems to be the manager) tell a client who was complaining about a bad manicure that she should've requested a senior tech for an additional cost of $5 if she wanted a better job done. I feel like that's absurd.Anyway there's nowhere else to go in this area, so if it's not this place it's Forest Nails and Spa or Mani Pedi spa down at yonge/summerhill. Good luck!"
1619,1,"ROSEDALE/DEER PARK BEWARE! Absolutely terrible. Without telling me, they used acetone on my nails and it ate away at my nail bed and weakened my nails. The aesthetician also forced me into additional services in the middle of my appointment after my hesitation, then up-charged me. Staff was very rude, not trained and barely spoke English. Defensive and not willing to understand my feelings after being taken advantage of. Unhygienic waxing room, cheap nail polishes/products and ingredients. They are taking advantage of customers. I recommend Mani Pedi or 123 Nails in this neighbourhood."
1620,1,"Terrible account services. Apparently the only way to cancel your account is if you talk to jacob. He never calls you back, is always on break and dodges your email as well. I switch my cc and was called by there accounts team that i need to update my card. I mentioned i would gladly give them my new card to pay missed dues but i want to cancel. They took my card info and then didn't cancel put it on freeze. Later when i called back to speak to the girl. She mentioned she had no authority to cancel the account so she put it on hold. That i would need to call jacob who isn't in. I ask her to have him call back never did. She gave me the national number and again coun't reach anyone to cancel.  Totally scam. I'll be reporting to bbb."
1621,2,"terrible customer service. the gym is fine if you never have any bureaucratic issues that need attention. i've joined goodlife two separate times for mere convenience of location and both times i've encountered issues that required interaction with head office, and both times i've been totally astounded by how they treat their customers. seriously, goodlife has shown some of the worst customer service i've ever experienced, hands down. after my last experience with them i will never, ever be giving goodlife my money again. i will travel out of my way to a different gym if need be. it's not worth the headache."
1622,1,If you are a visitor from out of town do not come here .. rude customer service and they try so hard to sell u a membership... annoying and I had to leave because the man trying to push the membership when all I wanted was a week pass made me feel really uncomfortable.. then had the courage to hit on me.. sexual harassment at its best. Never coming back to this gym. Warning do not go here. Update: Michael had the nerve to call me today.
1623,1,DON'T GO TO THIS GYM!!!! My nephew who's visiting our relatives there in Toronto got robbed in this gym yesterday! His locker was broken into and all his credit cards and important IDs were stolen right off the bat! And all he got from the staff was it's not their responsibility- what the hell!!!
1624,3,"You smell it before you set foot into the gym. Once you get to the locker it gets worst. Idk if they ever clean the gym, if they do. They don't do a good of it as the smell is always there.What I love about planet fitness is the low cost of the plans. There's no towel service nor do they provide shampoo or soap, which I'm fine with because I'm very brand specific due to preference. What I don't get is, they don't have a place for you to place your stuff in the showers, except the floor which is really gross.This gym is busier than the Gerrard square location. Due to location and the fact that Gerrard location is still relative new."
1625,1,"I recently moved and came in to cancel my membership.  I was told by the front desk staff that since I was under contract,  I needed to come back and cancel in person again on November 28 to avoid the cancellation fee.  I put it in my calendar and when I came back today, was told that I could have cancelled at any time, and am now being charged the annual fee in addition to next months fee. While not expensive I feel like I have been scammed and was clearly misguided by staff. Is this how Planet Fitness makes their money?"
1626,3,Today kind of busy night at gym! Feeling not that satisfied... no paper towel  to clean ur station after workout! Workers noticed that there is no paper towel but the worker not even try to fill the paper towel box. Feeling not that comfortable to workout today coz i dont want bring germs every where...
1627,2,"After being a plus member at this gym for over a year, I was harrassed by a staff member because apparently I was sitting too close to a friend in the hot tub, with our legs touching. I asked the staff member his name and he wouldn't tell me. I came closer to look at his name tag and he physically pushed me. I filed a complaint because I felt that this was totally inappropriate and homophobic but nothing came of it (I got a voicemail a week later from someone and was never able to get ahold of them). Tensions Rose in the changeroom and I heard stories about other members complaining about the 'intimate incident', apparently he said I was sitting in my friend's lap! I wondered whether the staff member was spreading rumours, since practically no one else was there. On my last night this staff told me I couldn't wear my bathing suit on the elliptical in the change room workout area. There was a rule on the wall so I left the elliptical. When I attempted to broach a conversation about what had happened in the past the staff refused to talk to me. When I went to the pool, moments later he was following me with another staff pointing me out. Later in the hot tub this staff asked me to speak to him privately. He reiterated the rule about not wearing the bathing suit as if I needed to hear it again. When I talked to the manager about this she claimed she had been told that I had refused to follow the rule when told. This was a lie. All in all the staff harrassed me by stalking me around the building, shamed me for being close to my friend in the hot tub, pushed me physically, lied, gaslit my claims and I suspect spread rumours. I quit."
1628,3,"16 dollars for swimming if you here before for any reason, activities, you have to pay.  I was here for newcomer Youth Advisor, but today is my first day for swimming, they let me pay 16 dollars. Before I don't know reson, i want to know more informations, but the women who has light black skin and short curly hair in the reception, she answer me with racial discrimination tone!!!So bad experience!!!! And i heard that she told the other woman who work there also, she said""they are sitting here because they dont want to pay for only 16 dollars."""
1629,3,"I had a terrible experience. I went to apply for a membership and the lady on the phone pretended to be nice . She told me something about a 2 week free membership and lied about them having sports equipment and supplies. I explained that I was going from Bathurst and Lawrence and she was all "" yes we definitely provide everything. "" So I get there and ask for a squash raquet and ball and the desk lady was very rude and disrespectful. She made fun of me and told me off. I had to complain back to head office about her lying to me. The experience was very frustrating and upsetting."
1630,1,"I've been here off and on since 2008, and here of some of the things I don't like about this YMCA:-It's cold. In the winter time it feels like there is no heat on whatsoever, so after you finish a workout - if you're at all sweaty you're going to get an instant chill. -One elevator. Most people here take the stairs to go between the floors, and nothing is just on one floor. The staircases are not heated, which also contributes to the chills. -It's awkward. Not only is there no music playing in the background of any room in the YMCA, but it's fairly silent in the workout rooms. Some music might help cut the tension. -Not many spin classes. -For weightlifters. The weightlifting room upstairs isn't large enough to house the capacity of it's customers. I work out in the days and at non-peak hours, and still have trouble getting a machine. People are always waiting. -Sauna. This is the same for the sauna. It seats about 5 people comfortably, but generally we have people standing up waiting for another person to leave the seated position. It makes everything uncomfortable. This YMCA was less busy years ago when I joined, but hasn't adapted to the growing consumers as the area becomes busier and busier. I try to go as late as possible in the evening, but still have troubles getting weight benches. Avoid this place on the weekends at all costs. Also, turn on the heat please."
1631,2,"I was a member of this Y for a few years, but quit out of frustration with assorted management and staffing issues.  (E.g. personal trainers no-showing for sessions, non-enforcement of gym etiquette [I watched staff watch gym users walk on the stretching mats in bare feet - euwww].)That was a few years ago, and I'd been thinking I'd like to join a gym again, so I checked out this one.  I figured maybe in the intervening years they had sorted out some of the issues.One of the staff gave me a tour of the place.  The new renovations are very nice.  But - the spin class has music playing VERY LOUD.  Like, crazy loud.  Way beyond a level that is safe for your hearing.  And you can hear it all over the that level of the gym, even out into the foyer.  This was at 7 in the morning, a time when you'd expect the gym to be fairly quiet.  In fact the quiet would be one of the main reasons to go to the gym at that hour. I cannot stand extremely loud music on a bad sound system, so I asked at the front desk what the options were for turning it down at least a little.  Guess what?  There are no options.  The spin instructor can play their music at any volume they please and it's tough luck if other gym members are bothered by it.  The front desk person kept trying to avoid the issue by suggesting a number of ways I could work around the loud spin classes, but for over $700 per year, is it so much to expect a little peace at 7 in the morning?  I should work around the preferences of the staff for a class that I'm not even *in*?Again, this is an etiquette issue.  If I had my music blaring on an iPod, I'd be asked to turn it down.  But spin instructors have free rein.In the end the front desk actually told me that I should not join the gym.  And his attitude reminded me of the bad old days when I used to go to that gym.  The staff really couldn't care less if you run into problems.  They run the gym to suit themselves."
1632,1,"I recently got a free two-week trial. I've been here 3 times and I already hate it. The only time it's not busy is very early morning. Anytime around 1:30/2pm until close is so crowded.There's absolutely no room to workout anywhere with DBs. I like to use free weights more than machines and there's only two benches that are in front of the DB racks. There's basically a phone booth size area in front of the dumbbell rack behind the benches to do excercises that don't involve a bench (curls, squats, presses, etc.) There aren't any kettlebells that I could see either.There's two side on the 4th floor: all machines side and free weights/barbells/some machines on the other side. On the free weights side, there's only one leg press machine which is extremely old and squeaky. There's a new leg press machine but it's cable based.There's also only one Smith machine in total and each time I've gone people are doing barbell deadlifts or clean presses right in front of it. As for the other side, they crammed in as many machines as they possibly could. They have about 8-10 hip abduction machines for some reason...no gym needs that many hip abduction machines. I still can't get over how little room there is on both sides. Also, every time I've gone there's been a lot of university/college kids just standing around or in groups watching each other workout. The main floor where the treadmills and bikes are kept gets extremely hot because the pool is right next to it. Also, if for some reason you don't bring headphones with you when you workout, there's no music playing in the gym.Also, the stretching areas are basically just two mats side by side, there's pretty much only room for two people and you're so close to each other it's super awkward. There's only two ""areas""; one on the 2nd floor and one on the 4th. The only things I like about the gym is that I can use one of the bikes in the cycling room and there's nobody else in there and they have a super spacious hardwood floor studio room on the 3rd floor that I used to stretch, however there's no mats to use. But it could also be used for cardio (i.e. sprints, agility training, plyometrics, etc.) or skipping rope.I guess it's a decent gym if you just want to go to spin classes, walk on the treadmill, use the hip abductor machines and/or play pickup sports. Other than that, I'd suggest you find another gym to go to."
1633,1,"Equinox membership is a total rip off. The classes are always full and there aren't enough showers in the women's locker room. You have to wait in line to take a shower after a class. Plus there's a theft issue in the locker room. Women steal other women's belongings while in the shower. And Equinox management does NOTHING about it, even though they have security footage. Appalling for a club that charges over $200/month. Join Adelaide Club or Mayfair instead."
1634,2,"This place used to be great - and I would know, I was a member for almost 5 years - but now I would not recommend signing up.  First off, their administrative staff is either not competent or just don't care - dealing with billing, membership options, gift cards or anything similar feels like pulling teeth. Once I was charged $146.75 for a training session I didn't book or actually have and it took two months for a refund. I had to talk to an assistant manager several times and often left voicemails that were never responded to. Secondly, it is getting more and more crowded and every time I workout, I see the membership advisors giving more tours.  Part of this problem was highlighted in another review - there are so many people with trainers on the floor, the amount of bodies is absolutely insane.  Further, some of the newer trainers are disrespectful of those working out by themselves, asking to ""work in"" and then just taking over your equipment.  The final straw for me in this respect was when one trainer set up equipment so close to me I just about had a weight land on my foot.  I understand that your poor client is spending upwards of $130 a session, but that doesn't give you the right to take over the gym.  Third, ""rush hour"" workouts have become untenable unless you are willing to fight for space and deal with an increasingly douchey bro culture.  I am sad to leave but not sure how I can justify $200 a month for what is now a similar vibe to goodlife during peak hours (with the added bonus of dozens of 20 something year old trainers who are probably insta famous)."
1635,3,"Besides for the excellent amenities, I have had a terrible experience with the staff. Breanna in particular was condescending, rude and completely dishonest when it came to keeping her word. PSA to any current or potential gym members, I suggest you ask to deal with a different manager. Such a shame because Equinox is truly a beautiful, clean gym, but the staff are driving it into the ground."
1636,2,"I'm updating my review because I haven't been to this club in months. The Gym doesn't open early enough (it should open at 5 am so people who work can work out before going to work) and it should be open later (perhaps closing at midnight). In addition to the hours not being convenient, the hot yoga classes are always fully booked. They should really add more to the schedule and have them at times people can actually attend with the common 9-5 plus traffic daily grind.None of the high energy group classes start early enough for me to attend and the evening class schedule is not convenient. I just went to sign up for a class that just opened for online scheduling 10 minutes ago and it is already full. This is really ridiculous!Update 3:They gave terrible customer service and really rude employees working at the front desk who don't seem to care about retaining customers, which is what keeps them in business. They constantly send flyers to my house asking me to sign up when I'm already a member (talk about bad advertising) and their front line employees don't care when long time members are fed up with the horrible service and say they are going to cancel their membership. To be successful this gym needs to get all employees in line with their mission. I'm officially looking for a new gym now."
1637,3,"I joined womens fitness @ promenade 1 month ago ....left goodlife for a change.  There are some good instructors and classes but the gym is way too congested...and very cliquey. It is too small for too many women and it is always busy...does not matter if it is during the day or weekend etc. Advanced online reservation of many classes fills up within 5 min. While I am happy they brought new weight machines which were desperately needed .....there is not enough space when a lot of people are working out, talking nearby or when there is a line up of people waiting to get into the class. I have taken a few classes  and there is no space to move which feels unsafe and claustrophobic. So far not impressed and missing my old goodlife which was a far better experience for the 15 years I belonged."
1638,3,"After my experiences with this gym, all I have to say is that the team must be very disorganized. Initially, I wanted to get a membership for me and my mom, so I went to the front desk to ask about memberships. Receptionist was not very helpful and wasn't really in the mood to give an overview of what the gym offers, so later we went home and called the gym to ask about a membership. This time, we talked to someone who seemed to be experienced with memberships and she was quite helpful. She introduced us to a few different options, and I told her I would need a little more time to decide what was right for me. We made an appointment for around 7pm that evening, so I could decide what I wanted before coming in to finalize the deal. She asked us for our credit card information to 'make signing up easier when we got there.' However, that was not what happened at all.Later that evening, around 6 or 7pm, I decided we didn't want to go to this gym after all. Since we hadn't signed anything or even picked a membership option, I simply gave them a phone call to let them know I did not intend to sign up anymore. I spoke with the receptionist, who told me she would tell the person in charge of memberships about my decision. Obviously, I thought the matter was settled.When I received my credit card statement that month, however, I saw that the company had signed me up for two different memberships (I assume this because of multiple charges with different prices) for both me and my mom, without my knowledge or consent. Apparently, the person in charge of my membership had decided that I was as good as signed up (even though I didn't pick an option yet, or sign any paperwork) and the receptionist didn't tell her about my phone call or something. I called the company and was initially told that cancelling a membership would take additional paperwork which I would have to come in sign, which I refused to do since I never signed up for a membership in the first place. I then talked to the manager, who said she would look into it and give me a call back (which she never did). I never got any more word of this matter until I called them, at which point they told me there was a refund cheque for me sitting in their office. The manager did mention that they only did refunds by cheque, which you could pick up or have mailed to you, but I never got any indication that my cheque was ready and my refund was processed. A bit upsetting, but since I got my refund, I wasn't too upset.Nonetheless, I got my credit card statement again and realized they were still charging me. I called them again, and spoke to management, who said she would have to confirm my situation with the person in charge of memberships and call me back (which also didn't happen). Apparently, they had only cancelled the membership for me and not my mother, even though we were under one account and I had indicated that we were both signed up against our will. Went to the gym later and picked up the second refund cheque (which we also weren't notified of). I get my credit card statement this month again, and they're still there. Some kind of 16.45 a month membership that they still didn't refund us for, or discontinue. Called them today but management already went home (which is fair enough, it was 9pm). This whole thing started in November, and still they're charging me for a service I didn't agree to or use. There is no reason they should have started charging me (again, didn't pick an option or sign anything, only indicated interest - why was I even signed up for several memberships??) and there is no reason they should be continuing to charge me. I have talked to them so many times about refunding and discontinuing the memberships, but they fail to respond in an acceptable manner - why don't they cancel everything together, knowing my situation? Why don't they ever indicate to me that my refund is being processed? I know not everyone is around at my whim, but it'd be great if they could tell me what's going on when the manager has spoken with applicable people and checked the files, especially if she indicated to me she would call me back. I'm sure the gym itself is lovely and the people are polite, but there is something wrong with their teamwork and organization.Edit: I spoke to them just now, for the most part they were polite and helpful but U was told they were 'making an exception' for me since I had 'accidentally signed up.' How did I accidentally sign up?? I only called them to ask about membership plans and I hadn't even told the person on the phone which one was right for me. I gave my credit card information because I was told that it would facilitate the sign up process when I got to the gym to finalize the deal, and I called the same evening to tell them I wasn't interested anymore. Would anyone call that 'accidentally signing up'? Shouldn't a sales rep wait until I pick an option and sign forms to sign me up??"
1639,1,"If you find yourself thinking about joining this gym, turn and run the other way!I joined System Fitness last year thinking it would be a great local place I could go to work out and get back in shape. Boy was I wrong! The machines are old, the entire place has a lingering smell of old gym socks, and the mold on the change room floors cannot be ignored.Knowing I had to get out, I called System Fitness to inform them I would not be renewing my membership, and thus effectively severing my ties with the gym, thank god! Or so I thought...The poor administration failed to properly record my cancellation, and charged my credit card for the full yearly rate. This was in August. Some 25 business days later, I have yet to receive a single dollar back (they legally have 20 days to issue refunds) and have yet to receive a consistent date, or story as to when I will.This old, run down gym is coupled with an even more incompetent staff. So take my advice and look elsewhere if you are considering a new gym."
1640,2,"No/Plainte : 1656
Pushy and rude.  Offered me a promotion saying that they even don't need my visa card, u signed a contract for 2 months only, however in small letters it was mention that in case i don't want to continue after the promo period i have to come in person!! Of course no one mention this to me. After 6 month i got a sms from a collector company saying that i have to pay my debt?!? to the gym... I ended up paying as i had no choice. Never again I will be back to this gym, even though I live very close."
1641,1,"I have found everyone of their staff to be kind of rude. The machines are old. They are very pushy with upselling, which I noticed immediately. I've been trying to cancel my membership for a few months now and they keep avoiding me, even though I was told that I could cancel at any time.Avoid this place if you want a good gym experience."
1642,1,"SCAM ALERT!This company is crooked to the fullest extent. STAY AWAY.Although my membership was roughly $30 per month, they started charging my credit card $90 (3 times the agreed upon amount!). When I inquired, they refused to refund the extra charges. I have immediately informed them that they were no longer allowed to charge my card for any amount and to cancel my membership, but they keep charging the card.I filed multiple chargebacks with my credit card company. This has been one giant costly hassle to deal with.Regardless if you like their facilities or not, stay away. Things were going well for over a year until these billing headaches happened. If you read other reviews on the Internet, you'll find that I am not the only one with these issues. What a scam."
1643,1,"Very overprice gym for what it is worth. Quite a process/wait to get anything done when dealing with administration. You normally have to wait 5 business days to get paperwork processed. The fitness trainers their are a bit aggressive to close a sale. The gym itself looks outdated. I advice people who are concerning, DO NOT DO IT! NOT WORTH IT!"
1644,3,"Came in to enquire about promotions. The gym is a total mess, very disorganized, dirty and old looking. Not very new. I haven't used the facilities so can't say much about it. But will discuss a horrible experience. The gym assistant manager or whoever they make you speak to about plans and promotions, was a complete jerk. He tried to body shame me into getting a gym membership kept saying I need to have a goal to lose weight and am I really that happy with my body?!? Sorry even if you don't have skinny super model body, people can still be happy with their bodies and go to the gym. Not everything is about loosing weight and looking good. Not all women need to lose weight or get that ""summer bod"" as he kept suggesting as some people are satisfied with their body. He kept saying how I should prepare for the summer and have a goal or else I'll fail. Again no there doesn't need to be goal to join the gym, not everyone has one. Some people want access and the ability to do some light cardio. I don't think everyone needs to have the ideology they need to get abs and a 6 pack when joining the gym. There are a lot of other reasons. I solely wont be joining the gym due to its body shaming nature and attitude towards women. I will also be sending an email to their corporate headquarters as I doubt this gym even cares. Sure money and referrals might get you that extra bonus every month, but instead scaring people into joining a gym maybe try promoting positivity and health!!"
1645,3,"Poor experience compared to NYC Barry's classes I have been to. Michelle's class lacked clarity, command, and proper instruction/modification for those with injuries. Amenities were beautiful but everything else did not live up to my expectations. I do not recommend Michelle's class and hope that other instructors provide more care for those in their classes especially considering the steep price that we pay for this boutique experience."
1646,3,"This is a beautiful studio, with great amenities and awesome clothing. The smoothie bar is located downstairs and is really expansive. I love that they had a water filter right in the locker room. However, that being said your probably wondering why this is a 1 Star rating. Boutique classes come at a cost- this one was specifically $32 and while you pay for the space and amenities I come for the class. Michelle was the instructor and I began on the floor- we did crunches, v sit ups and lots of toe touches for 10 minutes. I don't know about you but that's an ab workout you can do at home without an instructor present, nothing interesting at all and completely all on your back. She didn't ask once about injuries and with pain in my lower back and knees it became laborious to continue with these movements over and over. I clearly was in pain and kept stopping but wasn't offered any modifications. I also looked around and based on Michelle's instructions most people were confused on when to start a movement for those on the floor and when to end based on her instructions for those on the treadmill. She was unable to keep command or control of the room at all. I hopped on the treadmill and am aware that running due to my PTs instructions is not encouraged at incredibly fast speeds but incline is the best way to go. The woman next to me continued to ask what are we doing? What speed? Because once again Michelle had no command of the room. The 10 minute treadmill work out included a run backwards and sideways. My friend who came with me didn't feel comfortable running backwards and Michelle came over and physically moved her rather than asking her permission. She then went and called me out 4x by saying ""I bet this isn't how they do it NYC"", "" Is this how you workout in NY Taara"" which neither my friend or I found to be funny or necessary as we did not know what was being asked of us due to the lack of command and clarity. Michelle was overall an uninteresting teacher when it came to movements, taking care of injuries or individuals and incredibly condescending in her tone the multiple times she used my name and a comparison to NYC studios. While I do live in NYC and receive incredible classes from expert instructors, the comparison was one she offered but remains to be seen. If you go here make sure you are ready to spend the money, time and energy to put up with this child like behavior."
1647,3,"OMG my legs were jelly after my first few classes. This place is no joke! Everyone is super fit at this place and it can be very intimidating at first. Inside the room the red lightning, dark mood and loud music feels like a club which is a great vibe. The workout is intense, lots of running which I personally don't like but after a few classes you do see yourself improve and gets slightly easier. The instructors do push and encourage but the first few classes are confusing, I didn't know the exercises and no one comes to help or instruct you on how to do it properly which is very discouraging. The women's change room is quite small and after work classes are packed, I can't even enjoy the nice amenities they have. But the cooling towels at the end of each workout is great. The classes are not cheap at all so I haven't been back but I can see how these workouts can be very effective. The smoothies at the bottom are amazing so delicious but again not cheap!"
1648,2,"I'm giving this gym a bad review because of the horrible customer service I just experienced. I travel in and out of town for work.  I'm never in town for more than a month at a time, but I still fork over the $72 monthly fee because it's a lot cheaper than paying the $15 day drop in fee.I went in to work out at 6:30 pm on a Sunday.  Unfortunately, my previous pass had expired but I was intending on renewing.  The guy ""working"" the front, (Daniel) would not let me pay for a new pass because he was not authorized to do so.  Fair enough.  I asked him if I could leave him cash for the day fee or if he would leave a note for the sales associate, that I would be coming in on Monday to pay for a membership.  He refused that suggestion as well and told me to leave. Technically, he was doing his Job, but there is some grey area here.  He could have recognized that I've paid my dues in the past and I had money in hand willing to pay for another membership.  Sometimes great customer service goes outside of the box in order to keep the customer coming back.   Moral of the story, I'm no longer going to that gym to renew my membership.  The way Daniel dealt with the situation has left a bad taste in my mouth and I'd rather take my business elsewhere."
1649,1,"wow,  sadly i had a really negative experience with this gym.  i wanted to like it, i signed up in november and by january i realized i just wasn't using it enough to justify the cost of the monthly membership.  I figured I would cancel my membership and sign up again if anything changed.  The cancellation process completely changed my mind . . . unless you want a gym membership for life, or don't mind spending ridiculous amounts of time on the phone and writing emails, don't go here.I called the gym to cancel, they informed me that I was going to have to call another company that handles their memberships for them, wtf? i signed up with you, gave you my cc # and you're passing all that information to someone else? I called the number the girl gave me and sat on hold for just over 30 mins (timed on the phone).  Finally a person picked up and gave me hardcore attitude before telling me I couldn't cancel over the phone, that I had to write an email.  I wrote the email and then waited 11 days for a response.  Finally I got an email back saying that i needed to call them again because there was a problem with my account.  Apparently they hadn't been recieving payments from my visa and hadn't bothered contacting me about it.  So for three months my fees had been building and they hadn't bothered with a letter or a phone call.  After way to much time and money I'm finally out but I will not be going back to that gym.  Its disapointing, if the cancellation process had been straightforward I would have been way more positive about them."
1650,3,"Pros:1) Great location:  Very close to Dundas West station and Roncesvalles.2) Good hours:  They're actually a 24 hour gym if you want to buy their extra security card for about $30.3) Month to month membership:  I refuse to sign a gym contract.  And I'm leaning in the direction of avoiding cell phone and other contracts as much as possible.  Other than guaranteeing the gym owner some financial security, I don't see how a membership benefits me at all.  So, I'm grateful they offer $50/month memberships without commitment.Cons:1) Cleanliness: My main issue with this gym is that it's a bit dirty. There never seems to be enough spray bottles to clean the machines with.  During cold and flu season especially, good sanitation is very important.  It's difficult to keep the equipment clean if the bottles are always missing or empty.  I have asked  the employees (who seem overly busy checking their hotmail)  almost every time I go, and they'll refill them when asked, but otherwise never.  I've also talked to management about it, but it's still not done well. 2) Lack of Washrooms:  Only one washroom for men, one for women.  When the gym is busy, there can easily be upto 20+ people working out. This might not seem like a big deal, but when I work out I like to drink alot of water.  I think having only one (filthy) toilet for each change room is totally inadequate.3) Not enough Cardio equipment:  They have four treadmills, which are almost always busy.  Maybe 10 elliptical machines.  A few bikes.  If I ever opened a gym, I would have at least 60% of the space filled with cardio and maybe 40% weights.  This place is more like 75% weights 25% cardio.Overall impression:This is not the nicest gym I've been to by any stretch but it does serve a purpose.  If they improved on the overall cleanliness and sanitation, as well as put in a bit more cardio equipment, this could be a great gym. The location is the best part for me as it's literally 2 minutes from my home.  My biggest problem with working out in the past has always been 'getting there.'  If you've worked all day, and then have to take a bus or something to get to the gym, it's easy to skip it and go straight home.  But if the gym is near your home, you can go whenever you want. I love the month-to-month membership, but the quality of the gym has me questioning whether I'll keep coming."
1651,3,"I would suggest Goodlife creates some kind of PSA for this gym. I go to 3 other locations but this gym maybe needs some posters around the gym about having manners. The amount of rude, grabby, pushy people at this gym is absurd. I get that it's frustrating when this location is crowded beyond any gym should ever be, but please have some manners. If someone is on your machine, do something else and come back. It is rude, elitist and uncomfortable to interrupt someone working out and asking ""how many sets you have"" and then receiving a dirty look when you say how many you in fact have. One time someone literally SAT beside me and watched me until I got off. So posters or some kind of social media PSA would be nice. Sharing equipment, respecting space, being polite, and having manners. We can't help that this gym is crowded while it's in proximity. (Also, I'm not ignoring the fact that it's the liberty village crowd of people who are used to getting what they want). Please fix this gym, trying to stay motivated in fitness is tough enough. Way too crowded. They need to limit amount of people allowed in, I can never get a squat rack or a machine. Mostly just pretentious, privileged Liberty Village people in designer clothes, makeup, hair gel socializing and on their phones. Even when I'm on a machine, someone disturbs me and asks ""how many sets you got left"" I got plenty left boo, go find another machine! There are other options you can use in the meantime for the same body part. PLEASE don't do this anywhere, it's annoying, elitist and rude! Free parking for two hours is nice and the natural light is good. Small gym though."
1652,3,"I've been a member here since it opened and if another gym opened up in the area I'd be gone in a second. In the last couple of years this place has gone to crap. The maintenance of the equipment is horrendous, especially the cardio machines. The membership is so fed up with this.  I go to many other GoodLife gyms and this is the only one that CONSISTENTLY has this problem, it's a common topic amongst members.  If you use the step-mills you can guarantee that half of them are broken.   Even the elevators are broken 70 percent of the time.  I'm happy taking the stairs but it is a maze of multiple staircases to get from P2 up to the second floor.  This is a building issue but you'd think a tenant that occupies the entire second floor would lean on them to fix this issue. Also, why does the person behind the desk have to pick up the laser scanner and ""help"" you scan in? It turns into a dance of a missed hi-five. I'm perfectly capable of scanning my barcode when you're not there."
1653,1,"HORRIBLE EVERYTHING.These flaming morons got our payment options wrong the and even after wasting our time during multiple occasions, has now emailed to threaten legal action.  Let it be known that they have been automatically withdrawing from our account regularly and we have never been behind on this.  I will not let this go.  Let me just add there's a PT there named Brian who I had for my personal trainer consultation upon signing up and I was so angry with him.  He pretended to evaluate me and my fitness levels with incorrect nutritional advice and then proceeded to harshly judge me for my personal choices such as drinking more than he would personally like.  I understand he just wants another client, but he was pushy, wasted my time and was insulting beyond reason.  He is a total jerk."
1654,2,"machines. At prime time, there is very little  fresh air. There is a thick coating of dust on the backs of the TVs and some of the machines. The worst thing about this place is that a lot of the clients don't know proper gym etiquette. So often I see, usually males, sitting on machines for up half an hour while playing with their phones. There's a few obvious non bathers as well. People will stand behind you while you use a machine waiting for you to finish instead of either using something else or asking to work in. Worse, I had a huge drawn out incident with a jacked up male, who demanded I get off the leg extension,  and who shouted  ""I'll pull you off that machine if you don't get off it"". This pr--k also stood in front of the machine and jammed it with his legs with his crotch in my face so I couldn't use the machine. It was bad. He repeated this threat of physical violence again  in front of an employee and the employee just stood there and did nothing, he was unable to behave in any way to diffuse the situation. Instead he gave some patronizing comments, all he was concerned about was swearing. The lack of response from the employees who have no capabilities or protocol to deal with overly aggressive males is very dangerous in any gym. If I had my phone with me, I would have called the police.Also odd is that no other gym members looked up from their workout to get involved or report what they had witnessed.There's better and safer places to work out in peace without dealing with out of control jacked up nutbars and useless employees. Even more obscene is that this pr--k was not banned from the gym and when I asked for a reimbursement from management, I was only given half the month back. The entire incident was obscene and I have never dealt with anything like this. It takes the ""community"" right out of community centre."
1655,3,"Left the gym to get a drink during pick up basketball, cellphone and wallet stolen.  Was gone for 1 minute.  I play pickup basketball all over the city and never had any problem, one visit to JCC cost me ~1000 bucks.  Watch your stuff around this place."
1656,3,"The facilities are excellent, clean, and well-maintained by helpful and friendly staff.  I would love to rate MNJCC on a high scale, but their membership policies seem to fly against the rationale of customer retention. I recently moved back to Toronto after living abroad.  After inquiring about re-starting my membership, I was told that there is a $59 enrollment fee!  This is above the $79/month adult rate. I think this is absurd.  I've been gone for only 1.5 years, surely they kept my records for auditing purposes.  The administrative costs for them would be minor.  As a returning customer, why would I tax myself an additional $59 to give them my business?  Unless you plan to keep a perpetual membership at MNJCC, you may want to ask them about their cancellation and account re-opening policies before you sign up!"
1657,3,"So, nowhere on their website do they specify that outside of certain hours the door is locked and that you require a fob. Not until you go downstairs and see a little sign.So you knock on the door, nothing.Call the number, nothingSo I've paid for a pass and can't enter? Not really enthused about that and kinda puts me off going back and trying this again."
1658,3,"Not sure where to start! Have not actually used the gym because it is not accessible and no one is ever in the office!On three occasions I passed by during ""hosted/staffed"" hours, knocked on the door and telephoned as instructed on the signs, and no response.   An hour after one call, I received a callback from a Number that displayed the name Striation 6, from a heavily accented woman who wanted to know who I was because my number came up on her call display. When I provided my name and said I had left a message regarding the gym, she said ""OK"" and then hung up on me.What kind of a gym is this?!"
1659,1,"I agree, that this gym is full of fake reviews and their business model is dependent on selling personal training.  I frequented this gym, and if you're not using personal trainers which are quite expensive, they treat you like a 2nd class citizen.  There is only one cable machine and not a large variety of machines.  Therefore the cable machine is always busy, and the personal trainers have been completely rude to me when I'm using it, because they tell me they are on a time constraint with their client, who obviously takes precedent.  There was one personal trainer who was so rude, she wouldn't let me do my exercises on the cable machine the way I wanted to, and was trying to force me to use one side of it, which was dangerous.  It was incredible.Also, I found it strange that 80% of the clientele that go there use the personal trainers.  This is not a coincidence.  The place can be very loud too, since it's concrete, the sound echoes and sometimes the personal trainers blast the music!  I recommend going to another gym.  I joined the U of T gym where I work, and they aren't built on selling personal training, have way more equipment, and people to help you free of charge.  It's a completely different vibe with free gym trainers that focus on form and technique unlike the personal trainers at Stration 6.  I've just seen them push their clients to do unsafe activities.  There are better options out there with machines that are usually working.  Did I mention the hydraulic pump machines aren't working properly sometimes, so you can't see the weight you are trying to lift/push.   I remember asking 4 people to get that fixed.  There are better options out there for gyms."
1660,1,"Certainly the most pathetic gym I've been into !!!   From many Cities and countries,                                                                    Getting your membership stop because you locked the washroom by accident, and get accused of vandalism for it ! Who got time to vandalize a toilet in a gym ?           No seriously !  Well you already paid for your membership but of course they won't give you any penny back !                                                                                                                              Nice Gym in Toronto that I recommend are.              YMCA, VIVA FITNESS, GOODLIFE, PLANET FITNESS, HARD CANDY, EQUINOX, SNAP OR BLOOR ST FITNESS...)                                                                                 If you wish to have your workout done,                  without getting in an emotional  interfere with the owner herself who's full of emotions toward her washroom.         .                                                                                    Contact number do not answer at the moment try may be next year !                                                                Might be to busy checking after customers if they are using the washroom properly.                                                Owner are washroom attendant also,                                   that save some extra cost.                                     There's only 3 toilet not separate from the shower which mean if 3 people get their shower you must wait 30min before you get the occasion to pee.                            The 7 days free trial hold by Anytime Brand are not available at this location, and they do not inform you on their website but only when you get there !!!                    A waste of time this gym !                                           Studio room and spinning area Can be used only when you join a class.                                                          When you sign a membership it's a 1 year contract only which means big extra cost to cancel if leaving  before 12months !                                                                            Unwelcoming Attitude and lack of integrity make me rate this gym Zero."
1661,3,"I joined when the gym first opened with high hopes knowing they refer to themselves as a ""boutique gym"". That really means that the gym is too small and they pack as many people in as possible. Multiple times I tried to go to the gym during peak hours, I'm flexible with my workout and will take what machine I can get but there were ZERO machines available for cardio OR weights. Turning back around to go home, I stopped wasting my time and joined another more reliable gym. Cancelling is a whole other process. You have to physically write on a piece of paper why you're leaving. They won't accept an email. My brother was at least given a piece of printer paper to write his reason. I was told to leave, write it down, and return the next day.Manager/owner attitude is the worst and most unwelcoming you'll come across. The exact opposite of what you want when going to the gym but typical of what you should expect from a mediocre-low level, outskirts of downtown, calls themselves ""boutique"" gym. She should spend less time on her fake tan, more time on actually running a decent business.Class schedule is terrible, mostly during the day and there isn't a range to be able to try new classes. No information on the website, they say go to their Facebook page and scroll. #helpfulThe only plus is that the machines are nice, if you ever get a chance to use them. That's the most disappointing part of the whole thing."
1662,1,I would like to start off with this franchise provides false advertising. As indicated on their website and on their voice mail you are able to use their seven day trail pass. Upon arrival was told that the trial Pass is not valid at the stockyards location. The manager apologized for the false misleading information and told me she would get the owner to contact me with further information. The owner then contacted me as I explained to her the issues she then abruptly interrupted me tell me that the information is incorrect and that I had called the wrong number. My call log shows the number she had provided me to call back to make sure that her voicemail does not say such a thing. I'm not stupid. If she knows the information incorrect the gym should be honouring their mistake because meAnd four other ladies wasted our time. I definitely do not recommend this establishment due to the lack of unprofessionalism. From my point of view the customer is always right regardless.
1663,2,"My family has been coming here for years as we all live in the King West area and this place has always been busy every time you drive in you're welcomed by someone and it was a great spot until new management arrived.  Today an arrogant and unpleasant person aggressively spoke to us like we were children when we asked to have the usual.  This new manager who reluctantly gave his name, VICK, apparently runs the place now and we aren't surprised there was absolutely no cars = business is slow and we are pretty sure we know why.  Too bad the place had potentially, when someone that rude tries their hand a customer service service oriented job it's bound to fail.  Wouldn't give my business here again."
1664,2,"New ownership means this place is no longer worth your time or money. I encountered a rude employee who used profanity when I asked when a policy change happened that forced him to charge me an additional $75 on top of the silver package for a few dog hairs on the back seat. The employee refused to provide his name, or the name / contact information for the owner. After coming here since moving to Toronto 6 years ago, I'll never go back."
1665,3,"Bait and switch warning. These photos are from after the job was done.  I called in to book an appointment.  I told them that the van was full of dirt and pet hair.  The response was ""no problem, we have a shop vac"". Halfway through cleaning I get a call that it is going to cost more because of the pet hair.  Fair enough, I have a furry dog and he was on one of the seats.  However, the cost was to increase by 60%: an extra $50 on $85.  I said just do the normal job.  The seats didn't even get a once over with the vacuum though.  The vacuum at the coin-op takes the fur off of the seat, I'm sure theirs would make a dent at least.  They didn't so much as touch the back area at all.  I almost drove away without all the stuff that used to be in my various compartments.  I found it all squished in to a bin on their shelves."
1666,1,"This car wash company isn't deserving of 1 star but I felt compelled to share my experience all documented by a video.  I drove into this car wash - I haven't been here in a few years as I live in the west end.  Anna Car Wash as it is known underscores corruption and dishonesty.  Not only did the ""so called"" manager on duty deny that the emblem from my car came off while his crew washed it and as he was trying to glue it back together - he practically threw it at me but accused me of staging this whole drama filled episode.  He is disgusting and it's pathetic how people like this without any moral compass can get away with running a business.  If there is anything I can do short of contacting Marketplace - I absolutely would to let people know how dishonest this troll is."
1667,1,"I wish you could put a ""0"", heck, negative numbers. This is the most appealing, sad, overpriced and horrible carwash I've ever been to, by a stretch. First off, they're very expensive. This is a carwash, not a detailing shop, yet they charge close to $50 for an int/ext wash + a few options (that should be part of the full service they advertise for $25). Those options include such complicated things like drying the rims or vacuuming the interior. Fine, I paid $50 but the car was still dirty and wet in some areas. They were too quick (and not busy, only client there on a cloudy afternoon). They also don't use any professional grade equipment. They are using old dish cloths to dry the car, no windex or cleaning products for the interior windows, dash or plastic surfaces. They don't have an air compressor to remove water from hard-to-reach areas nor do they try to remove bug stains, the list goes on. Oh and they're rude and hostile when you point out that the car isn't cleaned to a customer's satisfaction. Tried speaking to the owner and she said she's been in business for 5 years and never had a complaint. I told her I've been going to carwashes for 20 years almost every week and have never been so unhappy with a wash. I came on to Yelp and realized they have a horrible reputation. You're better leaving your car dirty, will save you a lot of aggravation and money."
1668,3,"Was passing by, saw the car wash and the sign they do interior detailing. Asked one of the guys who was working if they have time to do interior detailing. He told me to go inside and talk to someone 2nd door on the left. I entered the place, it was noisy, saw a guy standing outside the second door, thought maybe a customer looking at his car being washed. Entered the second door, it was an empty workshop with tools, so I exited. As I exited, the same guy who turns out was the owner physically grabbed me and pushed me away, saying ""Who the F are you, and what the F are you doing here?"" Then he told me to get out.That's my experience, evaluate for yourself!"
1669,3,"It's a great place to wash your car for a great deal, but there's virtually no way of contacting the owner for any customer service issues. I forgot my car mats on the clips when I washed my car there last and have been trying to get in touch to see if they found them.   I've called but there's no voicemail and I can't find an email address to send a message to. Has anyone else had the same issue?"
1670,1,"Very poor kept self car wash!!!Water is never warm in the winter so it can remove the dirt, snow and ice on your vehicle easily. As you wash your car water freezes almost instantly. 2 cars to a bay which means one person gets all the spray / dirt sprayed on to you from the other person spraying their car. Owner never there, no contact number to get a hold of owner in case of an emergency!Price has lowered maybe because the lack of customers. Poor lighting, poor water pressure, poor water temperature and poor cleanliness. No customer service!!IF THIS IS WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEND YOUR MONEY, THEN GOOD LUCK !"
1671,2,"I had a horrible experience at this car wash. Found it on Yelp thought I would take advantage of its location while traveling between two events during the January 2018 cold snap, and ended up having a nightmare experience.The cold weather and lack of proper maintenance and oversight resulted in the car wash bays having a solid 10 in of frozen ice on the ground, with huge ruts from the tires of cars and trucks, making it virtually impossible to walk around your car without slipping and falling in between clinging to your dirty wet car.I'm not sure what this car wash is not doing that other car washes do, to maintain ice free wash bays during cold weather, but they should change that practice before someone goes down hard and they have a lawsuit on their hands.Personally I'll take a pass on this business and wash my car safely somewhere else."
1672,1,"WORST SERVICE EVER!!! THESE PEOPLE ARE HORRIBLE!Michael A's review had exactly the same review as mine. There must be some residue on the brushes because when drying they left small scratches on the paint. When inquiring about it to the manager, he told us 'go somewhere else'."
1673,1,"DO NOT GO TO THIS CAR WASH.Today, I took my vehicle (a brand new vehicle for its' first wash) to this wash. They do not use a touchless mechanism for their wash, but more concerning, for the ""pre-wash"" the careless and otherwise uninterested staff use the equivalent of snow brushes to wipe down the front and sides of the car. I began getting concerned when I saw this but based on previous positive reviews I continued. What a mistake this was. The car was not fully cleaned (wheels, rims, were filthy to the point I wiped them with one finger which came up black) but more concerning, this mechanism of cleaning left very small scratches all over the back end of the paint of my new car. I of course indicated this to the manager (Rishi) who outright denied it was possible, and refused to do anything at all really - I now have a $600 bill to detail the car and fix the small scratches that were left on my brand new car.This wash may be fine for those who do not pay much attention to their coat, but if like me you drive an exotic car or have any aftermarket paint (matte, etc.) I would really recommend staying away from this place."
1674,3,Extremely disappointed. $28 car wash which I was happy to pay for interior and exterior. 4 people opened the doors and stuck their head in. Why is my armrest still covered in dust? Watched car before mine get door sills soaped and power washed. No soap on mine. Only passenger side of windows soaped before the car was sent through. If I wasn't in a rush I would have insisted they run the car through again.
1675,3,"Paid $150 for interior detailing and exterior wash.  I was kinda surprised coz the guy told me it will be done in one hour.  What a 'detail'job they did.  I can literally see all those dust in the gaps. Honestly,  I don't see what did I spend $150 on.  It's even worse than a normal in and out car wash."
1676,3,"Decent pricing, good customer service (at times a tad pushy), and very good work done.I needed the interior of my vehicle vacuumed and the rubber mats rinsed. They quote they gave me was reasonable ($40 I believe, conditional on how dirty the interior was), which also included an exterior wash. They ended up charging me an extra $20 as my vehicle's interior was quite dirty, and they had me prepay. Also, I had to pay for parking as they are located in a parking lot, which wasn't ideal. They were also trying to convince me to get my car shampood instead, which I didn't feel was necessary (and insisted a number of times).They did a pretty decent job at cleaning my vehicle, considering they are located in a fairly dark garage. They put all of my stuff from my trunk in a huge garbage bag, and cleaned the trunk as well.All-in-all, I had a pretty good experience if you exclude the fact that I had to pay the parking lot they're located in (no validated parking) as well as the fact that they were pretty pushy in attempt to convince me to get my vehicle shampood. I'd likely return to this venue again, keeping in-mind the extra cost for the parking lot."
1677,3,"I went there for car wash today.  I left two van cleef & arpels bracelets in the ashtray of my car (clearly remembered), and when I come back there was only one in there.  Then I went back and ask them, they were like ""I only see one in there and I put everything in the zip lock, we've got lots of rich customers, we always found stack of cash under seats. If they gonna steal why don't they steal both?"" Things like that. Two bracelets is never separated, it's my problem that I should not left valuable things in my car, but I didn't expect this, I didn't say you were stealing but at least you should try your best to help me find things. They didn't help me ask their staffs and the ""manager"" can't speak for everybody. He told me like that's all we can tell you, there is nothing we can do. So disappointed, and thanks for teaching me a lesson."
1678,1,This place is a complete scam. The person who runs it is very dishonest and they will cancel on the day of. No point booking an appointment as they don't show up.
1679,1,"I am writing in this section as I was unable to find the company's Pickering, Ontario location. I had a very negative experience with the Detailing Knights and quite upset at the lack of professionalism and customer service. I had bought a package from Groupon and tried for an entire week  to contact the company to book an appointment for my car to be detailed. I also left at least 4 messages and no one from DK made any attempts to return my calls. Finally my husband tried going to the Pickering location to try to book an appointment in person, but was instructed that appointments can only be made via phone. At that point, I didn't want to deal with DK any longer. Thankfully I was issued a refund and credit from Groupon after explaining to the Customer Service Rep what had happened. I'm not sure why the company couldn't answer any of my calls or return my messages, but that is no way of running a business. Buyer beware! I am certain that there are much better auto detailing shops out there, much better places than the Detailing Knights."
1680,1,"Booked an appointment with these winners to have my car cleaned the day before my wedding, as we were to use the car for the wedding. Made all the arrangements i.e. Time, price, package etc. They never even bothered to show up. No call, no explanation, nothing. If you want a reliable and courteous car detailing company, this is absolutely not it! Look elsewhere! These ppl are a disgrace!I'd put 0 stars but I'm not sure that's an option."
1681,1,"The only reason why I am even giving this place a 1 star was the fact that they cleaned my car well and when I came back to complain that my trunk was not properly cleaned, they cleaned it up for me. The problem that I have with Parkview is THEFT!  Definitely, it is my stupidity that I left my $500 brand new Gucci sunglasses in the armrest. But you would like to think that since these guys have a reputation to uphold and business to run, they would monitor and control potential theft issues. I am writing this review after 3 months from my visit because I wanted to be sure that the sunglasses were truly stolen.  They were brand new.  I remember exactly where I had put them and after 3 months of turning my little 1 bedroom apartment upside down, it is confirmed that they went missing from my visit to Parkview.  I didnt just lose the glasses, i lost the case and box that it came in. To give Johnny credit, when I called back immediately after picking up my car that the sunglasses were missing, although he kinda blew me off, he said that he would look through the video recordings to see if he could catch anything. and he would call me back.  I called him a day later since he never called me back and he said that he watched the video and it did NOT go missing by his guys. I drove to the shop to speak to him directly and he half-assed and walk through the lost and found box to pull out some broken and $1 glasses to show me.  Obviously, you are not going to leave a $500 pair of brand new glasses in the lost and found. i will add that I left a box of Kleenex, a can of gum in the same compartment as the glasses and those also were not put back into my car. Anyways, it's entirely my fault for not taking out all of my valuable belongings out of the car before leaving it at Parkview. I will lastly add that while I showed up the last time to speak to Johnny, a cop car pulls up asking to speak to an employee. Unless you are there with your car while it is getting cleaned or take out every valuable thing in the car, do not come here.PERIOD."
1682,1,"The worst carpet cleaning ever.  Worst customer service ever.  Also goes by PARKVIEW HILLS CAR SPA.  So, I paid to have the  carpets cleaned, which was $25 per carpet.  Very similar to other places I've had my car cleaned at.  I tipped ten bucks.  So, they did the carpets, ten minutes, put the dirty mats back in( they weren't washed, which is fine, I suppose, but indicative of the quality and service) and then gave me back my car.    I went home, took the mats off so that the carpet would dry.   Typically, one would have paper mats over the carpet until dry, but, no problem. The next day I went down and looked at the carpet.  I took two pictures.  I brought the car back.  I'm told that I got the spot wash, not a steam clean, and that I should have got the steam clean. Umm.   Keep in mind, I get my carpets done each year, I've never had any issues or complaints and they've always come out perfectly, smelling like flowers..  This year, the carpet was dirtier than when I brought it in, and still smelled.  It's mind blowing how this could happen.   I'm like, I brought my car to have the carpets cleaned, you gave me a price and they're not clean.   Told I should have had the stem clean.  I ask what the difference between a spot clean, as he referred to what I had done, and a steam clean.  He said, look, a steam clean is $150, but, here's what I can do, if you want the carpets clean, give me another $100, we'll waive the additional $50 and we'll take care of it.  So, to have two carpets cleaned, they wanted $150.  ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS.  FOR TWO CARPETS!!  I'm a small car.  Im like no, I paid for the carpets to be cleaned, and they're not clean.  I'm polite and am able to convince him, after ten minutes... Oops, I missed the part where he came out with a squirt gun and a rag and attempted to wipe the whatever it is away.  I wasn't having any of that.  I convince him  to rewash.  He's a rude guy, insinuates that I'm taking advantage of them.  As if I don't have anything better to do than try for a second, free wash on carpets that are already clean, apparently .Tells me to stand behind him to see that he's doing it, snotty, as if I'm an asshole for calling him out on it.  Finishes and we exchange more words.  Asks if I'm happy now, I tell him I'll let him know  when it dries.   Next day, less stain, but it's there, more pictures.   Take it back, get the owner and another cleaner to look.   They agree shits fucked.   Car goes in, carpets get washed.  I'll lyk tomorrow.   So, like the imbecile that I am, I brought it in and let one of them back it in.  I didn't notice until I left.  They took the f paint off my bumper.   1000percnt certain.  I took pics, but I cant prove definitively enough to sue, I looked at it before I left and after I got home.  It never occurred to me that this shit hole could get any worse.   They also sprayed my tires with some gloss that I didn't want and ended us spraying it on my panels.  They pay their guys by the car, that's why you get a shit job.  I watched  a guy on a phone rub one hand over a door and call it clean.  The place is f criminal."
1683,1,"Went here twice based on Groupons, with no complaints. however, after the third visit i didn't do a thorough check since i trusted them. later that night (sunday) when i was re-installing my baby seat i noticed my front side carpet mats were missing but not the rear mats. i called the manager that my carpet mats were missing. he called back on tues and put the washer on who claims he never ever saw them. i've never removed them ever, and noticed my rubber mats were screwed in (which i never do cause only the carpet is screwed in). if you look at a past reviewer on google maps, there is evidence that they placed car mats in the wrong car (see honda civic reviewer). they denied taking them and offered resolution of car wash coupons but i never received them. i will not go back. unfortunately it was a convenient place for me to wash my car, but i'll never go back. CHECK ALL YOUR BELONGINGS."
1684,1,"Do not recommend this shitty car wash.Wasted my whole Friday morning here wasted $8 and the machine didn't work. Their boss was here but he was in a ""meeting"", and I waited 15' didnt see noone. After all, do not recommend this car wash. Machine is not working and service is shit."
1685,1,"I have been hear a number of times as I like to keep my car from getting too dirty. Today I cleaned my car inside and out.  When I was putting the car mats back into my car, I realized I failed to rinse one (they are plastic fitted cover mats) that was hanging on the rack.  I asked the man there who identified he worked there if there was a way to quickly rinse this last mat.  He was dismissive and said I had to put $4 to rinse since I didn't put money in while there was still time on the machine.  I indicated I had paid to clean inside and out for my car, but just missed one mat, but he walked away.  I paid $1 for a towel and wiped this down.  As the employee walked by, I said the towel option worked if he wanted as a suggestion for others in the future.  He once again blew me off with a 'phhtt'.  If this is an employee, he should be fired or given customer service training.  If he is the owner, he should be embarrassed - and know I am never coming back and will be bad mouthing this place to all the people I know in the neighbourhood!"
1686,1,"You're a coin-op car wash and your bill changer is out of order?  Seriously? SERIOUSLY?!!!I have no basis of comparison within Toronto but this place is 4 minutes for $3.00 so good or bad deal, I'm not sure.  This is mostly a rip-off to me as I had to spend a minimum of $3 instead of the $1 I wanted to spend just to rinse my car off.  This wash place just has the basic options: rinse, soap, wax, etc.  There's no spot-free rinse, tire shine, engine wash, or anything like that.Boo-urns!"
1687,2,"I just had my car done here. It was and ""in and out "" quickie. When I got home I redid the interior and touched up the exterior. The vacuuming was not satisfactory at all. I would say it was very slap dash. When I called to complain after getting home and realizing what a poor job they did, they told me it was a quickie so just a quick wipe down the middle. And  a quick vacuum job. No apologies, just ""that's your choice not to come back"". I do not own pets and i don't have kids so this car was not that dirty to begin with. I will not be going back and I recommend others find an alternative."
1688,3,"I've been going to this place for years, but I'm fed up with dirty rocker panels that don't get clean even after going around a second time (waiting for 6 cars to get through ahead of me each time), and having paid for the second level of carwash, which supposedly includes under spray (salt, you know) AND spray wax, I saw that for the second time in recent experience, the light-tree doesn't light up that indicates that the wax application is activated. If you complain, the very rude woman on the cash register will yell at you at the top of her lungs, telling me that the light tree is broken. Well fine - the first time - but months later finding it still isn't working, you wonder if the under-spray and wax button just wasn't pushed and you are paying for the second level of service and getting the very basic level (no under-spray & no wax). The drier guys with cloths are very casual, talking to each other, and paying no attention to areas that obviously did't get clean by the automatic system. I asked for a damp towel and worked alongside them to really get my rocker panels clean and bird droppings off the roof. But the attitude of the woman on the cash (apparently the only ""boss"" you can complain to) is very loud and rude and unreceptive to your concerns."
1689,2,"If there were marks for sub par service I would have given this place a negative rating. I should have learnt my lesson when my wife had paid for a ""VIP"" package and had to return to have the job done again. Believing it was a one of situation and being a person that believes in a second chance, decided to have the VIP service. Well, lesson learned... they do not deliver what you pay for. After complaining the owner, then marginally cleaned up a little more but it was by no means worth the money.  That will be the only and last time. I will not be back!"
1690,1,"This is my first time going to this place and my last.  I read the services offered and opted for the ""Super in/out Hand Wash"", The services they offered were not done and they tried to upsell me to the Express Mini-Detail"" which was much more expensive.  I went back the next day to show them what they didn't do and the service was sloppy (quick and dirty).  What a waste of money.  You would think they would take care of a first time customer a little better. Avoid this place and save your money."
1691,3,"I have photos of this...The photos are of: A broken sideview mirror.A filthy dash. Leather seats that were never wiped.A blob of smoothie that my son left less than 24 hours ago.There are dozens of alternatives to this place. Even if you are sitting directly outside of this building, do not go in.I drive a Small SUV. I requested a Express in-and-out $26.I stated to the owner that he can ignore everything that I put in the baby seat, and all of the trunk.The owner asked if I wanted the cup holders cleaned, this of course is the stupidest fucking question. If I could somehow rewind my life back to a moment, I should have taken my keys back right then and there and moved on.If I have to tell you to clean something in the car, and you are in the car cleaning business, then you are a moron.""of course you need to clean that"".He chimes in with ""well that is going to be $10 extra. So lets start adding up this bill. That is $10 + $3 + $26. My bill came to $46. That is $20 more that the advertised price.I got into my car, pleased that the exterior was clean, and frankly I assumed the car was too.Then I noticed that the side view mirror was broken, and a 2 inch by 1 inch piece was broken off. I got out of the car, and called the owner over. I explained that my mirror was broken, he denied this till the cows came home, so I left him to tend to the bovines I skirted past him, walked right  into the cleaning bay. I got to the area that they power-wash the vehicles...I am now looking for a piece of my car. The owner caught up to me to inform me he couldn't have broken it because ""I DIDN'T CLEAN IT. This is the logic of a 9 year old and, WHY? exactly didn't you clean it.Now I am utterly fuming. I look all through my car, THIS IS THE MOST PATHETIC CLEANING JOB ON EARTH. A Sunday school fundraising car wash would do a better job.Here are trusted alternatives to this business:Steeles Car Wash -  2645 Steeles Ave W, North York, ON M3J 2P1 - 4+ starsParkway Car Wash - 2055 Sheppard Ave E, North York, ON M2J 1W6 3+ stars.**as an aside, I had some simple work done to this vehicle at a Mr Lube. One of their staff broken something. By the time the manager stopped apologizing, he had comped the entire job, gave me a free oil change for my next visit and gave me a 10% lifetime discount card. THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE."
1692,3,"I went in because I was across the road getting Krown treatment.  I didn't check the reviews otherwise I never would have stopped.   I wanted my carpets shampooed; it was supposed to be $49.99, but I ended up spending $100 on an ""interior cleaning"".  So, I'm now going downstairs to spend an hour re-doing the interior of my car.  The windows are so bad that it looks like it rained on the inside of my car.  Everything is covered in some kind of film, and there is dirt everywhere left untouched.  Everything wiped has streaks that show only a part was actually wiped.  I'm not certain, but it looks like there is some damage to my seats as well.    I am F-ing pissed."
1693,1,"Worst car wash I have ever had, and attendants all have attitude. I was one of two cars, so not busy, inside was filthy and the guy at the end of the line who is supposed to wipe excess water off gave my windshield one wipe and side doors one wipe and waved me goodbye. I know who owns this place and will tear a strip off them next week, they should be paying me to go."
1694,2,First time at this car wash.  I got the platinum car wash which was $27 + tip.  Total disappointment.  Waiting area is filthy.  They have a two seater bench that nobody wanted to sit on because it looked filthy.  They forgot to vacuum the trunk and didn't wipe down the water around the doors properly leaving trails of water spots.  First and last time here.
1695,2,"I usually go to a fantastic place at Royal York and Bloor.  I was in the area of this car wash and pulled in.  Big mistake.  Big. $24 netted me an experience that was simply atrocious. I was first greeted by a man who noticed I had cashews in the car.  He told me that if his son were there, he'd take them and that he wouldn't even ask.  He'd just take them.  Strike 1.  What else would they simply take out of your car without asking?  The trust issue has already been violated with this one. The so-called inside cleaning resulted in having the debris contained within the front driver's side mat being spilled all over the floor, on the left of the driver's seat.  A filthy rag was also left on my dash.  Strike 2.When the debris spill was noticed by me and had been pointed out, I was told by the guy at the other end who wipes down your car that he does not have a vacuum.  He informed me that if it bothered me(?), I could return to the other side where I had entered to get it vacuumed out.  He then proceeded to wipe down my car while I sat in the car.  Normal enough.  He then opened the passenger side door and started to direct-spray whatever substance that was being misted out of the bottle onto the entire door panel, not even taking care where he was spraying it.  When I asked what it was he was spraying, he told me that it was 'shampoo'.  Interesting.  Any shampoo I ever used usually requires rinsing.  He wiped about a 1/3 of it leaving the rest dripping.  I had to point out and ask that the rest being properly wiped up.  I then noticed that the micro fiber cloths he was using were also filthy.  Those cloths left a streaky mess on the inside of my windows.  I then asked him to stop doing this after the front and rear passenger windows were gummed up.  Who knows what remained on my door panels.The guy then had to comment to me that I seemed upset.  I told him that I  was unhappy with the lack of concern.  He then said to me, ""You are upset.  Come back, don't come back, I don't fucking care"".   I had told him that I could see that he didn't care, and that it was evident from the foul language used towards me without any provocation.  Strike 3.Here is what else you DON'T get for $24:- Dash is not wiped- Insides of windows and windshield are not cleaned - they are made dirty- Staff members that are completely inept where customer service is concerned - Extreme lack of a well run and managed operationAny 5 star or positive reviews that are found online about this place must have been written by the owner/manager.  This place is an absolute joke.  Never again!!  Stay away."
1696,2,I had one free express wash and thought it was a decent basic rinse. But I just went in today and paid for an 8 dollar regular wash which is supposed to have body shampooing. As far as I could tell it was exactly the same as the express wash and cleaned next to NOTHING. There's so much dirt left all over the car and windows. Really disappointing. Won't bother going back there ever again and I'm not that picky.
1697,2,"My review is for the Dog Wash.Being forced to buy tokens from a machine was a pain, especially since the change machine only provide coins, and the token machine only accepts bills... so was forced to buy $20 worth of tokens, but figured can use the extra another time.Then got our 2 dogs all soaped up and ran out of time, no big deal, put in coins for another 15 minutes... but wait, the machine stops accepting the coins at 8, and to start the water it costs 10 tokens... gah!Tried to find some staff at the car wash area to help us, nobody is there.Called the Emergency numbers they list on the wall above the dog wash, no answer, not able to leave a message.  Find another number on the glass door of the dog wash, and man answers, says he will be there in 3 minutes.Another couple stop by wanting to wash their dogs, we tell them we are waiting for someone to fix the machine!  We suggest our usual place, Wash n Go on Dundas West and Scarlett Road... we are wishing we went there instead of trying this place!The guy does show up and after opening up the machine discovers, like we said, it is not accepting more coins... fiddles with internal buttons for a while and then it recognizes the coins and the water starts.  We finish rinsing off the dogs, and the guy says he is going to put a sign on the door saying the dog wash closes at 6... that's nice, we are there at 4 pm!!!  From now on we will return to Wash n Go, because they have staff working on site as long as the laundry part is open...Have no idea what the car wash part is like here, but again, I would rather go to Wash n Go because their set up is better and has more bays for cars.Bye bye Shiny Time..."
1698,3,"I used the coin car wash when I was there. They have 3 bays and not much space to maneuver in. Don't get stuck behind someone slow, because its hard to switch bays once you are inside. While I was waiting I checked out the dog washing bay. It is $10 for 15 minutes. For the price, I would rather wait until I got home.  They have a token machine if you don't have loonies and toonies and tons of those vending machines selling auto related wipes.They also have a machine that you can pay to have your carpet floor mats cleaned. The coin car wash price is $2 per cycle. I think you get 2:40, which is reasonable. I Would like to hear a louder noise that you are almost out of time, so I can add more money. Also, the bays are drive through. This is problematic on days where there is high wind and the water blows back on you. Would have loved to give this place 4 stars, but the long wait time and drive through bays not blocking the wind made then loose a star."
1699,1,"Spent the whole time trying to up-sell me on a carpet shampoo because I wanted to put my new all-season mats in but I persistently said ""no thank you"". When I picked up the car he said he did the shampoo free of charge so I gave him a very generous tip. When I got home I lifted the mats to see that he did not do the shampoo at all, they were still completely salt-stained. Worst business practice I've seen. Pay the extra $5 to GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"
1700,1,"dont go to this location every better save your money and go sumwhere else might be cheap on teambuy and gropon but i swear to you go somewhere else there damaged my 100,000 dollar car broke the mirror scatched the car all in 2hours of cleaning and afterwards lied about it i promise you this for your good goo sumwhere else and there also didnt clean the car well as welll car was still dirty inside and out one of the worst places i have ever been and a blame myself lesson learnt am currently suing them so beware.thank me later."
1701,1,"I bought 2 coupons from Living Social, each at $39! A supposed $145 value!  So if you do the math a saving's of $105.We called to make an appointment and he told us we had to go to the Adelaide location.  We had to go there because they said the one in the Distillery is under construction. To our surprise we had to pay an extra $9 an hour for parking!!!  To get into the area where they are you have to pay the parking.If that wasn't enough then they mention that additional fees apply.  If we want dog hair removed that will be more money, if want it shampooed, more money.  It went on and on!Now who gets their car washed/vacuumed for $145?!!!! Absolutely absurd.  And for that matter who pays $40 plus $9 parking  to get their car vacuumed & washed?!Our car was NOT polished or waxed!  And the vacuuming was just okay.  They call this detailing?! The voucher said Detailed.I normally take my car to get vacuumed & washed for $25 and they do a damn good job!  But I thought this would be great for spring, get my car cleaned, vacuumed extensively, polished, full detailing.  This is not a full detail deal!!!  It's a vacuum & wash and that's it, so save you money and go to a regular car wash.  And don't forget you have to pay for your parking to get to it, cost you an extra $10!!!How can you full detail a car in one hour?!!!!A rip off!!  Don't bother getting their coupon deal, a massive thumbs down!"
1702,3,"When I entered the girl on the cash was busy with her phone texting i said hi, I stood for a few seconds only when  she finished texting she replied.The exterior of the car was good, glass was ok, wiping was ok as well BUT vacuuming was very bad.I went back to the girl and asked if they can vacuum again she replied no problem, but the job wasn't done properly and I told her that this is not clean her answer was you need shampoo, I smiled and I showed her the dirt that could be picked up by the fingers and there was a plastic fork that wasn't touched at all.This not a place to clean your car.Hope the owner do something about it."
1703,2,"WORST CAR WASH EVER!!!!!  wish I'd checked on here before I took my car there last year to be detailed.Car was left soaking wet inside and 3 days later it was still soaking wet and stinking of soap.  Took it to a friend who owns a used car lot for help and he spent 2 hours trying to get the soap out of the carpet.  Eventually had to completely replace the carpet, as we could never get all the soap out.When I complained to the owner, he not only wasn't interested, he was downright nasty.  I now have my car properly detailed at a place in Scarborough that my mechanic recommended."
1704,2,"I asked for the best, I paid and tipped before reviewing the final results. I can find a junkie on the streets who would do a better job for my 60$. Silver Star will never see me again nor my staff. Silver Star deserves a F-rating, for a below satisfy service. Casual Salon."
1705,1,"What a seedy-looking place. The only clean and modern feature is the machine that takes your payment. The brushes are filthy. I paid an extra $4 to wash the bottom of the car, but by the time I exited I suspected the it would be dry. Guess what? It was. No one should trust these guys with credit card info, and no one should get any kind of pass here."
1706,2,"This car wash just did a major upgrade and now offer unlimited daily car washes at a monthly fee.I signed up for it, and they put the barcode sticker on my windshield (for automated entry) and charge my credit card on a monthly basis.Every time I go in for a wash, their automated car wash system says my sticker is invalid. I talked to the attendant about that, and he said ""the boss"" is on vacation and didn't set up the system yet properly.Now every time I go there for my unlimited wash I have to get out of my vehicle and argue with them to open the gate and they always ask for my receipt(which I never got).Why take people's money if your system  isn't up and running properly?The staff here are very unprofessional and have no idea how to deal with customers. Im sick and tired of dealing with this everytime I go there, so I told them I want to cancel my membership. I was told I have to wait for their boss to come back ."
1707,2,"Stopped here to get my car washed and specifically wanted a wax application to protect it over the winter months.The carwash is also a full service gas station. The guys working there were less than helpful. Their english wasn't great, plus the guy mumbled all his responses to me, repeating the same words every time. I asked several times if they had a premium car wash with wax and they nodded their heads many times and gestured for me to drive around to the back of the line. The carwash is advertised as $6 but I paid $10 thinking I was getting the 'Executive wash'. When it came to be my turn I asked 'which wash includes wax?' The guys response was '$10.' That's a price, not an answer to my question. I could only assume he meant that the $10 Executive wash includes a wax. The sign was vague. I asked for clarification saying 'So, the executive wash includes a wax?' He responded '$10, yes'. Figuring I was getting no where, I just gave him $10 and he put a receipt on windshield without saying anything. Then another guy standing by the entrance of the wash gestured for me to pull forward. He hosed off the windshield and hood of the car, including the receipt that was stuck on to the hood, without looking at it. Why would the first guy stick the receipt under my wiper if the second guy is only going to blast it off with a hose? The wash I received seemed like the exact same wash that every other car was getting, even though those cars bought the $6 wash. There was no wax application. Just a basic touch wash.I did get a coin for 5mins of vacuuming with my wash. They have 4 vacuum stations near the entrance just west of Dufferin and like all good gas stations, 2 are always broken. That's probably all this place is good for. My parents recently informed me that he took his car for a wash there and the sponge machine tore off one of the rubber liners on the roof. Now he has to take it to the dealership for repairs. I wouldn't return here. There's a DIY wash at the Shell station to the west and an Esso wash on Davenport, just south of Dupont."
1708,3,"Way overrated!We have used in&out for our move last month. Very nice guys but frankly, that's not enough.., we were looking for professional movers to move us from our old home to our new home, and we were disappointed.It started wrong when they came in about an hour late.., then they were just not very professional. Couldn't handle heavy stuff, and tried to dismantle anything they could to avoid moving heavy items (like our elliptical). They were not prepared for our move (we asked a few times before our date if they want to see our house and what needs to be moved upfront, but they kept saying they don't need to see it) and it took them too long.The only positive I have to say is that they were super nice!, unfortunately this is not what we needed, we needed good movers..Update:So the owner is claiming this is a fake review..?, so I'm attaching a picture of their truck loading our stuff in our driveway. If you zoom to the left you can see that it says In&Out (the picture was taken to send to our family when we moved, not for putting here, so it didn't capture the name properly, but it is easily seen and the owner can also recognize his license plate on the top left)."
1709,3,"I hired In & Out Movers to pack my place and move across town.  One star is for the great job packing.  They arrived on time, packed everything really well and nothing broke in the move including my many crystal wine glasses!  However I had to provide my own packing materials which was something new for me.  And perhaps using towels, sheets, pillow cases, table cloths and even a woven rug was the reason everything that was packed survived the move.  Be prepared to supply your own if you go with their packing services.One star is for the guys who packed me and moved me the next day.  They were professional and personable and made the move very easy and did I mention their great packing skills?However I cannot give a star for their customer service.  After I booked the reservation  I repeatedly asked Tony for a formal quote in writing.  Not only did I not receive one, he never responded to my phone calls or emails.  It got to the point two days before my move I called to ask if I was going to receive their services.  After the move I called and emailed again to complain about how the movers handled the disassembly and assembly of my beds, to give them the benefit of resolving this before my review and I've not received any communication from either my message or email.  Which leads to why another star was removed. My expectations were not managed in regards to what to expect the day of the move.  I was told by Tony that there would be a three man crew during my move: two to do the moving and one to do the disassembly/ assembly of my two beds and shelving unit.  This would expedite the move and keep costs low.  This didn't happen.  Only two guys helped me move which led to a longer move out/in process as well as an incomplete job, which led to a bit of a sticker shock when I saw the final bill.This is why I cannot give a third star.  Since there were only two guys - they didn't take their time disassembling my bed frames nor did they complete the assembly of these beds at my new location.  My guest bed is actually broken because instead of taking it completely apart, they tried to move it while still partially assembled.  Granted it was an Ikea bed, but the holes have been stripped, screws and pieces missing, where my former neighbours called and saved the pieces for me to pick up to try to put it back together.  My other bed was only partially assembled with none of the bolts/screws tightened so I had to complete their job.  They said they didn't have the right tools, which I don't want to fault them for but again my expectation was that these guys have plenty of experience with assembling/disassembling furniture both Ikea and not, where they should have a set of Allen wrenches and a ratchet set.  Pretty standard stuff really.  And I understand we were working on a timeline (move had to be done by 2:00) but they arrived at 9 am and if they had that third worker, I don't think there would have been any problems.    Overall, I'm not sure I would use this company again.  For packing, definitely!  But for moving?  Maybe, if I disassemble my own furniture in advance and make sure it's done right.   But they definitely need to work on their customer service."
1710,3,"Not a fan.  That's all I'm going to say, because they reimbursed us for some of their failures.  I haven't found one mover in the last 10 years that I would recommend.  I feel that movers should: wear booties over their shoes, lay down a moving track mat in the doorway, use ALL 3 men to move, not take smoke breaks, disappear, be expeditious, and treat your items with respect.  Somehow, none of these companies seem to know these things, and if they do, don't do it."
1711,3,"I hired My Ninja movers in January. While they were very pleasant people, their skills however were terrible. They were asked to move my bed frame, mattress and dresser from my storage unit. The dresser was still assembled so really just put my king frame together. I should have watched them more closely, boards are missing. I'm assuming their back in my storage unit or on their truck some where. Well last week my support bar broke and so did some slats. I am assuming it broke due to other pieces of my bed frame not being add to act as proper support. Random slats were screwed in all wonky and randomly placed.I'll now have to hire a carpenter to try and fix their mistakes."
1712,1,"These guys are thieves. Be very careful. Seal and count all boxes and belongings both on pick up and delivery. I had a bin of valuables including high end shoes, expensive motorcycle gear and designer purses mysteriously go missing on delivery.  The crew alleged to have delivered everything up to my condo and asked me to sign that the truck was empty while I was in my condo, perhaps I should have been more cautious and gone down to make sure. Lesson learned the hard way. Beware. Would never use again and will warn anyone I can."
1713,1,"Worst experience I've ever had. Would never ever use this company EVER! Massive destruction of my property occurred. TREVOR HAWKINS was dealing with the property he agreed to fix but has not even gotten back to fixing anything. I had tried to reach out for a response and was told to ""stop calling him."" Very irresponsible, only there to take your money. Never to satisfy any customer. Would NOT recommend."
1714,2,"We used El Cheapo before 2 years ago, last time the movers were quick to finish packing all stuff. However, they got lost and took 20 mins ish to come to my new place, even though it was extremely easy from Old Mill along Bloor straight right up to Islington. This time, they came an hour late, NO ""sorry"" or anything at all. I feel that they took slightly longer to pack our stuff. Since we were late, lucky enough we could still use the elevator at a new place but we had to let another person that booked an elevator before us used for their delivery. We ended up waiting for that delivery to finished about 30-40 mins.We ended up paying quite a lot for the service without any discount on how late they were that ruined the whole elevator schedule. Even worse, they broke one of our lamp base, whatever it is not a big deal, we still can use that lamp. I tried to hide it, but I came in and saw that happened.Never again with this company!"
1715,1,"Don't waste your money with these movers, I could have completed the move by myself in less time and less stress.  The day started with the guys arriving over an hour late, and continued with them wasting time watching me move more boxes than them.  They did not care about handling furniture with care and spent more time chatting with other people at the storage facility rather than completing my move. Staff at the storage unit were even baffled by their work ethic and slow speed.  Even if they offered you help for free, please don't take it."
1716,1,"Move on to a different moving company if you value your possessions, time, and energy. I hired them to move a custom piece of cabinetry. I sent them an e-mail with detailed dimensions, weight, and pictures so they could plan it out. I hired three movers because the sections were heavy. They arrived over an hour late and only after I called them over four times and e-mailed them did the driver say they were on their way. One of the 'mover' showed up wearing leather office shoes which was a red flag. They were trying to rush through the simple move even though I was paying by hour. When we got to my house they just wanted to jam it inside and ended up breaking one of the legs of the unit. Which meant that it couldn't be up and was just laying on its side. I have spent hundreds to repair and had to hire the cabinet maker to move it into place. I've spent the last three weeks trying to get in touch with Treigh after submitting my damage claim form and he has gone silent. STAY AWAY."
1717,1,"We moved a couple of weeks ago and used Energy. They provided us with three movers who, at first, were about what I expected out of movers (slow moving, disinterested, careless). As the morning progressed, they started to warm up and I suppose that should have been the first warning.They got into moving things from our bedroom which is where I keep my sneakers. At this point, one of the movers started going on about his sneaker collection only that he doesn't keep his in boxes because that's dumb. Cool, good for you, right? When all was said and done, the move took about 5 hours and we thought everything was good and great and done with. Only the next day when we started organizing everything, we found that there were some items that were not where they were supposed to be.Energy Crew stole from us. As I was moving my sneaker boxes around, two of them felt light and sure enough, the boxes made it over, but the shoes inside were gone. Now, either that mover who was talking his face off is as dumb as he sounds (he played himself) or, one of the other two movers are real smart and recognized that dude was talking waayyyyy too much and stole it to make him look like the one. Also, they stole our drill for good measure, because why not at that point.Furious, I took to emailing the company and got their Director of Sales who couldn't believe that this had happened and promised to do what he could (like search the truck...two days later...because that's where thieves keep the things they stole). Turns out ""whatever he could"" was constant delays in response time, $100 (doesn't even cover one of the pairs of shoes) and, get this, TWO FREE HOURS OFF MY NEXT MOVE WITH ENERGY! ""Hey there, criminals, why don't you come on in and have your pick at the shit you didn't steal from me last time!""I've been posting reviews, replying to strangers on social media who are moving to or in Toronto, contacting their corporate business partners and will be filing a police report, contacting the BBB and am looking into cost comparison for small claims court.All of this to say, NEVER USE Energy Crew. If you're a person who shares missives on Facebook, please feel free to do just that."
1718,1,If I could give this less than 1 star I would. Where to begin... We booked You Move Me on April 1st between the time slot of 12-2PM. It was absolutely critical for the movers to arrive on time due to the condo elevator reservation which was 12-3:15. We called multiple times in advance stressing the importance of a timely arrival and they say they would arrive between 12-12:30 and that they even staffed another mover on the job before ours. By 1 o'clock we received no phone call and resorted to calling the office ourselves and were informed that the job before ours was running late. To fast forward a little bit the movers arrived at 4:30!!!! I cannot even begin to explain how stressful the waiting period was. When they did finally arrive the movers were not uniformed and had the audacity to greet us with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth. After the move was complete we spoke to the manager of the Toronto office regarding a discount for the significant delays and the maximum he offered us a negligible amount and told us that he would speak to the GM to approve a higher discount. I cannot stress enough how stressful it has been dealing with this company. For $500 save your self a headache and get a U-Haul because clearly no one at this company cares. STAY FAR AWAY!
1719,1,"I hate writing bad reviews on Yelp, but here I must join the chorus of negativity about this terrible company. Like others have stated, they seemed very professional on initial contact and when quoting the price for the job. However, on the actual move day, they neglected to bring equipment to pack art, they gave up on pieces of furniture they couldn't easily get down the stairs, and one of the 3 guys had to leave early, leaving the other 2 guys to rush to finish the job. When I got home later in the day, we were in a semi moved out state, obviously not the seamless move we were promised (and quoted). They did return the next day to get the other pieces of furniture/boxes out, but only after much hounding. There was quite a bit of drywall damage and damage to mouldings, which, to their credit, they did offer to fix, but AFTER the first of the month, when we no longer had access to the apartment. They also never brought the much-ballyhooed coffee they promised on their website.They moved us into a much-too-big storage locker, with monthly costs much higher than quoted. We met their operations guy, Dave, who seemed nice enough and promised to reverse the charges until everything was sorted out, but now he has now ghosted us for the past 3 days, adding to our frustration. They also already charged us for moving into our next place, which isn't happening for a couple of months and no way we'd use these guys anyways.  Anyways, we're contesting the credit card charges. I warn against hiring this company in the strongest of terms."
1720,1,Terrible experience!!!!!!!!!!! I hired them to pack my four bedroom home the day before the moving trucks were to arrive to move me. When I arrived home in the evening to inspect the packing I found less then half the house packed. I took photos and sent them to head office asking for a refund and an explanation. I was up until 3 am packing my house and I am now still waiting a month to hear from them regarding what they will do for me. They took the payment on my visa and I have had no refund for a job NOT DONE!! Terrible company shame on them! *the franchise owner is also an owner of 1-800-GOT-JUNK.
1721,3,"If I could give zero stars I would.  Actually, they ended up not moving us at all.  Miracle Movers accepted and processed our deposit May 13 with a scheduled pick-up date of July 24th.  Our house closing date was July 28th so we thought we'd done well to plan ahead and everything was set.  We had no further communication until my husband telephoned them 2 weeks prior to the moving date.  He was told they would be contacting us regarding time of pick-up.  Not hearing from them as the moving date approached, two more phone calls were made and we were again reassured we'd be contacted regarding pick-up time.  On July 19th we were greeted by an email from Miracle Movers -- they were unable to pick-up on July 24th; they were available to pick-up sometime between July 28th and 31st.  This email was not backed up by a phone call.  Their cavalier attitude about changing the date of our move was mind boggling -- this was a move from Victoria BC to Kingston Ontario, and involved the coordination of hotels, planes, trains, and an Airbnb,  not to mention the fact that the house was no longer ours as of July 28th.  Count me naive but I assumed when Miracle Movers accepted our deposit that we had some type of agreement and assurance of service. Our interaction with Miracle Movers was a complete disaster."
1722,1,"WORST MOVERS EVER! The movers were the slowest, slobs, throwing my stuff around without any care. Over 3 hours to load a one bedroom apt. They made me miss the elevator booking slot. When I called their customer service the person threatened to take my belongs away. Stay away!"
1723,1,"The worst moving experience ever (and I moved more than a dozen times in the past 10 years). No miracles here - completely inexperienced, very slow, rude and self-righteous movers. Took 2 movers 4.5 hours just to load (not including unloading) one bedroom apartment. A bunch of friends would have done a better and faster job than these ""professional movers"". When I asked the moving team for packing help, I was responded that I didn't requested packing assistance in advance, so they will not be helping with it. When I ran out of packing tape, they told me that they didn't have any supplies and explained it with ""we have to buy supplies from the company..."" They couldn't disassemble a bed frame, saying that ""they"" don't give us electrical screwdrivers and there are too many screws to remove manually"". Stay away of these ""Miracle Movers"" because you would need a miracle to have a good moving experience."
1724,1,"Please warm the public of this horrific moving company, Troy Transportation, also own Atlanta Van Lines, Kingsway Van Lines, Armour Van Lines, Trilliums Moving and Storage ..They overcharge the clients for weight, returns their belongings smashed or destroyed.  Change the name of the business only to avoid any consequences.  Take no accountability and make a living at conducting business this way.  They do not return calls to the BBB.  Go to Troy Transportation Moving and Storage to read their reviews.  They delivered our belongings with close to $20,000 in damages not to mention the overweight price they charged us and provided no proof of weight.   They are not part of the Canadian Association of Movers!  They should be in jail!!"
1725,1,"***IF YOU ARE THINKING OF USING THIS COMPANY, DON'T!!! My husband and I had the great misfortune of using Trillium to move. Firstly, their initial ""estimate"" that they provide you is not even close to what you will end up paying. I paid several hundred dollars above what I was originally quoted. Just read the other reviews and you'll see this is a trend with this company. Secondly, they damaged our furniture to the point where we cannot use our desk anymore. It's literally broken in half. Our TV stand no longer sits flush. Our dining table is now scratched up. We were offered $30 for all this damage. Thirdly, in order to get a response, we had to get the Better Business Bureau involved, as numerous phone calls and emails went unanswered after waiting almost 2 months for a response. This company's business practices and accountability for damages caused is beyond reprehensible. It's nothing short of disgusting. The only reason I am giving them 1 star is because I can't post without providing some sort of star rating. I would have otherwise given them 0 stars. Please save yourself the headache, money, and stress....find another company."
1726,1,"Their initial estimation is was much much more than the real shipment weight. They don't provide you with the real shipment weight and they charge you based on their initial estimation which is called ""minimum weight/ minimum charge""! they are too DISorganized! They get back to too late! every time you call, someone gives you a different answer about your scheduled and shipment! once they got back to me a week later after calling many times, asking them to please let a person assigned to my account answer my emails!!! They rescheduled my pickup on the same day!!!!! and after calling more than 10times, one month in advanced, asking them to please deliver my items in a time window of 3 hours, they did not! Funny thing! they tell you your shipment was lower than our estimation, but, that is what it is! and we dont EVEN provide you with the actual weight! NEVER EVER move with Trillium!"
1727,1,Terrible company. Expensive item went missing and did not get delivered to our new place ......until after many calls they miraculously found it in the warehouse! Initially accused of lying about the item. Also had a couple of smaller items not show up. And the weirdest of all was the delivery of a foam mattress to our place which we had never seen before.Catalogue your stuff before it gets in their truck. You may not see it again!
1728,1,"Joe the Movers moved our items in our storage locker right to theirs. At time of move our 75lb Marble Art Sculpture was never returned to our new home!  Owner said it walked away!  We had a few items in our storage locker at our condo, when we sold the condo the items in the storage lock went from out storage locker right over to joe's.  I had to let the movers into our storage locker so watched them remove all the items, it was a standard size condo locker.  I saw the items go onto their truck to go over to their storage locker until we moved.  i never visited this locker and left the only key i had with the mover.  Just three days ago we moved into our new home and the movers unloaded our locker at joe's, when they came to deliver everything, the marble sculpture was/is missing.  Owner says they take no responsibility!  PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THESE DISHONEST PEOPLE and COMPANY and never leave expensive items for them to deliver!  You may never get it back, even if you have insurance!!!"
1729,1,"DO NOT HIRE THEM. I've moved once every two years for the past ten years and never had such an issue with a moving company. We used Joe the Mover to move from an apartment in Oakville on the 15th floor to an apartment in Toronto on the ground floor. At first, they showed up and cleared our apartment quietly and patiently and just worked. But then, they took over an hour to show up to the Toronto apartment and we had enough time to leave, get lost, arrive, talk to management about the parking garage, and then we still waited about 20 minutes for them to get there. We figured they just went to get food or something even though we had already seen them take a lunch break but it was fine.But then when they arrived, they smelled of alcohol. We hope the driver wasn't drinking, but really all three of them smelled of alcohol and they acted very rude and impatient. They complained about management not letting them park out front even though there is a mover's entrance, and about the small set of stairs leading up to our hallway (as if we could help that). They yelled at us impatiently from the door about where to put furniture like we were children when we didn't respond immediately (we were walking over to the door to see what it was, we weren't slacking off and even if we were--don't talk to your paying customers like children). Then they started bringing in the boxes (which were very very clearly labelled) and asked if we wanted them in specific rooms or just in one place ""because putting them all over in one place is cheaper and faster"" which clearly shows what he wanted to do. We just told him to drop them all off in the living room because at this point we just wanted them out of our place. But when they began, they were clearly ignoring the very huge and very red FRAGILE labels and were practically throwing the boxes on top of one another. Books on top of glass, plates, etc. Two entire boxes of plates and serving dishes were completely broken, and the boxes looked like they had been dropped from a fair height. And we had wrapped everything up as carefully as possible. We KNOW how to wrap breakables--we have moved about 5 times in 10 years.So we pretty much had to sit and watch them bring the boxes up so we could go and take the fragile ones out of the pile and half of them they were placing upside down. They basically could not care less about doing their job right. And to make matters worse, after a while the alcohol smell got stronger still and their work got even slower. They started to bring up maybe a couple of smaller things every 15-20 minutes. We assumed they were drinking downstairs at the truck where we couldn't see them. At the end, we didn't even tip. They get paid by the hour and could have finished at least 3 hours before they did if they hadn't been complaining and drinking. And when they brought the contract up, they complained about our building again and said that was why it took them so long. Even if the building made things complicated, they were DRINKING. Enough for us to smell it on them. You can't tell me that wouldn't affect your work performance. TL;DR -- Joe the Mover was the absolute WORST company we have ever hired. They were drunk, extremely rude, and ignored every single fragile label on our boxes. They worked slowly and did not care in the slightest about doing the job well. Don't even think about hiring them."
1730,3,"Booked a move from one place to another that's about 10km apart. Booking and confirmation was great. Someone came by to verify the amount of stuff and estimate how many people were needed. Communication throughout was also perfect. That's about it though. We booked two movers but on moving day, 1 person shows up and in hour late. He manages to load the truck himself and then proceeds to take 45 minutes to get to the new place. A second guy shows up, now almost 2 hours after scheduled, and they proceed to unload and move stuff into our place. The move was incredibly sloppy. No care was given with the fellow holding multiple boxes at once and dropping several. One glass item broke (owner blames us for not packing right - except it was in its original box as bought in store). We had to give him a hand on several occasions because of fear that stuff would drop continually. The mover then asks for money based on the total time for 2 movers. I refuse, because only one guy shows up on time. So payment should be for 1 guy for 2 hours and 2 for the rest. I call Mohammed and he straightens it out. Not a great move. The owner has good communication, rectified some issues and helps booking but that's it. The actual move stank."
1731,2,"Booked them in advance for a move. Confirmed 3 times by e-mail & phone. When nobody showed up on the day, I called half an hour later, I was told they have left & on their way.. After 1 hour of no response, I called & was told there was a miscommunication & they are not coming. The receptionist was polite & apologetic, but that did not solve our problems. Last weekend of the month. We had to empty the apt that day anyhow. She gave another movers number, but they looked very uninterested and would not return calls ( Expected as it being a Sunday!!). I googled & managed to find a company ""Last Minute Movers/ EMS Transport/ LMS Movers & in desperation had to hire them, as no other movers were available, it being a month end & weekend. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE FOR US. I had to call the cops & Fire Brigade both because of them. Although Busch did not do the move, they left us hanging on a month end after a confirmed move, which is very unprofessional & unacceptable and we had to go through hell because of them. I would NEVER rely on their service or word again and avoid at all costs in the future.."
1732,1,"DO NOT USE BUSCH MOVERSI contacted them 2 weeks prior to my move to book a time. We confirmed with numerous emails, the last of which made it abundantly clear i expected them at my place at 11:30 on the day of, which is today. Called them one final time to confirm, and guess what, they can't find my booking!!I went through my emails and I definitely DID confirm my booking, so this is absolutely a mistake on their end.Moving is a stressful enough process as is, and this is the LAST thing i need on moving day. Really, really unbelievable.In fairness, Mohammed called me back to offer a free move at another time for their mistake. This didn't help me as I can't move during another window, and had to call other movers in the end, but the gesture was worth something."
1733,1,"You people are terrible.Of course Stefan wanted me to hire three movers. That way I would have to pay three men at $150 an hour. Which would mean that Stefan would be making $450/ hour from me for each hour they worked. This is on top of your transportation costs.Obviously at the absolute most, you would need two professional people to move all of my items. Definitely not three.I think it is outright ridiculous that you wrote me all of this unhelpful information (while knowing my bed frame cannot be disassembled) BEFORE you spring onto me that another client of yours has decided to occupy two days including the date I asked to have booked; August 25th.Now I can see why you have been in business for 20 years....you've been ripping people off.Also when you both came here, you HAD YOUR SHOES ON. Stefan actually walked into my daughter's room with his outdoor shoes on. Seriously? A complete lack of consideration for some else's home and cleanliness.Do not ever come here again.Sincerely,Disappointed*********Below is S and Sons reply to myself via email***********You can have your opinion.To be corrected: -Our 3 men crew is $150.00/hour including the truck and 3 men, not separately to make $450.00/hour!-Your  bed frame can be taken apart, you just refuse to do it. We would not move it otherwise.-We offered and provided free in home estimate and the main reason for the visit is to provide our professional opinion what and how we would do the move. You can have your own opinion on every single topic of the moving process - but we may not agree with it and that is a conflict.You are not our client and we are not your mover - simple as that.Simply because our opinions did not match and we cannot provide you with the service you will be giving a review?! Review for a service that was not rendered and provided?That is real anger!Best of luck again! Anger never helps anybody in anything.*****This is my final reply after her harsh email message to me********The bed frame is an Ikea brand....you cannot disassemble Ikea products. This is widely known.You told me quite specifically that it would be $150 per person. Not $150 for all three people. We had this conversation on the phone.""That is real anger""....seriously this is how you think to speak to the public?You entered my home....I can definitely leave a review. Especially with you entering my home with SHOES ON. I noticed in your poorly written rant reply, you neglected to mention that part.I can leave a bad review for dodging a bullet from a bad company, and also informing other people out there to stay away and not get ripped off. It's not called ""real anger"" (lol) it is called being aware of criminals who want your money....nothing else.I like how you wrote me so angrily and are telling me about ""real anger"". You dropped my services and ASSUMED that I refused to disassemble the bed frame. Did you ask why it cannot be disassembled? No of course not. You just got angry told me off. (or at least you tried to tell me off). My scathing review has been posted online. And that is just the start of it. I will also be posting your harsh reply. Just to make sure that everyone else knows how bad your customer service is on top of everything else."
1734,1,"DO NOT GO NEAR THESE GUYS....THEY ARE CRIMINALS!!!!!They are the worst moving company that we ever used. Gave us a quote for four guys and three only showed up. They were late....needed cash before they started. Then once the truck was loaded they said we needed to pay cash NOW or they were going to unload the whole truck on the street in front of our condo that we were moving from. Broken items, overcharged, inefficient (don't think two of the guys had any previous moving experience) and rude (particularly Nadia who lied through the entire awful experience).I used these guys cause I thought I could save a buck but ended up paying double what Nadia said it would be."
1735,1,"BUYER BEWARE!  This guy was a horror!  If you can find someone else, do it.  Moving is stressful enough.  Add Stefan, the owner of S and Sons Moving, to the mix, and you guarantee yourself the worst move of your life.  He presented us with a low ball quote that didn't represent the real cost of the move and which ballooned on moving day with hidden costs. Over the course of our 4 day move in July, he misled, price- gouged, was rude and insulting to me, wouldn't honour his liability for damages and walked off with packing materials that we owned. Unfortunately, once your move begins, there is virtually nothing you can do except endure his abuse and wait for it to be over."
1736,1,"These lying thieves do nothing but lie and thief!As I read other comments they seem to being doing these kinds of acts as part of their business! I gave a deposit in June of 2018 to have my house hold items moved. They cancelled a couple of times for what ever reason. finally i couldn't wait any longer so I rented a truck and moved them myself from cornwall to Toronto. I had to make at least a couple of trips. Any ways, in the mean time I been after them for my deposit. All they do is lie and give me the run around about the accountant not being there and he will call me or I should call at a certain date and time. I never got any calls and when I called again and again many times. Same run around and lies. I have not gotten my deposit still. This is not about the money which I could of used but the principle. I hate liars and thieves,  and these cowards are both!!!Avoid these cowards or get robbed!!!"
1737,1,"Avoid Skyline if you actually want to move your goods instead of chasing them, losing your deposit and never being able to speak to anyone. From our experience it's hard to say whether this company actually has people and trucks or just someone calling herself Brooke who will take your money.Excuses were offered instead of action, no one showed up and no calls were returned.  Voicemail at the supposed main office in Edmonton was always full and the Toronto office doesn't answer due to purported renovations.  They did not respond to the credit card company or the BBB so why would they respond to a simple customer. Is it a total fraud?  If it walks like a duck..."
1738,1,"A liar company. A person name Andrew gave us  a code for 2000lbs with 1040$. We were both agree with that. We will pay that 2000 lbs event my stuff less than 2000 lbs. they said they would come latest on September 22, 2018, but they delayed 2 weeks after that day.  They said I will have free 5 weeks storage but they don't explain it clearly that they only give free storage since the day they Pickup your stuff at your door, Not the day your stuff arrive to your destination city. They sent me a bill which go up for 1378$ . I called and asked why. they said anything under 2000lbs will be charged different. I said but I already register with 2000lbs package. So I do not understand that. A manager vanessa said: We do not need you to understand anything because it company business. We also do not need anything to make sense or logic for you because that how we are. I told them A sale person name Andrew from their company was confirm with me about the 2000lbs.  And she said I fired this guy and he not working any more. So we do not take any responsibility for what he said . So I tried to tell here then that mean your company such a liar. she cut me off and said I dont have anything to tell you. If you don't sent a payment by today, i will remove your schedule. So this is worth company ever. Please don't ever do any moving with this company because they have worth customer service ever, and try to rob your money ."
1739,1,Is there some way to give negative stars?!? The worst company ever. We booked these movers over a month ago.. on the day of the move we have two elevators booked at two locations.. they first call in and advise they will be an hour late.. then say 2 1/2 late .. we are able to attain a extension on the elevators at our current apartment building. Afterwhich they stop answer our calls and are plain cowards and rude. Please save yourself the hassle.. never ever ever book these guys. Terrible service all around..
1740,1,"Wish I had seen above reviews before booking a move with Metro. Showed up three hours late after we had spent the previous week trying to move up the move ( after they promised we could move up the time with 24 hours in advance). No apologies for this lateness were given at all and when the movers showed up they took their sweet time moving. The lady on the phone told us our move should take 3 hours ( we are students with few possessions) it ended up taking 6 hours....which makes sense be a use they are paid by the hour. Also a sidetone that is less severe but equally annoying was that we were originally quoted quite a low amount for the move, but then they called back later to say they misquoted because the day of our move was a rush day. Again no apologies, overall horrible, unprofessional experience. The testimonials on their website must be all fake. Also they have the worst customer service ever and did not listen to any of our complaints, instead said write an email and maybe we will get back to you in 10-14 days."
1741,3,"At first these movers seemed to be good.  They came on time and started promptly.  That is where the good review would end.These two young guys that showed up were slow.  80% of everything was packed for them, and set out on the main floor, yet what should have taken 1.5 hours to load took 3 hours, and 2 hours to unload.   A total waste of money, frustrating to watch and you would have you think seriously about considering getting another group.   Maybe a group that has a team leader to watch and manage the workers.    Better yet, rent the largest U-Haul, and put on the best BBQ ever for the help you can find, all at the fraction of the cost.  I have never felt so upset to watch a company take advantage of a single mother before in my life.Get the propane tank filled, and find some great steaks....."
1742,1,"Cargo cabbie had moved items for my university student in the past. He, as many students, is moving again. Most items have not changed.I was verbally told on the phone a certain date was booked however another was available for us. I said, great let's book that date. I then booked flights, elevator times in both buildings, signed the new lease to that date selected, etc.  I, received another call stating they cannot insure the glass desk top (they previously moved and insured) or dining glass top. They would need approval from the owner, in which a couple days later I recieved with the estimate I agreed to right away. The very next morning, Kate called to tell me a verbal agreement to a date is not good enough and they booked our day /time to someone else while we were waiting for our estimate that was in hold from their staff. If you cannot commit to a verbal promise you are worth less than the paper your letter head is written on. The owner started this company due to his own stress and bad experience he had while moving and after reading these reviews, I'm not the only one left with that same stress that the basis of this very company was founded. I will never recommend nor use this company again.  I have no means to defend myself after the owner replies, bashing me,my education or comprehension, my character, etc. This is the exact abuse and bullying... and lack of customer service or care this team has offered over the phone. I know see they are only following their leader. To tell me you have 2 days free and I can choose from , is not spending time to help me so I will add.. this is exactly the response you too, will get if you go with this company that absolutely guaranteed my date  and time being I was a ""repeat customer"" * this company lacks integrity, movers  beware."
1743,3,"After 2 voicemails, an email and a quote request, I haven't heard back from them at all. Multiple phone calls were made with no answer. I was going to leave this be, but a company not returning your calls or emails or responding to their quote tool online is simply bad business. I ended up renting a cargo van and picking up the furniture myself."
1744,2,"I am deeply offended with the way cargo cabbie treated me.  I called on a friday needing an immediate move.  Unfortunately by the time they got back to me, I had found someone else that said they could move me so we went ahead and booked them.  Monday morning rolls around and the other movers didn't show up so I called Cargo Cabbie again requesting their assistance.  The man I spoke to was INCREDIBLY rude and basically told me that because I didn't hire him on the Friday, he was not interested in helping me and hung up on me.  I tried calling him back and he would hang up on me whenever I called.  I do not believe that this is the way you treat a potential customer and was very angry to be treated this way after I had done NOTHING wrong.  I will NEVER call them again and have also posted for others not to use them either."
1745,1,"I would give them a negative if I could!  We had everything arranged, elevator booked and up until the message came it seemed that the move was going to be great! Finishing final packing late the night before the move and we get a text message at 11.46 pm (not even a phone call...a text message!!!) The message said they would not be able to move us and ""sorry for the inconvenience"" ...um...Inconvenience?! You're kidding right? It's midnight the day before we are moving and sorry...we aren't coming??? We texted back asking why....texted to ask them to call us...they never responded. We had to book a last minute Uhaul and try and move everything ourselves. Worst worst worst experience ever with a company. Take your business to someone else... don't waste your money or you're just gambling the move will actually happen."
1746,3,"Moving Horror Story! I purchased a groupon for 3 hours of moving service for $200 (yes what a deal!) Everything started off fine, Aleisha politely contacted me asking for some details about the move and informed me that there was a $50 surcharge fee for coming downtown Toronto which I was happy to pay for. The morning of the move she ""texted"" me that someone would be coming between 1:15 and 2:15 which was fine since I had booked my condo elevator between 2pm-4pm which gave us plenty of time to move the contents of my one bedroom apartment. When 2pm came around I was nervous because no one called me, I tried contacting Aleisha by phone and text and I also called Dwight the owner of the truck. I must have called them 2 dozen times as the window for my move was closing quickly. Finally at 4pm Aleisha only texted me back saying she was at her other job and she couldn't talk on the phone and that the truck had broken down. No one called me to let me know that they were not coming! All I received was an apology text saying that they had planned everything but since the truck broke down they couldn't come.. Do these people not understand that pushing back move dates cost people money? I had to push back the close date on my Condo because of this unprofessional company who does not care about its customers and will not even pick up the phone to call you to let you know that they are not coming. I think this must be a small mom and pop operation that needs to learn how to better communicate with its customers... I was very disappointed."
1747,2,"I have used Let's Go Moving Company 3 times now and the last time made me decide not to use this company again!The 1st time I moved (Aug 2016) - it was exceptional service!! 3 men turned up for the price of two, which was great and they came on time!! This move was great! Due to this great 1st time experience - I would use this company again if needed.The 2nd time I moved (Sept 2016) - I had to move in an emergency move due to serious issues with the apartment. I arranged to use this company again - all was great but Dwight & team (one additional guy) turned up 30 mins late without any communication (no email, call, text...NOTHING). Despite this, the move went well!My last move (Oct 30, 2016) - where do I begin? Myself and partner needed items moved from his old place (treadmill, bike and projection TV). Our appointment was scheduled for 12 pm, we arrived at the collection point at 11.55 am - the driver did not turn up until 1.45 pm (1 hour and 45 mins late). I called Dwight 4 times with no luck - went straight to voicemail every time! I emailed Aleisha because I was frustrated that no one called/ emailed me about this delay. Aleisha emailed me saying Dwight is ill and and another driver was coming. If i did not email Aleisha...I would not of heard anything from ANYONE!!When the driver arrived at 1.45 pm - it was only one man!!! WTF!!! Lucky enough my partner was with me because i'm heavily pregnant and would not been able to help!! On the other hand, why would I need to help if I paid for MOVERS?To cut a long story short, I thought I would give these guys a try because they were so good the previous times ii had used them...but never again!!"
1748,1,"DON'T DON'T TRUST THEMThis company is a scam.If there was no star, I would leave that. They didn't show up on my moving date. They agreed to get to my place at 9 am. When I called them at 9:10 to know where they are. Mark Debas told us movers are on the way...at 9.30 a guy called us and wanted to raised the price!!!!! so weird... I agreed cause I was running out of time...I kept calling them for two hours and they kept saying that they will be at my place in 15 minutes but they didn't show up at all...So frustrating. I lost service elevators at both places on that day, had to reschedule everything, had to pay extra for postponing the moving. DON'T DON'T TRUST THEM."
1749,1,"If you care about your belongings, STAY AWAY from this company. Movers arrived 20mins late and said they were never told to come until the same day despite arranging the move with Mark a month in advance.  When movers arrived they asked for cash as deposit and the whole time they were busy talking on the phone instead actually moving.  The service elevator was booked for 3 hrs and we ran out of time as they were so distracted with their phone calls we ended up have to do their job. When we arrived to my new home they realised one of my glass bar shelf was broken. They took pictures and sent them to Mark to advise what happened so we can claim for liability insurance but Mark claims he didn't get the email and had to check with the movers. I personally emailed Mark multiple times as well with proof but he kept pushing back and delaying it. Few days after of unpacking I realised my bar table was also broken due to the move and Mark said I didn't tell them about it so he wouldn't admit fault. Let's just say at the end regardless if you have proof or not he is still going to make you wait and give you no updates.  I'm still waiting for a copy of receipt for tax purposes and I never got it. Worst company ever, take everyone else advise and save yourself this headache."
1750,1,"I made a big mistake by not checking reviews first.  The sequence of events went like this:1) Booked 2 weeks before our moving date2) Didn't receive any confirmation email but had a verbal and text confirmation.3) paid them in cash for $84/hour. The total came to $474 for 5 hours of labour, travel and HST. 4) movers were expected to arrive at 11 am. We were told they got into an accident but the real story was the truck wasn't working and they were 2 hours away. They finally arrived at 4 pm5) the movers were nice and gentle with our furnitures. Also took care of disassembly and assembly. However once they started assembling our bed at our new home, they noticed that they forgot the screws of the bed back at our old place. We asked them to stop at 9pm and gave them less than what they were asking for in cash at $420 because of the forgetfulness and coming very late! They also don't provide any plastic wraps and ""forgot"" to bring boxes as we requested.We personally had to commute an hour to get our screws and had an unmade bed for a week. Not a great experience. Please don't cheap out on your move, especially if you have quality furnitures and valuable items."
1751,1,"DO NOT PARK HERE!! they are scamming everyone. I'm attaching a picture of the sign they have posted with their rates, they charged me 35 dollars for one night and the sign said $25. On my way out I stopped by to see the guy in charge (some chinese guy) and he argued that sign was not correct and it was not valid. He then walked over a pulled out a second sign from the back of the parking lot and said this sign is the right sign. Two of us (another customer and I) asked him how can he expect us to pay the rates on the second sign when all that was posted is the first sign. He said he doesn't care, this is the way it is and he is not going to honour the first posted and installed sign. He said I can call the police, break the gate if I want but the only way out was to pay the 35 dollars. At this point I told him his company is scamming everyone and they know it. He said it is what it is, all I can do is escalate it to the management office when they open on Monday. There was a more patient woman who also explained to him how can he expect us to pay a non posted rate, he then started explaining how the time clock works and too bad it is not his problem, the sign everyone uses to enter is not valid and he doesn't care. I called my credit card company and they will dispute the charge. If I had known it would have cost me 35 I never would have parked here. We stayed less than 24 hours and they scammed us on purpose! DO NOT PARK HERE!!! you will see the first picture is the sign installed and the second sign is the one he brought out from the back."
1752,3,"Decent priced parking, however, the service is super rude. The attendant was not on site, took him 15 minutes to come after I pressed the help button. And then he comes out shouting that the lot is full, even though I had a reservation. I had to argue with him for 5 minutes for him to tell me to use the other entrance. Really awful customer service."
1753,3,"Machine took my money.  When I tried to get help from the ""assistance"" they called me a ""f*cking liar"" because I was the only one that night that has an issue.  Not very friendly service when needed at all!  My family and I went to the Game of Thrones Live Concert event on March 4 2017."
1754,3,"My husband and I paid for monthly parking in Lot 91 in Bremerton, Wa. My car was damaged in a hit and run and we were told the surveillance cameras at that lot were ""non functioning,"" meaning the driver of the hit and run was unable to be found and held liable for the damages sustained to my car. I paid for those damages out of pocket. I had intended to cancel my monthly parking the next month anyway, and when I called to do so, was offered 1/2 off my last month's fee due to the hassle of the hit and run. I was charged for the full month anyway, and that charge has still not been taken care of by Impark. It has been 10 months now since that charge was made to my Impark account. I have been told by Mindy Elkinton, office manager in Seattle, that the charge would be removed three times now in the past 10 months; once in September; once again in December, when we received yet another bill for the charge; and lastly, a few weeks ago when we received a letter from a collections agency. The issue is still not resolved, and I have to call and email Mindy over and over to get any response. Her latest response is that she is waiting to hear from her corporate office. Not only is this a huge waste of my time, but it is now also damaging my credit score."
1755,1,"Impark has the worst customer service ever!  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  I went in for an interview yesterday and I paid for an hour parking at their North York location which was $6.50.   During my interview, I was asked to write an aptitude test, which meant that I needed to extend my parking ticket so I don't get a parking ticket for going over my time.  When I went downstairs, I added another half an hour to my original time for an additional $3.25.  When the ticket printed out, it stated that my ticket is only valid until 4:30pm which was the same time that the original ticket I purchased was for.  In the end, I had to purchase another 1 hour and a half in order to extend the time to an additional hour.  So I basically spent $20 bucks on parking when the flat rate for the whole day was $13.  If I would've known that, I would've just paid the flat rate or bought a ticket for an hour and a half.  I called the Senior Parking Manager at the North York location numerous times, left a voicemail and an email.. no response.  I called the main line at Queens Quay and they kept directing me to different people and phone numbers to call because they can't help me.  Finally after waiting a day and a half, the manager gets back to me and I further explained to him what the situation was and he came back to me and said, ""Sorry I can't do anything about this because you did not purchase the tickets consecutively one after another or you were not charged twice for one transaction.""  On top of that, he basically said to me that it was my own fault for not managing my time correctly and that I can't just ""add time"" to my original ticket and I had to come back right before my ticket validation was expiring in order to put more money into the machine to add more time.  So basically, I should've went for my interview and halfway through my test ask them if I can leave to put more money in my parking meter because I HAVE to put it right before the time expires?  I'm pretty sure if I was parked at a Green P Parking lot, I would've been able to add time to my parking meter and it would've extended my time, rather than having me pay 3 different transaction to add an hour to my parking.  Ridiculous.. Scammers!  I'm sure as a Parking Manager, you would've easily been able to void or refund 1 of the 3 tickets that I purchased by accident as a one-time exception.  From now one, I'm sticking to Green P Parking. @impark #horribleserviceimpark"
1756,3,"$15.00 flat on weekdays $20.00 flat on weekends Cash only. On weekdays you can find parking here comfortably but on weekends it's a disaster. The parking monitoring guys try and squeeze in every single car possibly in the most awkward positions. So, if you happen to be the few earlier parked cars... be prepared to give yourself a good 10minutes before you can find you're car, let alone get it out! The parking guys are pretty friendly and help guide you with parking.Also, there's plenty of foreign luxury cars parked here, so I feel safe that my little Honda-rian Cassandra will be untouched. The location is pretty prime but all the gravel and sand here is disrespectful.Clearly they don't care for the well being of females and possibly some males that wear stiletto's. Boourns. xoxo M."
1757,1,"Terrible service! It's like they are planning to rip you off and take your money. The people who work there use big words and try talking all about the technology so they charge you more. I got a screen protector at this location and 1 week later it started to peel off. I decided to go back and ask if they can do anything or provide me with a new one. They refused to help me and said to call the manufacturer because they don't deal with that.As a service provider you need to help customers!! Because of this incident they lost a customer, have a bad review, and I will spread the word that this business is a rip off!"
1758,2,"Brought my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge here after getting a quote to change the battery.  The emailed quote was for 59 dollars plus tax.I got there and was told that the repair would be $72, a bit more than the quote but I decided to go ahead with the repair.  I was told to come back in about an hour and they should be finished with the repair.  I came back in an hour only to be told that because they didn't have the generic battery in stock that the repair would now cost 90 something dollars.  It makes me wonder why they wouldn't check to make sure you have stock of the battery before you start the repair??Anyway I was asked if I wanted to go ahead with the repair, but I decided against it, due to the inflated price and the fact that an hour of my time had already been wasted. Quoted one price and then the actual price was almost double.  I decided to buy the OEM replacement battery and do the repair myself.  OEM replacement battery $16.17 cents!Really disappointed with my trip to Mobile Klinik... Needless to say it will be my last."
1759,1,"Definitely felt they took advantage of me not being from Canada. Pros: They were open when many weren't (choose the right location), Time for repair. Con: Price, Slightly difficult location to find, and lack of transparency. My experience: I visited CA and cracked my phone while here. My LCD was out and I needed a fast repair. I looked at reviews and chose this place. Once it was completed I paid via a travel credit card (no foreign transaction fees). The reader unusually gave the option of USD or CAD in different amounts - I hadn't seen that anywhere else. I asked the cashier which option meant what. SPECIFICALLY asking am I going to pay less going one way or another. She answered, not at all, mentioning she doesn't know why that machine shows that, but it's the same amount either way. She even suggested I choose USD. Believing her, I pressed USD. Once selected her co-worker added, well, it's actually cheaper pressing CAD. When asked to do it over, I was told that I'd have to buy back my money in USD then sell it in CAD making my end price even more than leaving things as is. There was a lot of back and forth for clarity and fast talk (more money for them than I should have paid ethically), ultimately ending in me walking away. I Definitely felt taken advantage of. For everyone not from Canada, just beware of this place and what happened to me."
1760,1,"If you are reading this review while considering iRepair.ca, then consider yourself really lucky and stay away from this business.  You will save yourself money, time and frustration. Their ""repairs"" create more and new problems. But that is not all, they will also keep the original manufacturer parts, and render your phone or computer unable to be fixed by an authorized repair shop."
1761,3,"I don't think I have ever received such poor service. They failed to fix my iPhone, told me I had a logic board flaw. I went and bought a new phone and as it turns out, it was the battery all along. When I told them, their answer was ""we have nothing to talk about..."" To top it all off, they bent the casing of the device so that when I did get it fixed, they had to repair the case and glue down the screen. Terrible service."
1762,3,"Long story short, I paid $400 to get my MacBook fixed, had to go back 5-6 times over a span of almost 1 year, they kept it about at least a month every time they had it to repair it, ignored my phone calls/emails repeatedly. I basically had no chance to use my MacBook for a good year because they claimed to be fixing it. Honestly, I don't know if they did any work because the existing and new problems keep occurring.They told me they would deliver my MacBook if I wrote a good review even before I could test it out. I can see why they so desperately wanted a good review from glancing over this page - I can't believe I missed these horrible stories here before I went to them. Horrible customer service and technically incompetent."
1763,1,"I went in directly without shopping around after reading the good reviews. this place doesn't have a price list to begin with. I was suspicious but still paid 90 bucks to get him to change my iphone 6s plus screen. the screen flickers when I make calls after the fix so I went bck to fix it 2nd time. it only got worse! my phone freezes at times I cant even swipe to turn it off. it also clicks on icons randomly and I have to shut it down to make it back to normal. dont come to this place. I read the reviews thinking it offers good price and decent quality. in fact, its not at all cheaper than other places and ruins your phone!"
1764,1,"Beware, they scammed me! I had a terrible experience and I ended up reporting them for fraud. They installed a knockoff fake screen, instead of a real one, on my Samsung phone after it shattered. The colour was off, tinted slightly green and very dim, the brightness adjustment didn't even work. On top of that my home button was loose and would get stuck underneath the screen. I had to argue with him for at least 20 minutes until he finally agreed to re-adjust the button and install a new screen that did work.. Unfortunately he didn't have more screens so he told me to return the following day for a working screen. I did just that but the new screen also didn't work and I asked him if it was a real samsung screen and he assured me it was. I then decided to get a second opinion from a nearby spot by Dundas and University, called ""Ming Wireless"". They were able to show me that he installed a fake and faulty screen, as they compared it to the real screens they had. I had them installed the correct screen for me for only $20 more than Tech zone charged and my phone worked perfectly and the colour and brightness was spot on. I went back to Tech zone and the technician admitted it wasn't a real Samsung screen and that he also puts fake screens on laptops and it's no big deal. This is not okay, it's fraud!!  Especially after he previously told me that the screens he installed were real. The red flag was that they only take cash and don't give you receipts,  unless you ask and he'll write the amount you paid on his business card. I should have known then that it was too sketchy to trust... avoid going here unless you want to pay $125 for a phone ""repair"" that you will still have to get done somewhere else afterwards. Also when I was waiting for my phone repair the second time, there were 3 others there complaining that their phones stopped working after his repairs."
1765,3,"Went to buy a headphone jack splitter. Ended up exchanging the item since it didn't work. The new item didnt work either, so I paid more to get a higher quality one. This one naturally didn't work as well, so I went to return it. When I tried to return it, she said she wouldn't give me my tax back for no specified reason. In addition, she shortchanged me $2 as she didn't consider my original purchase."
1766,1,"Why on earth would anyone come here when Game Centre is just down the street? Any time I've gone in there to check the price of something, Game Centre has had it for cheaper. I've never actually seen a customer in there. Even on Boxing Day, their sales pretty much just bumped some prices down to something reasonable. (Speaking of sales, why do they constantly have a big ""SALE"" sign in their window? It's not usually true.) Stay away from here.EDIT: This thing is too long. Long story short, the owner of the store is a homophobe who threatens people who write negative reviews of his horrible store. To the point where I actually filed a complaint with the BBB because he was harassing me and throwing slurs around.Don't shop here. It's run by a crazy person."
1767,3,"I really don't know how these guys have stayed in business.  I've never seen anyone in the store.  Their window displays haven't been changed in a very long time, based on the fact that all of the boxes have been faded by the sun almost beyond recognition.  I've never actually made a purchase here as what ever I'm looking for always seems to be overpriced or they don't carry it."
1768,1,"Went to this place a good month ago. Wanted to sell some used games. Bargained made a deal for store credit.However, once you get store credit, it expires in a month and the games he will sell will be overpriced. Just don't do any business here. There's a game store nearby or just do your shopping with best buy or amazon or even ebay. Just don't go here."
1769,1,"I have filed a complaint with the better business bureau against this place and hope to take it further. I dropped off my tablet on Wednesday evening, I was quoted as takinbfone week to fix. I changed my mind (the tablet was cheap and it wasn't really work the $130 to fix). I tried calling but they had no answering machine and no one answered. I show up the next morning as soon as they open. Even though they have not done any work on the tablet they tell me they won't return it to me until I pay half. I ask them where it says on their website or on the receipt this policy. They tell me, it doesn't because this has never happened before.  The woman also yelled at me when I told her that I didn't like the fact that they have my password and why would they need it anyway when it was just the screen that needed to be replaced. TLDR;They are thieves. Take your business else where!IN RESPONSE TO THE REPLY I RECEIVED:It is not a laptop- it is a chrome book. You should know the difference- it is your profession. And I called several times to cancel the order and no one answered. I doubt you had even ordered the part. You are a scumbag. ""God knows"" Disgusting human life form who steals from people."
1770,3,"Got my iPhone 6 screen replaced here after it cracked from being dropped, cost $124 with a new screen protector and was finished in less than an hour. Worked fine initially but over a couple of days, the touch function got progressively worse. I came back to get it fixed, which was covered under warranty for the initial screen replacement (90 days). When I got it back I was told that I needed to replace the touch IC - even though touch function was completely fine prior to the first screen replacement, and they wanted to charge me around 200 for damages that I can only assume that they caused. At this point my screen wouldn't turn on at all, and my phone was essentially useless. They wanted a couple of days to replace this, and were unable to provide a loaner phone while it was being fixed.I wasn't able to leave my phone there without notice for a couple of days, and was forced to sit around in the shop for 30 minutes without knowing what was going to happen to my phone. I was told that ""the technician won't even talk to me now, he's angry about the phone"", and the sales guy kept having to call his boss to know what to do. Afterwards they gave my phone back to me with a cracked screen - not the original screen I had come in with, but someone else's cracked screen - and the screen was working again in terms of visibility, but the touch function was just as bad if not worse than before. I got a refund but I'm not sure if they have now damaged the touch function on my phone."
1771,1,"The worst place to get your phone fixed. I had to bring my phone back three times and it's still not fixed. My phone now opens apps, changes screens and types messages all by it self!!!! I used to bring my phone here but the mgmt team has changed. The worst thing is they won't give me a refund until the next day because they are saying the owner isn't here to give me back my old cracked screen. They want their malfunctioning screen back and want to put back my broken screen. I don't live downtown and then back and forth with parking is becoming so expensive. This place stay away!"
1772,1,"Rude owner No respect.no signed contacts. No privacy.Unreliable place for you to trust and leave all privacy withthey would take your device and go for a diagnosisand will ""call you about the price"" instead they will fix it without confirming and will always overcharge on top the original agreed upon price.Since the the device is already fixed you are basically forced to pay extra for the service The government should not issue any license to this business.  Scammer !!!! Everyone should be alert."
1773,1,"Good Afternoon Everyone,I don't ever write reviews but I felt the need to write one today as I have never received such terrible service and it disgusts me that anyone else might have to go through the same thing I did.Please please please do not ever go to this phone repair shop! Save yourself the time and money.My first trip with my husband was to fix his microphone as Apple said it was going to be quite expensive, we tried iRepex.However, once arriving we were greeted by the owners wife who was very kind and gave us pricing and let us know we could trust them.We trusted them with $120 worth of microphone repairs and replacing the screen.We agreed to do the iPhone screen and not the after market screen because we wanted it to look good. Upon arriving after 3 hours of them ""fixing"" the phone, we came back and found the screen looked a bit off. We thought, oh.. alright and then went to the desk to pay and he told us the price and how we would like to pay and if everything looks alright. We then mentioned no the screen is not properly placed on the phone. The gentleman then said ""oh yes I was going to tell you, don't worry don't worry. I was going to tell you that because we didn't have the iPhone screen we had to put the after market on today. So I will charge you the $80 now and the extra $40 next time you come back to replace once I get a new iPhone screen shipment."" Of course I was thinking, why did he not tell us before we mentioned it? Strange.So we let it go and my husband went back and he said it would take 30 min next time we came in but it took 1 hour. Understandable, it can take time so no problem with that. But then he gets home and the phone screen does not work on the left hand side at all and sometimes does not work in the middle.At this point I was upset because I have to travel on my only day off past Finch station to visit this repair shop again. I call him Friday to say the phone screen is not working and he tells me it might be because of the battery and to check the health. I said I would but could he fix it and how much would it cost. He said for free and I said okay I will come tomorrow. Fred then agreed for me to come in on Saturday anytime saying he could fix within 30 min. Please note while we were having this phone conversation he would never let me speak and was yelling in my ear.Here comes Saturday and I go to the shop trusting we can get it fixed within 30 min. I show up and there are 2 pairs of people in front of me complaining about the service they received. Yet he offers no discounts or my money back. Then it's my turn and I go to him and ask him if he remembers me and he says yes. I then show him 2 videos of times my husbands phone screen was not working since we got the screen replaced. I also informed him the battery health was 85% and fully functional according to the settings. He told me, ""no actually that is not good. I told him yes it is I already called Apple because I know you would say that"" he said ""okay?"" While giving me a very rude and strange look. He then said okay he would fix it but sorry he doesn't have the parts.That is when I almost lost my mind. I told him you know what, we had a phone call yesterday and this is my 3rd time back due to errors the shop had made. I told him it was ridiculous and he then told me to stop being rude because then he would not fix it for free. He said he would hold the phone for a few days and send to me for free. I didn't trust him anymore and I was blunt and told him he would be getting a bad review. I left upset and will never go back.I WISH I HAD FIXED MY PHONE WITH APPLE TO SAVE MYSELF THE TIME AND TROUBLE. Lesson learned.You might now be thinking, but it's so cheap! But is it worth it to come back 3 times for free to try and fix it after and it doesn't work? NO!!!!At your risk, please think about if it is worth it to go to this shop and experience this for yourself.Thank you for those who took the time to read this review.Have a wonderful day!"
1774,3,"This store location was recommended by others.  I got a broken glass on my Samsung S4.  It costs $100 to replace it.  I returned after more than 2 hours and my phone was ready.  The first observation I found was there was an inch scratch on the newly replaced glass.  So I asked the counter how come it looked like that for a new glass.  She said the store did not carry enough glue for the glass and would be fine if I came back next week. The friendly Korean technician standing there also agreed.The following week after the glue was added, the same scratch was there.  The girl at the counter said it would be like that given $100 was the cheaper way to replace the glass and the scratch was with the LC underneath it.  To have no scratch, both the glass and LC had to be replaced to be perfect.  The broken phone I handed over did not have that scratch, so it was nothing to do with the LC.  She mumbled and explained something that did not make sense.Given money was paid the first time when I got the phone back, what bargain chip did I have on my hand to argue reasonably with them.  On top of the scratch, the phone that was handed back to me the glass screen was extremely dirty as if it was from a warehouse for a long time.  She managed to clean half of the dirt. I was afraid that her way of cleaning would give more scratches on the glass, so I took the phone and away from the store.Not a good customer service.  When problem arises, the store tends not to solve it but hard selling that it is like that - the worst salesmanship.  Maybe the store is good at iPhone and not for Samsung!"
1775,3,"I had a bad experience with this store. I dropped my iPhone and cracked the screen, so I took it to this store for repair. Other than the cracked screen, the phone was working perfectly fine. I was able to use it as normal before giving it to them. The person taking it in also made sure that it was working fine, e.g. it can do phone calls, camera is working, home button is working, and all the tabs are working. They said they can do the repair and I can pick up the phone in 2 hours. 2 hours later, I went back and they said the phone is not ready, and told me to come back later at their closing time at 4 pm. I waited and went back at 4 pm, and this time they tell me that although the screen is fixed, the home button stopped working! They were aware the home button was working fine previously, but somehow, after screen replacement, it no longer works. It's funny they tried to make me pick up my phone in that condition and be done with it. I said the home button issue now is a bigger problem than the screen and you should fix it, and left my phone with them for another day. Next day, they told me they couldn't fix it and there's nothing more they can do. They glued my original cracked screen back on and told me to go to the Apple Store. They handled the situation very poorly and I would not trust them with any valuable electronics. When a problem occurs, you should call your customer and communicate that to them, and proactively offer a solution. Instead I went back to the store 3 times without proper communication from them and no resolution of the problem."
1776,1,"A few years back I dropped off my nokia smartphone off with them because they seemed like the only place that would do it for a decent price, everything worked, fast aswell.Second time going wasn't as pleasant.I brought in my samsung phone to get the screen replaced, finding out they could do it within hours of getting the part I was happy and excited.  I couldn't come the next day so I told them i'd be coming two days later.  Everything was fixed, and everything looked fine, except the phone screen was a lot dimmer.  they said ""that's how the part comes to us"", which was extreme bullshit because you buy your parts from a china warehouse that supplies undermarket replacement parts that don't have the highest quality control.  They didn't install the screen properly and now I have to live with the dimmer screen because they refused to help me at all.  also costed me half the price of getting a new fucking phone.  not cool.Don't expect any perks at this place, they're low quality "" let me google it"" technicians."
1777,1,"FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL FAIL. OK...is that enough? Really, don't go here. There's serious problems.#1. I called about 2 weeks ago, regarding my Nexus S (yes the 4 - 5 year old one), its got a power port (micro usb), I have to bend the chord for it to charge. When I spoke with them by phone. They said, it requires saudering, and yes we can do it, come early, its about an hours work, and its $50.  OK.I took it to them, they thought it was the chord, so $5.00 later we changed the chord. It wasn't. Today I took it back to them for 11am. First they didn't realize it was a sauder job. Thought it was a simple replacement. They didn't even recognize it as a Nexus S. Fail #1. Your in the phone business, I would think you'd know what you were looking at. Next. It was going to take at least 2 hours and would prefer it left over night, WHAT? no..I'm not leaving my phone somewhere, with someone else to have the password.  Fail #2. Next, they said the needed part, they didn't have, nor could they say when it would be available.  Fail #3. Next: The price wasn't $50, it was $60, although I remarked to them I was quoted as $50, and they acknowledged it. But why say its $60, when you've already $50.  Shady Shady Shady. Fail #4. I don't have issues, with pricing, or timeliness, but seriously folks, don't LIE.  Don't say its one thing, then it becomes another.  If you the tech is wrong, bite the bullet. Just saying.Don't bother, don't waste your time.Regards."
1778,3,"An uphill battle ALL the way. Inefficient and unorganized. Brought my iPhone for a screen replacement. I was told it would take a few days since they had to order the screen in. I had to call them at least twice per week to get status and such. Two weeks later they tell me my phone is ready but they changed it to black. What?  My phone was white and they didn't even ask me. I politely asked them to please put it back to white and I will wait another few days. Another week went by and 10 phone calls later my phone was to be ready. I was promised it would be ready the next day, no need to call just come in. I came in.....not ready.  I decided not to get anything done to the phone. When I tried to take my broken screen phone back they apparently lost my battery. Very unprofessional :("
1779,1,"I got my iPhone screen repaired from this place .and I want to share the terrible experience I got.1.they made me come back 3 timesinitially they put white iPhone screen in (my phone is black) because they didn't have black screen and asked me to come back next day to switch itand next day I showed up and they said they didn't order it so I said that's fine I will come back tomorrow and I did. However next day, they said that I said I will come back the day after, not today, which was complete joke, I was upset but I left anyway as I didn't see any point of arguing with them.2.the screen replaced was clearly not genuine and not working properly.I clarified with him several time if the phone screen was genuine and he said yes however, anyone can see a huge difference compared to original one ( Screen is significantly BLURRY and DOES NOT CLICK SO WELL at all).3.the service was absolutely terrible As I mentioned earlier I had to visit 3times, but I already saw 3 people came back and complaining, however the guy is not listening at all, he blamed the clients saying that nothing was his fault. when you get repairing service here you get some kind of ""warranty' however that doesn't really mean anything.Yes, it might seem cheep but it's complete waste of money."
1780,1,"Very disappointing experience. Went to get my phone repaired. The power button wasn't working. That was fixed but inexplicably my wifi and bluetooth won't work now. I went to show them the problem. They weren't open at their posted time. They weren't open a half-hour after their posted time. I waited 45 minutes, nothing. Wasted a day downtown trying to get in to show them the problem with the phone. Later, I called and explained the problem over the phone.  They want to charge me for a second repair. Let me reiterate: There was NO problem with the wifi before they opened my phone. Never! My phone's data shows the wifi was working fine up until the day of the repair. They won't admit to even the possibility of making a mistake. Poor follow up. Poor customer service. Not a good experience at all. I cannot and will not recommend them."
1781,3,"Absolutely horrible service. I remember I walked in one day and the guy in there didn't even acknowledge that I was in the store. Also, I have had good service experience speaking to people in the store when calling in, but also employees that really gave two shits to answer questions. It's a one star rating because of the unpredictability of a positive experience there."
1782,3,"My computer crashed, and they ""fixed"" the problem.  It crashed again two days later.  However the worst part is the level of customer service.  When I picked up my MacBook I tried to ask questions about what had gone wrong.  I got one and two word answers which were not specific or helpful.  I then asked what I could do to prevent a future crash.  I was answered with a bunch of computer jargon that I did not understand.  I tried to ask clarifying questions. No helpful response. When I asked about reloading files and different ways to back up, more computer jargon.  The guy barely made eye contact.  I felt so unwelcome.  Plus, the thing crashed again two days later.  So never go here ever.  It is a terrible feeling when your computer crashes and this company made it worse.  They clearly do not value you as a customer or want you to return to their store."
1783,1,"DO NOT GO HERE!  Brutal service!!!  Owner Nick refuses to respond to emails and provide refund for work not done. I went here before traveling to Mexico (based on a recommendation) BIG mistake! The clerk was new, filled out my work order form wrong - I was VERY clear with what I needed.The Apple store told me I needed a clean re-install and I passed this info on. This was not done. The work they did do had to be redone and 3 employees had to come together to try and sort it out. The owner Nick was there, he assured me that my computer was fine - no hardware or software issues. I am now in Mexico without a working computer and no way to repair it for months. The owner told me I need a new hard drive and to get one ASAP....really?! In a small village in Mexico?! impossible.Nick refuses to answer my emails, provide any solution and refuses to refund me."
1784,3,"I went to the Apple store at Eaton Centre today with a problem concerning my hard drive in my 2012 Macbook Pro. I opened up my laptop to just a grey screen with a folder and a question mark.When I went in to see if any of my data from my hard drive could be recovered (as I have an exam tomorrow and all my notes were on it), I was greeted by a specialist who did a diagnostic on my laptop. He told me that my hard drive was completely damaged and it would be impossible to recover any of my info from the past 4 years. While I was sobbing, he continued to try to convince me to replace my hard drive with them which would cost around $300 with taxes. Not only that, but they said it would take 3-4 days to fix.Well, I just had my father with minimal tech experience open up my laptop and recover my entire hard drive in the span of 4 hours, when I just had one of the Genius Bar specialists tell me that there was nothing that could be done and all of my data was lost forever.I am not only mad that he caused me so much stress for nothing, but he essentially just tried to scam me for $300 over an easily-fixed problem. I really thought I would be able to trust the Apple store with my Apple products but apparently not."
1785,3,"Terrible service and a declining product. The associate charged my account by accident and then could not fix it, telling me to figure it out myself and call customer service. They made the mistake! Apple used to have good customer service, which justified the price paid for the product. Now the products don't last and the service is simply not there. This should be a simple problem to fix but the manager did not seem to care and did not even attempt to rectify the situation."
1786,2,"This review is for Apple in general and their customer service. I just bought a brand new MAC and the newest Iphone ll within a month, and have always been an apple customer, but yesterday I was extremely shocked by the terrible customer service, and also the lack of user friendly technology. I had purchased a song on Itunes, but the song would not show up on my MAC, and only on my iphone. Afterbeing passed through 3 different employees, all who could not figure it out event through screen sharing, the 3rd employee, an hour and a half on the phone later, finally figured out the glitch. After inquiring how I would be compensated for the frustration, I was passed to the senior supervisor, micheal, who told me that Apple soe not even offer something as small as a GC for itunes, or a free month pass to apple music to their customers for any reason because they feel they can not determine what is fair for each individual. I think this is hugely irresponsible of such a large company. I will honestly never buy another apple product again after this experience."
1787,2,"Extremely rude Manager. I called in to inquire about a phone. Jim answered (was told he's the manager). He barely answered my question and hung up on me. I was in disbelief because I had another question and he yelled at me saying they were busy. I asked him what was the problem because the quality of service I was getting was disappointing. He yelled again and hung up on me. I have bought everything electrical that I own at Best Buy. I am so disappointed that I will not be buying anything else from Best Buy. If the manager is so rude, what should I expect."
1788,3,"Very confusing when different associates provide different information.  Purchased a bb couple of years ago and was talked into purchasing an extended warranty.  As a novice bb user at the time, the associate informed me that the trackball has been known to stick and if there are any issues within 2 yrs to just bring back the phone.  Fast forward to over a year later, track ball issues occur but what a pain to change the phone.  Note to staff...insinuating a customer is a liar is not what one would consider good customer service."
1789,2,"This place is chaos in a box. I ended up here as the Best Buy (BB) nearby didn't have the phone I wanted in stock. There was quite a crowd here on my visit. They do have enough staff so it is manageable. Now for the bad part the staff isn't that knowledgeable and surprisingly didn't even know basic stuff in some cases. I had a complicated transaction (mix of rewardzone gift card, normal gift card and Amex) and boy did that put most of them through their paces. The person I dealt with was improper for a lack of better word. Luckily the big box store that stands behind this outpost kinda forces me to buy here otherwise I wouldn't shop here (no questions asked policy goes a long way)A word of advice they do have blaring loud music playing at odd times which is krazy as the place already has music/noise of its own with all the hustle and bustle.I don't think I will come back here unless I have to."
1790,1,"WARNING this man is a scam artist and you can get your cell phones fixed much cheaper  for less than half of what he charges in multiple other places. He didn't even acknowledge me as a customer he was too busy flirting with his receptionist and laughing in the back as he was going through other peoples devices with his buddy. If you want to get ripped off this is the perfect place to go for sure! Did I mention I was spending over 300 dollars in his store without even a hello. I payed 200 dollars to fix the internal screen of a Samsung s4(only internal) talk about being taken advantage of!! And 100 to unlock my I phone. The same phones internal and external parts broke less than a month after he ""fixed"" this. Anyways I payed 120 for both of the screens 20 minutes away in Markham. And they unlock phones for $40 So if you don't mind the drive you can save tons of money. Don't let selfish ignorant people take advantage of you and your hard earned money. Greedy ignorant man. So in satisfied right now!"
1791,1,"Nice of you to try and shift the blame to the customer. My review was truthful and accurate. He had no reason to be in files and folders. When I caught him, I was surprised because it was not supposed to ready for another day. I said ""oh it's ready?"" He said no. That proves he had no business in my device, plus I was there for a home button, why does he need to be in my files and folders for a home button? Is it also my fault for the money? It doesn't matter it's $6 or $60, it's my money, I was being over charged and had to argue with him and teach him how to do his job. How many others get ripped off in your store and don't realize it?"
1792,1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible. I will never do business here again. About a week ago we took in a iphone4 to get the home button repaired. At the same time we took in a iPod touch4, for the same issue. For reasons that do not matter for this review, we had to return to the store to take back the iPod. When we walked in, we caught them NOT repairing our device, but instead going through our settings and folders. Why were they snooping in our device?If I had been thinking, I would have taken our iPhone back as well. My fault, not theirs. Anyways we get a call the next day to come grab our phone as they had finished. We go back over and the owner of the phone tests it all out (since its not my phone, I wouldn't know if its fixed or not) and he says everything seems to be great. So now it's time to pay. The agreed upon price was $40 plus tax. He looks at me and tells me the total price is $52. What? $52? So there's $12 tax on $40? I tell him no, I'm not paying that, his math is wrong. He looks at me funny. I have to tell this guy, who's in business, how to figure out tax. 40 x 1.13 = 45.20, NOT $52. Sad part is, he was not commiting a crime, he was not pulling a fast one. He is simply stupid. I saw it in his face. And stupid is not illegal. If someone ever asks me about this place, I will tell them no. Go somewhere else. Don't go here."
1793,2,"Not the best experience.  My toilet was taking forever to refill, and my condo management told me it was a fill valve issue, and that they use Jermark.  I called them around 530 pm and the woman said someone would call me back the next day.  I happened to have that Thursday off (it was a Monday at the time), so I said I'd like someone to come Thursday, since I was already going to be home.  They give you two choices to show up - 9-12 (three hour window) or 12-5 (a five hour window! WTF!).  Anyway, no one ever phoned me back, so I ended up phoning again (on the Tuesday).  They said at this point Thursday was all booked up.  She said the next available date was the following week, which meant I'd have to take work off, which was super annoying.  She said I could be the first appointment of the day, so the plumber would show up right at 9 am on the following Tuesday.  Annoyed I was going to have a toilet problem for that much longer, I agreed.Well, that Monday night she phones and said they had an emergency and so they were bumping me to a later time.  I didn't really have a choice, but I was super annoyed.  She said they'd be there sometime after 11 am.   And of course - what happens - they phone me at 830 am the next day and say they're on their way.  WHAT.Plumber dude reeked of cigarette smoke, and what I didn't appreciate is his liberal use of my condo - he hung his jacket on my clothes' dryer rack without asking, and then put all his work stuff ON MY STOVE?  So gross.  He was in my condo for a total of 10 minutes including billing, and the charge as $250.  (The part at Home Depot costs like $15)  He was out of my condo BEFORE 9 am when they had kept dicking me around.  Ugh.  Now that I know, I will never use them again.  It would be worth the price MAYBE if the service was good.  Oh, and the plumber used MY tupperware to keep the gross plumbing debris in?  They can't come with some sort of basin to use?"
1794,1,"Scam and bullies!We were quoted $150 for this company to change a water valve in my parents condo kitchen.  My parents are seniors, and the plumber had only worked 30 minutes and gave my parents $459 bill. When we disagreed the amount, they threaten to put a lien on our condo.  They are dishonest bullies.  Do not hire them!"
1795,3,"Tridel owned Del Property management uses them,think about it given this scenario.I was NEVER told I would be billed when I told the property manager about pipe noises.Assistant super.showed up,assessed the backup type noise, coming from the kitchen pipe,NOT clog.Soon after,I get a visit from  HYPERLINK ""https://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FJermark.At&s=f8c49237a1c20840579dfa8ffb8a5f22999b16f860bb11d1e6994d0ecdcc3d21"" \t ""_blank"" Jermark.At the time,Jermark didn't even tell me they would have to bill me because the issue wasn't related to MY unit once the plumber removed the unclogged  drain IN my unit. Called Brothers Plumbing Toronto,Canada whom I've dealt with before without ANY issues. Based on my description of what happened,Brothers Plumbing  explained the work done for my unit involved the ""main vertical"" which is the building pipe for my  section of the building. Thus it's NOT specific to  my unit. To be invoiced,wouldn't Jermark know this,instead they wrote on the invoice I had a plugged drain? Jermark also charged a truck fee,Brothers Plumbing said they don't charge for one unless they get a city issued ticket due to lack of parking at the job site. The Jermark guy who came was actually polite,cleaned up."
1796,3,"I had hardwood flooring installed in the summer of 2012. The price seemed very good, but in hindsight, it was a horrible decision to go with Downtown Flooring. Problems:1. Hardwood is low quality: Don't fall for the marketing. They provide very cheap brands. I used their Torly's brand. The wood scratches so easily. A friend who recommended this brand to me shortly after getting it installed himself also now regrets his decision. I've lived in three houses with hardwood. In a couple of months, the condition of the wood looks worse than after decades at my previous homes. 2. Installation was low-quality:  Sometimes trims were too short. Nails stuck out on trims and were dented/hammered in. Hardwood didn't reach the trim in four cases, which led to a gap showing between the wall and the trim. Very shoddy work on the molding around a pillar. 3. Sub-Contractors were not provided all of the proper pieces for installation: Not enough trim was provided to the installers. This wasted a lot of time, because they had to come back three times. Twice they brought back the wrong trim.  4. Sub-contractors were unreliable: Although the subcontractors came back twice more, they flaked on four occasions. They were only willing to come back if they were working nearby in the neighbourhood, and could drop by when it was convenient for them. Conclusion: Cheap product, they sub-contract their work to unskilled talent to save money, managers don't have attention to detail."
1797,1,My experience with Downtown Flooring (when they installed an expensive hardwood floor in a large area of my home) was the worst I have had with any contactor I have used.  The 2 men who were sent to install the floor had no idea what they were doing.  In the end I had to hire the company I should have chosen for the job to come and fix all the mistakes they made.  Do not hire this company.  I am sure you will be sorry.
1798,1,"I did not end up going with Downtown Flooring after several weeks of planning to. I am a strong advocate for customer service. I will pay a bit extra to the little guy just to have a one on one conversation and discussion about the project. I was very disappointed with the way I was treated by Downtown Flooring. Maybe it was just the one sales guy I was dealing with, but every-time it felt like I was a huge inconvenience to him. Prices a bit higher than most other places. The location was what drew me to them in the first place. Personally I would not recommend Downtown Flooring to anyone."
1799,3,I purchased a deal from Groupon for te Home Improvement People. The deal was for 2 hours of handyman service. I called once a few months ago as I needed some minor plumbing repairs done in my shower. I called the main number to book an appointment however they just tell you somebody will call you back to make an appointment. 2 days later I get a call however I had already repaired it myself as I couldn't wait. I called again this last Tuesday as I wanted my microwave hung under my kitchen cabinets. Again no answer so I left a message. I left a message everyday for 3 days until I finally got a call back. I was told hanging a microwave was a 2 man job and I needed to pay extra for the second person unless I wanted to help.  I said I had no problems helping and I was told someone would contact me to book an appointment. It has been 6 days and I still haven't received a call back and I hired someone else to do the job. Very unprofessional.
1800,2,I contacted this company to provide an estimate for some renovations.  The man they sent out was condescending to say the least and completely unhelpful. He barely spoke and could not convey any more clearly that he was not interested in providing any type of service. I will gladly take my business elsewhere.
1801,2,"Didn't get past the quote.  Terrible service to provide a quote!  I was excited about calling these guys as they are highly rated.  Had to wait 2 weeks for an appointment b/c I needed it to be after 6pm.  On the day of the appt, they call me at 6 saying they are running late.  Fine, my husband was waiting anyway.  They call again close to 7 asking if we still want them to come - of course, we are waiting!  The person, Ben (who seems to be one of the owners), clearly does NOT want to come.  Comes in, complains about the dogs, says what we want can't be done (yes it can, my neighbor got it done in an identical house!) barely asks any questions and says it is going to cost 15k.  We have 2 bathrooms to renovate, based on this attitude, we don't even want them to ""quote"" the 2nd bathroom.  Leaves without even closing the gate.If this is how they behave trying to win business, I can't imagine how it is while doing business.I you don't want to take a small job, don't waste my time!Very disappointed!"
1802,1,"This has to be the absolute worst company you could hire! I honestly and truthfully don't even know where to begin..If you are looking to have you're job destroyed, money and time wasted, and have CRACK smoked ON SITE! Then Dustin and the boys are who you want! This company is a total joke, A&R contracting should be ashamed to be associated with Dustin and there crew. I would suggest any other company then iconic steel cladding for any project."
1803,3,"Still no word from Treeium regarding our last two posts of work under the warranty that has not been fixed. As posted previously, our kitchen remodel took over a year and four months to complete a small project. Was a horrendous nightmare to have the loss of both kitchen and family room that long for a normal three month project we were promised. They have had to fix things twice in two years, now we are having issues with workmanship again that is rearing its ugly head! I notice the poor reviews are quickly buried and old ones like November are popping up, hmmm..."
1804,1,"This company was hired to install a steel roof on a house for us. The first red flag we received was that the steel was improperly fastened, which was later confirmed through the steel manufacturer. Dustin constantly lied to us about showing up, sometimes he wouldn’t show up for weeks at time, which in turn delayed the progress of the project. Ladders were left leaning up against the house unsecured, for days/weeks at a time. On several occasions we had to re-secure the thousands of dollars of steel roofing that was laying on the ground, unsecured which had blown across the jobsite (damaging several pieces). I would highly recommend hiring another company, just downright poor workmanship all around."
1805,1,"WARNING-- Stay away from Sam at GTA Bathtub & Tile Reglazing 647-783-3430.Sam also seems to go under the name: FRIMIS ENTERPRISE.He messed up my bathtub twice in a row.I am now left with a big chunk of paint peeled on the edge of my tub that I have to see every time I take a shower. And it burns me every time.How irritating is that?In his first attempt, he left the tub with about 25 runs of paint all over the tub.I was impressed at first when he agreed to re-due it. but at this point I would have rather lived with the runs... Read on...When he came back the second time, the job looked ok at first, but the entire tub was still tapped off from the spray paint.Sam said ""you can pull the tape of in a couple of hours""I said ""Are you sure, I would rather you do it, I dont want it to peel the new paint""Sam said ""that's not going to happen, dont worry about that""He then left handing me a sheet of paper claiming a ""5 year warranty""Sure enough a couple hours later I came back home and peeled the tape off as slowly and carefully as I could, and sure enough, it peeled.Then I took a closer look around and notice that he got paint everywhere.My brand new scale is speckled in paint.The tile floor has over-spray all over.The spout has paint all over it.And to top it off... there is a 5 inch circle of chemical damage to my newly refinished floor in the hall just outside the washroom!!I called him right away.. He asked me to email him pictures.. I did..Since then he has ignored my calls and not returned my voice mails. (about a week)Until today when I took a shot and called from a friends phone. He answered right away!But he got immediately defensive and was reacting like a child who will not take responsibility and tried to put the blame on me.Here is what I am left with.Link to pictures:The peel in the tub:flickr.com/photos/benkay…The damage to my new floor:flickr.com/photos/benkay…And a close up to show his lousy work in general:"
1806,3,"NEW NUMBER: 647 772 37266477723726 Rude & bad workmanship. I hired them to do a bathtub chip repair. They completed the rushed job in 10-15 mins max. He put the putty in and rush to sand it and it came off twice and eventually it stuck and then did multiple layers of spray paint on it in 2 minutes. After first use, all the paint peeled off and flaked. I let SAM and GEORGE know and was told they will fix it.For 5 weeks, they kept saying they will fix it but all a sudden they called and rudely accused me.Never fixed it."
1807,1,"I can not recomend using Sam from GTA Bathtub and Tile Reglazing - 647-783-3430He had to reglaze my bathtub. After his first try he managed to use so much paint that there were 36 paint runs and a puddle of paint in the bottom of the bathtub. I commented on this right away and he said; ""don´t worry its normal it will even out in a couple of days when its dry!!!"" Really???!After he left the first time I found paint on my new wall tiles and on my new floor. On top of that he also managed to get paint on my hardwood floor outside the bathroom. So I had to clean up his mess. I called him back and he agreed to come and redo the paintjob. This time I was prepared and had most of my bathroom covered with dropsheets so he could not make another mess in there. He refinished the bathtub and it came out better second time. Stil some runs which I am not happy about, but better than 36 runs. He also ment it was ok to clean his paint gun on top of my new vanity even though paint dust was blowing all over! another thing to clean up after him. He also managed to get paint on my porch which he tried to clean right away with a green cloth and alcohol. That made my porch green and it was only saved becaused I was there with a new wet cloth to remove his mess.He tried to remove the paint he put on my new tiles with a metal knife ending up putting scratches on one tile before i stopped him!!!So yeah - if you don´t care about some paintruns in your bathtub and if you don´t care about your bathroom or surrounding - use him. Otherwise don´t. Its normal for him that there will be some paintruns after a reglaze and a mess of paint all over.The one star is for him coming back and try to redo his first job..."
1808,3,"I am conflicted about rating this company. My first experience with them years ago was good though expensive. This time, both my neighbor and I wasted 2 days each waiting for their roofer to show up. I missed appointments. I made numerous calls, received calls back assuring me that the roofer (Ronald) is about to leave to come to my property, just to learn from him at the end of the first day that ""office made some scheduling mistake."" Second day on the phone was a poor use of time as well, but if I did not do it, I doubt anything would happen. At the end, when a roofer did come, he did his job and charged the amount as per estimate. I asked him to clean eves troughs and the pipe for water exit  while on the roof but that did not happen. Customer service lady was good. But no one will give us back 2 days of our lives. No compensation was offered either."
1809,1,My mother and I decided to go with avenue road being they were more reputable and we  would pay for the job to be done correctly. I explained exactly what I wanted and was quoted for it. A few days later when we decided to go with them they upped the quote 3000$ more. We went with it thinking you get what you pay for. They come and do my walkway. It was supposed to be raised so the water would drain and I explained this when I was getting my original quote. After completion im left with a walkway that can't drain water and its full of water. The rotted wood that was supposed to be replaced is still there. I will now need to do more work as when I contacted them about this they replied this is just how it is and if u want we can install drains at additional cost plus a plumber. I assumed I would get what I paid for. Such a small job that cost us $8000.I do not recommend this company. They do horrible work and over price for a job that doesn't get completed the way you asked for it. Take a look at the picture added.
1810,2,"I gave one star only because a zero start rating was not an option. I called to book for a quote for services. The consultant came, looked at my roof, said I would have a quote within 24 hours. Its now been more than two and a half weeks, and I am yet to receive the quote. I have called TWICE to follow up, even speaking with the consultant himself on one occasion. Still no quote. I prefer not to throw my hard-earned money to people whom I have to run after for service. Thank-you-very-much."
1811,1,"I called this company and had them come out to get an estimate for a patio and a few other things. They came out and my rep said they would have a quote back to me by Tuesday of the next week, about 10 days time. That day came and went, Friday I called my rep and I asked when I would receive a quote, he went on to explain how busy he was and that he would send it when he had time. His tone was also that I was bothering him by calling. It has now been 4 weeks and I have not heard a word. As a result I believe people should stop calling this company for business as they are apparently to busy to follow through on what they say they will do. I am fearful for those of you who had something installed because if this is the kind service I received when I wanted to buy something, I wonder what it looks like when there is a problem or something needs to be fixed. I recommend you find someone else."
1812,1,"I cannot recommend this company.  Called them a few months back to get a quote on a patio and outdoor kitchen. Later that week Caleb called me and we made an appointment for him to come out.  My wife and I met him and he discussed ideas, took measurements, etc... He then said he would call us later that week and give us a quote as well as send us a 3d drawing of the layout.  He never called. After two weeks went by I called him and he was very apologetic and said that he would get us that info the following week.  It's literally been a couple months and we haven't heard back.  Extremely unprofessional. Don't know how they stay in business."
1813,3,"I had this company remove and replace a back patio for me. I had them install stamped concrete with a insulated cover. First off I had a two foot by two foot tile center piece I wanted to save the demo crew demoed it, it was set in concrete. They gave me a receptacle for their miss communication with their demo crew. Then the concrete the stamping at my patio door is very rough the expansion joint in that area looks very bad and then they set a stamp at a 45 degree angel over the first stamping they gave me a 1200.00 credit for that I wanted it replaced. They told me no way that will happen. Then the insulated covering the posts at first they looked good they were set about a foot in from the edge of the concrete.  Then they moved them out to the edge where one is flush two are set back a half inch and the fourth one is hanging over a half inch. I asked them to fix that they came out to the project with the last invoice we talked Rick the owner wrote on the invoice he would fix the posts if I gave him a payment towards the invoice of 3,000.00 he seemed like a straight up guy I gave him the money that was two weeks ago. I just got a new invoice for the remainder of the 12,000.00 plus contract stating I own them the last about 1,000.00 they have done nothing to the posts. This company is a mess there was no communication between them (Calba) the estimator and the guys doing the work. Then Rick the owner just wants the money it looks he does not care if his kids do good work or not and in this case they did a very poor job. Please look at the pictures. Then my driveway they drove over my planter and repaired it to their exceptions please look at the pictures."
1814,1,"These are the people that you want to hire ONLY if you want to live in STRESS for months at a time.  They tell you how everything is going to be beautiful and perfect and wonderful it's going to be done in 14 days.  The process started out they came and measured and then when they brought everything and started doing the granite was put in I had a problem with one of the granite slabs they took it back real ordered me another one OF COURSE they were only to happy to charge me extra because they put a slab with an 18""x 12. Black streak through it.  That is when I should have gotten someone else. Once the granite was in and the next step was to put glass tile on the walls. The glass tile was EVEN MORE HORRIFIC... They put in glass that were chipped and scratched,uneven, ungrounded, and  broken. I WENT THROUGH AND MARKED 58 mistakes that they had to repair.   When I came back all the places that were marked were not marked anymore yet they were not fixed. They tried to get away with as little as they could possible  When I complained about the glass not being flat against the wall but puckering out in places,  they told me that was normal. When I got upset the second time the installer said "" look we did not do it the way it should be done, we did not put new sheet rock and wire and therefore it's not going to adhere the way it needs to. We didn't do it the way it should so this is as good as it's going to get.  The right way was Too Expensive.  They had to come back and redo it four times. They left the house and the garage and the front driveway full of caulking and chalk the house looked like  they took bags of flour and just threw it on the floor. And that wasn't even the worst part after they fixed it for the third time they left grout everywhere and even and cleaned I had to actually scrub and I took me eight hours to clean it they dented the refrigerator on the side they dent in my dishwasher. I had no proof because I did not take pictures from before. So if you're going to use them you might want to take pictures of the whole kitchen. I had just had my cabinets  stained and they were beautiful until they were done then I had to clean them all over again as they left a horrific mess. They had to retro fix a cabinet and were going to leave it finished with a half ass job.  When I asked the cabinet guy if he would do that at his home, he told me know that he would do it the right way. So then I asked him so why wouldn't you do that for me. I made him do it the right way.  As far as paying them.  Watch out, the contract is written ONLY to protect them.   They came to my house did all the measuring asked for a third of the money upfront when they brought the granite they got 60%more of the $8000 payment leaving minimal to make sure that the whole job is completed.   When they came to finish the job, the job was not done correctly and I told them I could not pay them until the job is in correctly. He almost got into a fight with me over the phone yelling and screaming because I would not give him his $700. I refused to sign anything stating that he had done the job because he didn't. He was threatening me to sign the paperwork. I refused. They finally got it done and I was so happy to see them out of our home. It was supposed to be a 14 day job it became a 38 NIGHTMARE..   When I asked the owner about why it was taking so long and I told him maybe he has too many jobs,  his response to me was "" what, are you jealous?""  Who does that?  I am very good at referring people that do great work and have great customer service.  I would never ever refer them to anyone.  This stress was horrific and it was so very stressful to ask people to do with they were paid to do. They were horrible.  I hope that I save someone from going through what I went through by posting this."
1815,1,"I wish we would have looked at these Yelp reviews before getting granite from these people!The granite is was nice but over priced and the management has ZERO customer service skills. So the owner came to our house to do the measurements for the granite. Afterwards, he said it was all good to go and they would install the granite in about one week. Well, three weeks went by and still no granite! Finally they sent their crew over for the installation. Well go figure, the workers informed us that the measurement were wrong and the sink we picked out from their store wasn't  going to fit! Hmmm Mr owner....thats your fault!! After many phone calls and trying to get ahold of the owner without any luck. We eventually got in touch with them and told them we found another company to install the granite for WAY cheaper! We did leave a deposit with them which was more then the granite was worth. So when we picked up the granite they refused go give us our credit back. Then they wanted to charge us 6 months of storage fees for the granite! What a joke!!!If you have to deal with these people don't leave a big deposit with them because you won't get a penny back from them. So save yourself a headache and go to a different granite place!"
1816,1,Shame cheater companyCheated usWe order granite and they told us once u approve it we will start the cutting.We cancelled it next day without even looking at granite as it was too expensive and we found a really cheaper deal.And they refuse to refund the $3800Full deposit back and no contract was signed .And he forcefully took $800 for just talking to us about graniteBig cheat company be aware.I will pursue with BBB.How can they allow this type of business practice .Shame on Granite gallery Greedy owner.
1817,1,"A few weeks ago my AC was not blowing cold air, so I called Precision Aire. The owner/tech guy of the company came an hour early. A family member was home so I told her to go ahead and take the appointment early. I was still running errands and couldn't be there yet. Literally, one minute after the tech arrived, the member of my family called me, stating that the tech have told her that our compressor valve is no longer working. Moreover, we'll need to have the entire AC unit replaced for about $3K. I cut my errands short and came home right away. Luckily, the guy was still outside. I talked to him and he gave me the same run down. Diagnostic fee lost, AC still not blowing cold air. Upon a friend's advice, I called a different company for a second opinion. I made sure I was home so I could follow the tech around and ask questions. The other company's tech came in and told me that there was nothing wrong with the compressor. It was working fine and that according to his gauge readings I was simply out of refrigerant. So he pumped a little in and did a leak search. He found that their was a small leak in the evaporator coils. Replace bad coil and recharge, about $1K. Money saved. Honest job. Now, our AC is running like a champ. In conclusion, I wonder if Precision Aire was taking advantage of an old women who was home and not mechanically incline. You have been warned. Thanks for reading."
1818,3,I had this company come out to give me an estimate on replacing the duct work for my hvac.  The techician came out and looked at the ducts for under a minute and then stated he would need to go back to his office to run the numbers.  After a week I still had not heard from him so I called and I was told I would receive a call by the end of the day.  2 weeks later and I never heard back from them.  I left multiple messages.  Very unprofessional.
1819,1,"Our home warranty sent this company to fix our air and had advised that it was an attic repair, but precision said it was ok and came out. Daniel the owner came out to fix, not only did he leave a huge mess of insulation debris all over the garage, he left the old blower with its exposed wires next to the furnace (open flame) and did not bother putting the cover back on. Not only that, but the next day when the air kicked on at 4am we were scared to death by the metal to metal grinding that was coming from the attic.After calling the warranty, Daniel called back a few hours later stating that ""the bracket I installed may have come loose"". But because his ""body was so damaged"" from crawling thru the attic the day before he would not be able to come back till monday, followed by ""actually I won't be coming back unless you open the access thats closer to the blower"". Unfortunately, the previous owners had to add a support beam that closed off the old access and we are unable to open it. Its been three days now, and he will not return our calls or the home warranty reps calls. Since he was complaining about carrying his tools the 20ft to the blower my husband (who is 6'1"" and has NO problem walking up there) even offered to carry his stuff for him! But since he is throwing a tantrum and doesn't want to fix and finish the job (that he probably shouldn't have started to begin with), we are now having to pay for someone else to clean up his mess and fix what he supposedly fixed.By what I see- if you have an easy fix they may be a good company, but if they are actually going to have to work for their money- then steer clear of this company!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1820,2,"Decided to get a pool for the kids, and I did call them and left a VM and never got a call back, saw them at the home show in Fresno  1.5 weeks later spoke to Mike at the booth and mentioned that they never returned calls he looks in his phone and there was my request....regardless he came out 2 days later with a fairly high price with things I didn't really care about, he came over we tweaked the design and the price was much better he says he will email me the quote.GUESS WHAT, HE DOESN'T, he even txts me and says he will.  What ever happened Io honesty and integrity, apparently This company lacks both.....oh well I am happier and DEFINITELY more comfortable with who I choose.  Thanks HOLIDAY POOLS for wasting my time to accommodate your stupidity."
1821,2,"I called them about a week ago, because I want to get a quote on a new pool.  They took my information, said someone would get back to me the next day and then nothing.  Zip.  Nada.  That is not a good way to start off on a project.  I gave them a week to call me before giving up.  I will call another pool company who will (hopefully) be more interested in my business."
1822,1,"We are a customer of Holiday pools. The main point of this review is post how they treat customers after service.Our pool was installed in 2015. The heater is leaking. It also has a waterfall from a hot tub into the pool. The stones are coming off of the waterfall. We are thinking about changing to a heat pump.For over a month, I have been trying to get them to come out and look at the issues and paying to change out the heat pump. Many messages left with the secretary and the answering machine. No response. A phone message was received from the secretary last Thursday that they would be out by the end if the week. I was at home. They never showed.This is not the first time problems with their customer service have occurred. Getting a call back from the owner is almost impossible.Buyer beware."
1823,2,We are remodeling are bathroom and ordered tile for our shower.  A week later when they said it would be in we went to pick it up a young women said the person we ordered from was not in and that she didn't know if he even didn't ordered it. She acted like she could careless and told us she couldn't do anything for us. Terrible service we are now back to square one because I won't be giving them any of my money.
1824,3,"I went in today looking for backsplash tile.  I walked around the empty showroom for about 15 minutes waiting for someone to come in.  Tried getting the attention of someone out in the shop, but no one ever looks up.  So I just left."

Dal Tile was out of stock, so we told them how much we needed (20 pieces) and they were going to look into it and call us back with a price. We never received a call back... We called them a week later, and the guy advised they had already placed the order, and for the 20 trim pieces it would be $162!!! I was like, that's bizarre! Those pieces usually only cost $3 or so per piece. At that price it was around $8 a piece. The rep was like, ""yup, that's pretty typical pricing for those pieces..."" Well I don't think so. I cancelled the order, since they were never given the approval to order in the first place. The guy was like, ""Well I have to see if they've been shipped or not, first..."" At this point I was just like, WTH??? You don't even have my credit card information, you never called me to confirm, and there is no way i'm paying $8 for each trim piece... The guy was like, """"UUHHHH Oh yeah... Well let me just call you back."" Looks like I'll never hear from this place again... I would give 0 stars if I could. Save yourself the biggest headache and steer far, far away from this place."
1826,1,"Poor Work. Talked a big game but did not come through what was promised most of the paint job and cabinet work were off and unfinished I really had to complain so they come back and repaint them and seal the paint with a clear coat  like they're supposed to do. They also promised to give me a big vent that I needed for the stove but bought me a cheap $100 stove vent when I was quoted $400 on the contract his excuse was he added more cabinets for me so it kind of came out to the same price. Overall poor work and I still have missing cabinet shelves in my kitchen which was never finished and some poor electrical work that right now goes in and out. Also when they did the vebt work for my stove they left a big a hole in my ceiling which is still not patched up. When people ask me who did my kitchen, I tell them go somewhere else."
1827,1,"Where do i begin.  Addition Project (for the most part) eventually came out well (thanks to the workers).  However, bad experience with the proprietor of this business (and by proprietor I mean Luis Bravo). There were many broken promises.  Incomplete jobs.  Waiting extended periods to have things done.  Constant request for payments throughout the project (when contract stated 50% before - 50% when completed).  I made the mistake of referring (based on the quality of work of the workers) and again was let down.  Avoid like the plague.  Everyday I get into my vehicle i'm reminded of this company. . . with a big 10' hole in the middle of my driveway that has yet to be filled.  Thanks California Shine.Update:  Don't do it! You've been warned"
1828,2,"So sorry I didn't read reviews before signing a contract with them.  My neighbor and I are very disappointed with the workmanship  and quality of materials used in the fence they put up between our homes.  Fence boards that are seconds, at best, boards that are not secured, holes left around posts, no clean up!  Even dumped excess cement and dirt in flower bed...filled 1/2 of the garbage can.  Huge pieces of cement, screws, and nails left on ground along with lots of dirt and mud.  Lead supervisor on job was rude, stating that areas could not be fixed (turned around and walked away), would not put gate hardware on the side initially asked for because he had already put on the wrong side.  Left driveway dirty...very dirty.  Left in a hurry with our checks.  I called and asked for a supervisor to come look at the work and one came out and said it was unacceptable and they would be out to fix the following week.  That was three weeks ago.  They have not answered phone calls or emails.  Guess who won't be called again!"
1829,2,"A one is to good for this business. Horrible customer service! Would never use this company. Came out & gave estimate (1 hour late) scheduled day to do fix fence. We waited on Saturday for them to come & fix our fence, because they said they would be here but it would be late. No show & no phone call, very rude!  My husband gave another chance & again a no show & no phone call. Taking our business elsewhere"
1830,3,Called Soares to get an estimate to repair a gate.  Frank came out the next day and provided me with an estimate.  I asked if i could schedule an appointment to get the work done and was told someone would be out the following day.  A week went by and nothing so i called and was told someone would call me back.  Waited another week and called again and i received the same response.  I don't think they want my business.
1831,1,"THIS COMPANY DESERVES A ZERO for 1). Being very late during a heatwave while needing our AC fixed 2.) Lying about needing a part to fix our home Air-Conditioning unit and, thereby, 3). Running a scam. Here's what happened:We were at the beginning of a 9 day heatwave when our all home AC quit. Our Home Warranty Company put in a service order with Custom Controls Associates and gave us their phone number to follow up and to explain the situation and what we needed. They were going to be unable to get to us for a number of days despite our Home Warranty Co. explaining to them that we needed priority placement on their service list because the air quality coupled with the temperature was very likely going to result in the necessity for me to spend nights in the hospital. When we called we got a personal voice mail that simply said, ""Hi, this is Lilly. Please leave me a message"". I left a message for Lilly though I felt unsure I'd actually contacted any company at all because it was so unprofessional. When I called back, twice, later in the day, I got two more messages each different than the first and only one with the company name. This was unsettling. When I did get a call back, it was from Lilly. She couldn't schedule anything for three days so, yes...I did end up those three days in the hospital. Thanks for that Custom Control Associates: I'll forward the bill. When they finally booked a day, they also booked a window of time the service people would show up. The window was 1pm - 5pm. At 5:30 I called. Answering machine (not Voice mail). When I called at 6pm, answering machine (not voice mail). When I called at 6:30pm, answering machine (not a voice mail). I was being screened out as I was getting angrier and angrier and Lilly just, I suppose, didn't want to deal with me. Finally, around 6:45pm, when I was getting ready to leave for the hospital again, two technicians arrived. They climbed on the roof to check our AC unit. They were up there 5 minutes before coming back down and telling me they needed to order a part and wouldn't be back for 3, maybe 4 days. Unacceptable. However, it was too late to start this process over with another company, so mad, I let it go for a minute. Then, I did some research on YouTube. I watched a video, climbed up on my roof and fixed my own air-conditioning in 30 minutes by washing away the accumulated mud and changing out the oil. THEY KEPT ME IN THE HOSPITAL. THEY KEPT ME WAITING THE DAY OF SERVICE. THEY LIED ABOUT NEEDING A PART and HENCE...WERE RUNNING ONE BIG SCAM! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Custom Controls Associates: YOU'LL WAIT. THEY DON'T CARE. THEY WILL LIE. THE COMPANY IS RUNNING A SCAM! CALL SOMEONE ELSE. ANYONE Else or do like I did, and fix it yourself!"
1832,1,"There should be negative star ratings for this contractor. Extremely unprofessional.  Came to my house May 10 on a service call for AHS. They were prompt and stated I needed to get a new unit. I approved this and additional costs. I attempted to call the phone number on their business card 3 times and left messages with no return calls.  On May 27 I called AHS who reached them. They told AHS they had been trying to reach me yet I have the phone records to show no calls had been placed to my number. Through AHS we scheduled the install on Tuesday May 31 at 4pm.  I called that day to confirm and was informed they couldn't do it that day and promised Wed June 1 at 4:00pm. I rescheduled patients and took the afternoon off to be here and when they hadn't showed up at 430pm I called them.  No answer. I left a voicemail to call me.  At 5:30pm I called again as they had not shown.  Louise answered and said ""oh we didn't get to secure the crane so we can't do it"". No call. No reschedule. I have a disabled family member in a house with no a/c and it was 106 degrees  outside and 89 inside. She didn't seem to care. ""Well I'm sorry for the inconvenience"" is all she said.  I asked why no call or reschedule all I got was ""sorry"". She could not confirm a time for the next day either.  Horrible service.  Horrible experience.  I would certainly not ever use them or recommend them to anyone."
1833,3,"Like Dan B., I had a similar experience with Custom Controls Associates (CCA). Called American Home Shield (AHS) on  7/28, received the confirmation that Custom Controls Associates was assigned the same day. Waited 48hrs with no response from the contractor. Called CCA the same day with no response. Called AHS and they got CCA on the phone. There was still no commitment and the said they would call me later, I even gave them time frames that I could be available. 24hrs later no call or response from CCA. I have wasted 5 days just waiting for them to just call and schedule a visit. I had to have AHS reassign the ticket. I understand that they could be busy. I would have been okay if they said we won't be able to get to you for a few days. They chose the wrong approach in my opinion."
1834,1,"If I had the opportunity to rethink my decision to have Western Homes build my house, I would go with a different builder. The company has not met any of their 'stated' timelines, they have not produced a quality product and refuse to provide a completion date. I have had to extend the construction loan twice, and pay penalties on the loan, due to the lack of completion. They broke ground in September 2017 and as of now, cannot provide a completion date even though they provided a statement that the 'process' would be completed approximately 8 weeks after the cabinets were installed. That was done at the end of May 2018, and it has now been 14 weeks. Getting anything done is like pulling teeth. Communication with the owner and his contractor, Jay Bains, does not happen unless you instigate, via email, and insist on a reply back. They will not install or make arrangements for utilities, you should not expect that they will do that for you. Do not believe that they will complete any build within their advertised time line of 30 weeks. Expect to have to review all of their work, before completion, and provide them with numerous lists of items to be addressed. My current list has been with them since June 2018, and I keep adding to it. Expect to hear, from Mr Bains, the 'you should just live with...' any defect you find and that the repair or fix would be worse than what you have. I will be issuing a complaint with the contractors board, against the company and Mr Bains, for false advertising, poor construction quality and failure to meet expected timelines. Not to mention their sub contractors stealing items from the job site and drinking while on the job site. So, unless you want to review their work daily, and be on-site every day of the build, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!"
1835,2,"As an update after posting on Yelp. I received a call from the owner Tim. Very apologetic and said they would take care of the problem. It took a few weeks but they did fix to our satisfaction. Tim also stressed that if there is any other problems even if it is after the first year, they would look into fixing it.I did appreciate the customer service Tim showed, I just wish we would have seen this kind of concern earlier. That is the reason for the 3 stars.New update: Contacted Western Homes 6/17/18 because the fix on our carpet came undone. Western Homes would not get back to us ever. Finally I called the sub contractor out and he was nice enough to come fix his error but he said he should get the work order from Western, I explained they would not answer me, and he shook his head and said that is what he hears all the time.So obviously they only fixed the problem the first time because of yelp review after not getting the stars they wanted, they were DONE with me.Talk no action."
1836,3,"In my opinion you would be wise to drive on by and talk to other builders  If you run out of gas in front of Western Homes catch a bus, call Uber, Lyft, a taxi, walk, or if none of those are options crawl to another home builder. This is our second Western and I cannot imagine having another one built after this one. I felt our first Western was much better quality from the beginning. This one came with problems from top to bottom. I believe by the time the problems are worked out it is better initially to pay a little more and start with a better home.  Hopefully then you won't be pouring money into it to get it where it should have started."
1837,1,"I would absolutely never recommend this company. I believe they are disorganized and fraudulent in the way they deal with their clients. Here is why.1. I purchased my building, through a broker, quickly after he let me know that the prices of steel would be going up, and if I locked it in they would honor the prices. So, I signed the contract and sent in the deposit.2. When it came time for the building to be put in, California All Steel told me that the contract I have for the building and the plans from the engineer do not match and I owe them more money than my contract said.3. I spoke with both, the manager and the broker who wrote up the contract. The broker was trying to work with both of us and make sure the contract was honored, and the manager at California All Steel told both of us they would agree to reducing the amount they told me that I owed them for the extra beams, etc. from $4,500 to $3,600.4. I asked them to finance that remainder, so that I could just pay what was on the contract and pay the rest over time.5. They said no, but I could use the finance company they are affiliated with.6. I applied, was accepted and told them to send the new contract.7. Instead of $3,600 more, the contract said I was to pay $7,200 more (even more than they originally quoted above) because the cost of everything was higher than in my original contract. 8. I sent that to my broker.9. I talked to the manager who said she would just charge the $3.600 more and she said she had to get approval from above her.10. The manager of California All Steel told my broker that I had three days to accept the $3,600 more deal they offered (which they never told me). Regardless, I did accept within three business days.11. Several days later, after my broker called them multiple times, they sent me a revised contract that gave me a discount, but it was a discount on the new price they worked up, with all new prices. This was approximately $5,700 more than what my contract says.In addition to this, California All Steel tried to get the numbers from the finance company for payment PRIOR to sending me the contract. The finance company told me specifically not to give that out to anyone until I was ready to pay.What it seems like to me is that after I had financing for more than the cost of the new prices, California All Steel believed they had me over a barrel (because my permits are for exactly what I was ordering from them - via the engineer's plans). It also seems they wanted to cheat me and get paid before they put in the building.Why did they want to get the payment information prior to me signing the contracts?Why was there no communication between the engineer and the manufacturer, indicating the plans needed more support? During the process of getting a permit, they had months to discover the plans and the pricing were off, and let me know that.I don't think this is a company anyone should have to deal with. I highly recommend you go with another company! I'm logging a complaint.Original contract - 12,891.50New contract they are trying to get me to sign (WITH the new discount!) - 19,406.33For a $6,514.83 difference."
1838,3,"After waiting for 4 months for the carport to be delivered and installed, we cancelled the order.  We purchased the carport through US Metal Garages (Mayberry Metals) and the salesman told us ""3 to 5 weeks"" for deliver and installation.  When I called him after 4 months to complain, he said that it's not unusual to wait 6 to 8 months for installation!  If I had been told that initially, I could have looked for a different contractor.  Now I'm hoping to get my deposit refunded."
1839,1,"BUYER BEWARE...Before you purchase a steel building from any company check what company manufacturers there materials. STAY CLEAR of California All Steel Carports and their affiliates. We purchased a carport and was told by their affiliate that delivery will be 3 to 5 weeks. Two weeks after we put our deposit on our carport we received a call from CA All Steel Carports, Elizabeth asking if we were ready for delivery. We told her yes and she said she will get it scheduled and call me tomorrow. We expected a call back, well I guess their phone can't make Outbound calls because we called for the next day and was told ""I am looking at trying to get a crew together and we can get it scheduled"", I heard this the next three weeks every time I called. I was finally tired of the lack of customer service and receiving no return calls that I was told I would receive, the manager still could not even call me so I asked to cancel the order. WOW this got their attention and they called me to have it delivered that Friday. I left work early and it was delivered,they were not installing it so I got a hand written list of what was delivered and no ""must do this"" instructions. After we installed the frame and got the roof installed next was the side. Well the last panels are a foot short. Here goes the fun of the calling and getting no where. Manager Flor finally spoke to me two days later and is now stating that a 25 foot carport frame should out been 24 feet and we should of known that. We should of known that you have to cut a foot off the fame so the panels fit on the side. I told her that did not make sense and her team did not state this. Her response is ""any contractor know that when you order a carport the frame is a foot shorter."" So I asked how many have she built and she said ""none"". I am an experienced engineer and have built additions and cabins but I am the dumb one I guess. BUYER BEWARE. This company is a joke."
1840,3,"Have had many great nights at KuniSama but tonight was bad enough that we won't be back. We were sat at a table that needed to be wiped down and were told it would be. It wasn't. Ever. I had to ask for napkins to push the bits of rice on the table onto the floor. We ordered water, a coke and a beer. The water came fast. The coke 10 minutes later. The beer must have sat at the bar after being poured for 15 minutes or more because it came lukewarm. We ordered an appetizer and two rolls. One roll came. We asked for napkins and utensils. Then waited 10 minutes until the second roll came to get chopsticks. We waited 20 minutes after we were done eating to order mochi, which came so long later that it was melting. The atmosphere was bad but it was because of a loud group of drunks at the bar, which I don't blame the waitstaff for. But it wasn't busy enough to merit such terrible service. One star because none isn't an option."
1841,3,"I went on a Saturday night & ordered Togo while having a drink the bar while I waited, nice restaurant with a chill atmosphere. I ordered 2 ramen soups. When i got home The broth cup plastic lid melted into the other and spilled all into the bag so I didn't have enough miso I called the next day to let them know what had happened when i got home just so they can be mindful in the future but a rude lady answered hung up on my face after telling me the manager isn't in til later instead of taking initiative like taking down my info to leave a note for the manager to call back at a convenient time For them."
1842,1,"Had a bad experience with tepan this weekend so decided to come in again today and try the sushi. I didnt want to pass judgment until i had something solid to base things off of. Well let me tell you that regardless of what others may say i would not recommend this place to any one.. Not only is the Tepan way over priced, but its just not worth the trouble. I asked for management this weekend and apparently they were too busy drinking it up with the other workers. So i figured id save it for today. Well instead of going thru all that i'll just make sure to post the pics in my article next month. Those are the perks of being a mystery customer. Poor Management , slow service and nothing on the menu is consistent except the outrageous pricing.."
1843,3,They have very loud music. It's looks like it could be a night club. They have mediocre drinks. Don't like their service here. They never greet me and never ask to take my order even if I'm standing right at the counter. Every time i come here I always have to approach them to take my order. Food takes a long time but they do tell you that it takes a while. They have cute decor and lots of games. I'd probably never go back to this place. Not my cup of tea.
1844,3,"I'm not from the area came to visit some family and they told me this place was really good so I had to come try it. First impression walking in was that it was nice really cute it wasn't busy so got a table right away I went with four of my cousins they took a little long to get our order but that wasn't a big deal once we ordered it didn't take long to get 4/5 drinks and I was still waiting on mine I ordered an avocado milkshake and I waited and waited and other guests that came after us were getting served even people who showed up 40 minutes after got there drinks before I did, only reason I even waited was because my cousins got their drinks and I waited for them to finish. We went up to the counter to pay and I asked about the drink and the cashier said it wasn't on the order so after 50 minutes waiting for this drink I guess I was never going to get it. Very upset very unprofessional they didn't try fix the problem cashier didn't care either very rude."
1845,3,"Usually come every so often to get something to drink as a take out, but this night wasn't crazy busy or looked too busy to begin with. Gave us a seat in the corner without taking me and my buddy there. Also didn't hand us a menu. That was a negative already.  Just sat there talking with my friend, looking at the menu of what to order. Time flew by, no sever came to even greet us, that was about 20 minutes or so. Have benefit of the doubt because it it was just a little busy I suppose. People next to us left, the dude that told us to sit in the spot we are now came and buss whatever the table was there, didn't even asked if we have been helped yet. About 40 minutes or so came, still nothing so we left. To my expectation, all the Togo people got the drinks and left and others that came in within 5 minutes got their drinks already and left. That's what I call some shitty service, also the host dude that supposedly sat us, I'd be surprised you even make tips from your low working status. Guaranteed he judged my fiend's and my hair style. Thank you for the read.  Still little ticked if you haven't already notice."
1846,2,"We get to bjs and get a 2 hour wait. We were understanding because we didn't have a reservation however once we were seated we received extremely slow service. Although I ordered my steak medium and it came out so rare.. I know this because I cut into the center. I asked if they could refire it and they said it's policy that once a guest cuts in, they can't throw it back on- they have to remake it. 45 minutes go by and still no steak. It finally came out and I cut in and sure thing it's rare. blood was seeping out all over the plate and onto my mash potatoes so I sent it back. Then the manager comes out and says it ""must be the lighting in here"" because in the kitchen it looks medium. So I explained to him all the reasons why his excuse made no sense. My husband enjoyed his dinner but by the time my food came out he had finished. I decided I didn't want the steak after their third attempt of the manager bringing it out charred well done. I work at a steakhouse myself and we always do our best to ensure that the guest enjoys their meal and they get what they pay for. Bjs is not a cheap place so you'd thing that their priority is to get their food to a standard that the guest enjoys. Aside from that you should never argue with your guest especially when they are being friendly about a mistake made on the kitchens end. So disappointed. I will never go back."
1847,3,Wow Bj food is amazing but the service at the bar is  terrible  I guess when your by. Yourself eating at the bar it is common that the bartender don't know his name is so rude to me. He forgot my points from the last time I was here he did not even ask me if I was a reward member which I am.  It is very disappointing that I have to wait to travel out of town to enjoy bj's Brewhouse.
1848,3,Another example of terrible management. Order placed at 4:13pm I called to confirm the order because I know sometimes this restaurant gets behind. Waited on hold till I was hung up on. I then called back and was on hold another 15 mins I actually walked in the door when someone answered the phone. I asked them if it was common practice to leave someone on hold for 15 mins without checking she replied no. I let her know I was from grubhub and was trying to confirm an order. She asked the name and I gave it to her she informed me they just confirmed the order. More than 23 mins later they are just now putting he order in. I asked if there was an issue because the restaurant seemed rather slow again it's 448 now and she said it would be about 15 mins. The manager Cisly to me was very unpleasant imo but she did try to make it right by saying she was expediting the food. Unfortunately the pick up time was at 448 and it will be delivered late. Again I could understand more if the place was busy but it was before dinner rush on a Monday. Had I been trying to place an order the restaurant would have no doubt just lost the customers business. Over 40 mins for 2 rare steaks a salad and a pizza seems like a crazy amount of time to me.
1849,3,"The beer was room temperature. The food was so bad, I couldn't even finish it. It had a almost no flavor and the flavor it did had was ""expired"" and ""greasy"". I want to say I just happened to go on an off day, but there is literally no excuse to have food or beer come out that bad. I'll stick with dog house. I was extremely disappointed."
1850,2,Food was so salty I could not eat it!!!! And my burger was over cooked felt like I was chewing that salty bite for 30min!!! Waste of money ......Very disappointed after paying $44 for burgers and fries off Uber eats will not order again that's for sure !!!
1851,3,"I really wanted to like this place it was my first time here it was either my go to Doghouse Grill or Bulldog Bistro wanting to try somthing new I took the chance and stopped. The customer service was average took our order down pretty a straight forward task. Came out to around $50 for 3 adults and a child. Woah The food took about 15 minutes to come out I had the ""famous"" $13 Big Bulldog Burger wich is double patties, pastrami, bacon lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. The patties were juicy and that's pretty much the only decent thing about the burger everything was over powered by an insane amount of mustard on the burger. My wife had the Ortega tri tip burger wich was also over powered by mustard very disappointed. We also tried there popular doggy style fries wich are fries covered in jalapeño popper sauce. Very bland and over priced for the small amount given $4.50 before tax. All in all the experience could've been better if it's wasn't for overpriced, undersized poorly executed food."
1852,2,"I like the flavors Buffalo Wild Wings offer but this location is trash. Placed a take out order and I had 7 wings from my order missing when I got home. If I can't trust this place to get the order right then hard pass on this garbage establishment. Ranch sauces are half filled as well. Their either cheap and trying to make a profit stingy, this place is too damn expensive for them to be pulling shit like this. Rather stick with wing stop."
1853,1,"Buffalo Wild Wings has more filth, piss-poor customer service, and more parking spots than good food. This leaves BWW leadership to watch customers park in BWW vacant parking spots and walk across the street to where the good food and clean accommodations are located, Doghouse Grill. Evidently, BWW LEADERSHIP IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED at this dynamic, because they've given their unkempt security guard authority to have vehicles towed. Yup, $110 for the tow truck company to drop the vehicle in place if you're lucky enough to catch them in time, or $330 to pick-up from the yard. Given BWW's piss-poor public relations, filth, vindictiveness, and cruelty, I'm looking forward to their inevitable, economic demise."
1854,1,Unhappy customer.. I will never ever attend none of the Buffalo Wild wings in fres no.. Particularly the E shaw across fres no state service was horrible staff where unprofessional and on top of that There security who supposedly is suppose to be guarding the parking lot and who I was told that he and his company have been educated to give customers awareness of not parking in the area If u don”t eat at Buffalo wild wings but the guard has no integrity and lies and has customers vehicles towed away working with the tow company and pricing high tow fees to steal from people and it's totally wrong and unethical and Buffalo  wild wings is aware I spoke with a manger who knows of this and was no help.. It is very sad that a place of business practices greedy unethical business even to customers who eat at the place it's the security guard that they hire who for things out of lack of integrity.. I am not a happy customer and don’t recommend this place of good service to eat or park...
1855,3,"So this is one of my least favorite places in the downtown area for many reasons. First I'd like to say it takes way too long to be seated they are very unorganized when it comes to seating and getting drinks bringing food etc. My most recent visit I decided to have one of their veggie burgers, by far one of the worst veggie burgers I've ever had.  I might give them another shot but as of now 1 star if there was less than 1 star I'd rate them half a star."
1856,3,"Pretty crappy experience there today. Horrible service.  The place was empty - only 3 customer tables occupied. They had 2 waitresses, but apparently serving those 3 tables was too much for them.  Our waitress would disappear, and we could not get any need attended to. Twice we had to go to the bartender to ask for help. Probably the most inattentive service ever -- especially shocking given the waitress to customer ratio."
1857,2,"Aweful. The hostess told us it would ve a twenty minute wait to be seated, yet there were a ton of open tables. We asked about the open tables and she said ""oh yeah sure That makes sense"" so she seats us. Next we sit for a LONG time without wait staff even coming to take a drink order while the table next to us got visited three times. Finally I went up to the bar and asked what it takes to place an order. They agreed to send a waiter over. A scruffy guy that looked drugged out showed up a while later, se we order beers, waters, appetizers, and main course food all at once- knowing it may be tough to get a second shot at ordering anything around here! He asks zero clarifying questions during ordering so we are very concerned. A while later beers show up- still no waters. Then the appetizer comes- no silverware or plates. We flag someone down twice to ask for silverware and plates. A while later food comes. It was ok not great. We flag waiter down to ask when we will get waters. ""Oh yeah"" is the response. In general the whole experience SUCKED. Will never return."
1858,2,"This place used to carry great food and even better hospitality (Sam!) an year or so ago. However, my recent visit to this place has left me completely disillusioned. Their Lula kabob, which I have eaten before and then relived the taste in my mind several times thereafter, was  very poorly made this time. It was dry, did not have a single herb and tasted 'off'. My son, who is a big fan of Mediterranean kabobs, didn't take a second bite of the kabob this time. The chicken chunks in chicken kabob were dry and overdone. Most importantly, our leftover pilaf - which was stored in our refrigerator overnight - had white saturated fat in it the next morning. And I thought this food was healthy! Don't these Mediterranean places charge so much because they use olive oil as the cooking media, or is that just a myth in my head? Either way, this business will not see a cent more of my money, that's said and done."
1859,1,"Ordered the chicken kabob but got something else lol chicken kabob menu showed a pic of kabobs on a stick. So that's what I ordered but didn't get no chicken on a stick instead got chicken pieces on a plate with all the other sides. I give this a 1 star for false advertisement! I feel you should get what you ordered and the menu has something Different then what you get! But food was good, Spices and mixes and seasoning where different from traditional American food that's around here. Maybe I'll go next  time  if the manager sees this and comps me for the false advertisement on what I ordered. if not I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, because you don't get what is advertised in menu. You get a surprise dish that you didn't order lol."
1860,3,"Good food but 1 star for:Come on Dean:Not using ice scoop to load ice into the glasses.  Instead they scoop up the ice in the ice container with the plastic glasses.The door leading in and out of the patio is kept open when it's busy which is a heath code violation unless the door is equipped with a ""fly fan"" and it is operation while the door is open."
1861,1,"Bartender Ashley is an extremely rude lady who shouldn't be in customer service, she delivers constant eyerolls and speaks to you in a rude tone of voice. Waiter was inattentive, forgot 2 of our parties plates while he stood around talking to Ashley both serving some major PDA in the bar area, completely inappropriate for workers but according to these other reviews management won't care. Save your money and go elsewhere!!"
1862,1,"The service is deplorable and the management is worse. I walked out without ordering after waiting an eternity to be addressed by waitstaff. The manager couldn't care less. It's apparent from the lack of response to the many negative reviews that the management team at this location has failed in applying even the very basics of customer service. It should be noted; this particular establishment is located in the heart of ""restaurant row"" on Blackstone with countless other dining choices within easy walking distance. Please exercise that choice. Go elsewhere.*Update: In a fraudulent and ham-handed effort at ""problem resolution;"" management asked me to contact them without providing their contact information. A complete joke."
1863,3,"Not a great experience at all. First, server didn't bring me the right drink even after I had repeated myself three times.Second, people who arrived 20 some odd minutes after us received their food first despite us only ordering two items. Not only that, but when it /did/ arrive (after inquiring about it) it was warm at best and given without extra plates. The rest of the night was spent not receiving refills nor being acknowledged by our waitress until we actually hailed her down. To add, it wasn't even busy! The only saving grace was the dessert at the end. Brownie with vanilla ice cream? Yes please. Other than that, subpar."
1864,2,"This use to be the place my wife and I took our family. Great food and service was amazing........so we thought. We are here now and 1. Sat us next to the dish washer area and it had a funky smell. So we asked to move. Next, we ordered and still. 30 mins it took. We ordered a stuff mushroom appetizer and received our entrees and still no mushrooms. Now my entree. It said unlimited soup and salad. I didn't see anything else involved with that so I got that. Not the case...... you have to buy and entree to get the unlimited and to top it off. Unlimited EITHER soup OR salad. It's not both. I mean come on. False advertising at its best. Ordered ice tea. No refill and it's been empty for a while now.Now we asked for our mushrooms and the waitress said she will ask the kitchen where it is. I mean please! You should've known about the appetizer you put in the order. Service today is horrible!!!! To top the service. Gave my card to pay for our food and it took 15 minutes to get my card and bill back. What is going on here!This use to be a go to place for my family. Looks like I'll have to take my family elsewhere from now on. What a shame to how this establishment went downhill."
1865,3,"Visited Romano's Macaroni Grill for a date with my wife. The place was nearly empty but we had to wait 5 minutes for a table for two. Staff people were polite but after we ordered we had to wait 50 minutes for our entrees. The excuse was that they were training new cooks. I had ordered Chicken Marsala which turned out to be bland, undercooked, and had ZERO Marsala. The meal was disgusting. My wife's eggplant parmigiana was burned on the bottom. The server did comp my meal and she seemed exceedingly embarrassed. I had higher expectations for what used to be a nice restaurant."
1866,2,"This was my second time dining at MG. The first time we had a party of 12 and they had a new waitress serving us. Almost everything we ordered from wine, appetizers to entrees were unavailable. They forgot a whole appetizer. Orders were wrong etc. Luckily we were all in a good mood and just said ""ehh whatever"".  Sooooo I decided to try it again with family from out of town.. a party of 7 this time. Made reservations for 6:45. Seated fairly quickly, drinks came in timely manner. Good start! Then we placed our orders, waitress asked if I wanted to add chicken or shrimp to my order and I said yes chicken please, and a side of broccoli. (I ordered fettuccini Alfredo.  Almost an hour later they brought out the food. Mine had no chicken nor broccoli, and they completely forgot my daughters meal all together. I let them know, and our waitress HOLLY who took the order literally said ""okay so what are we missing?"" In the rudest tone. Uhm a WHOLE dinner! Now I'm offended and said a whole order of kids spaghetti and meatballs. Okay so they brought hers out after. Then mine with chicken and broccoli. I poked the broccoli and it was raw... rock hard, not cooked at all. Okay now I'm frustrated and asked to speak to a manager. I forgot his name but he was very nice. They re-did my meal for the 3rd time. Okay thanks, it was tasty. But by that time my entire table had finished eating. So I got a to go box. The manager also brought out a dessert on the house. And ""discounted"" the check. What they did was they didn't charge us for the $6.50 kids meal that they ""forgot"".  Okay what ever, anyways I left a nice on their paper table cloth for Holly. Suggesting she should be more polite when SHE makes a mistake. I noted that everyone has off days but still, professionalism goes a long way, even if you are just a server.  Now I know why they were like the only restaurant in town that had available tables to reserve.  And to top it off there was mayyybe 6 other tables with customers in the whole place. So it's not like they were busy.    Needless to say, I will not be returning. *"
1867,2,"We have a Mother's Day reservation, took use 30 mins to be seated understandable it's busy, they got our order, an hour after we got our food, understandable they are busy, we got our crap ehh food. I order steak and egg. Steak on their menu should be aged for something days, steak came burnt to death and unseasoned. Food just horrible not only steak. My wife like this place but she told me we will never come back to this place."
1868,2,Made reservations and came 20 min early. Over hour latter still not seated. They are way above capacity. People are leaving that had reservations because they are taking in walk-ins with no concern for those that made plans weeks in advanced. Won't come back. Poor planing for Mother's Day.
1869,2,"This used to be a favorite, no more. Visited Mimis today and GREATLY DISAPPOINTED. They no longer have popular bran muffins and rain/carrot bread which used to be put on the table with entrees. Not even available from bakery. Two of three entrees DISAPPOINTED.  Salmon served cooked properly but EXTREMELY SALTY throughout the flesh... unpleasant. Roast Beef dinner changed from previous visits... served over cooked. Tender but very DRY.  Visit left NO reason to return."
1870,3,"My  family and I have been to the other locations and this one used to be my go to due to it being so close to my house. However, lately I've noticed a decrease in the quality of food AND customer service. Every time I visit, I notice there is someone new who hasn't been properly trained due to there lack of knowledge about the menu and customer service skills. I'm assuming this has to do with new management because:1.  I've been visiting this location ever since they've opened and I've never had this issue  2.  because I have witness the manger yelling at one of the employees after she accidentally spilled some food on a customer (who was totally understanding about the situation) the girl was obviously sorry and had tears in her eyes. However, the manager was completely unemphatic towards the girl and was more concerned about the ""waste of product"". I understood her concern for the waste of product but as a manger you have to be able to know the proper time to discuss those issues in private. Because! it's a total mood killer when you're enjoying your food with your family."
1871,1,"If I had the option to give no stars I would. I had gone in for lunch on May 3 and ordered a chicken shawarma. The food was great, no complaints. BUT what drove me to write this complaint is that Lisa who took my order was so rude. I couldn't pronounce ""shawarma"" and she ""corrected"" me on how to pronounce it. I'm not sure if she was in a rush or something but she was so short with me and seemed as if it was towards the end of her shift and was ready to leave. I had then asked to speak to a manager to let them know of her customer service so they can work on it but that is when she informed me she was the manager. I do not know how this girl is manager, she is rude and inconsiderate. I will not be coming back to eat at this location nor will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone."
1872,2,I've been coming here for years and I went in yesterday to Order a few wraps. They changed menu and the prices. My falafel wrap used to be $6.95 and now it's $9! Everything went up and I'm shocked because I can go to many Mediterranean places and get bigger portions for way cheaper. The wraps are so tiny with barely anything inside!! I'm extremely disappointed. I'm never going back. Sorry Tofas but you failed.
1873,2,"This use to be our favorite P.F. Chang's every weekend after work. Now the entree's are in oz and we the people are not paying in OZ. What a way to use the system to your advantage. You lost a valuable customer and so unfair to people that really work hard and look forward to eating without cooking. Now we have to buy 3 entree's of orange chicken just to cover 4. Wow amazing how the customer keeps all stores open, but we don't get taken care of. Wake up people and make sure we get what we work hard for. Wow very butt hurt."
1874,1,"This is the worst experience I've had at a PF Chang's. I had high expectations but it definitely felt short. DO NOT order the fried green beans In The appetizer menu. The Ahí Poke bowl had a very small amount of tuna and avocado, definitely not meant to be an entree. The chicken in the wonton soup was terrible. The waitress was really nice but the management and the kitchen staff was very dismissive when it was brought to their attention. Not worth the time or the money. Definitely stick with their classics and food that is harder to mess up."
1875,2,"First time here and will be my last.  Our party met at 6 for a birthday celebration.  Every step of the process was slooow and our meals finally started arriving at 6:54.  Servers put the dishes on the table randomly so WE had to figure out what went where.  Two entrees were cold and three side dishes never showed up (we managed to round up 2).  Nothing special was done for the birthday child, but that's okay...apparently not their thing. A disappointment, to say the least."
1876,2,Too dark to see the menus inside this place and way too over priced for the food that you get. I also found a small dead bug in my water and a live small bug flying around my food in this restaurant. I won't be going back to this place ever again.
1877,1,"Absolute WORST service and more disgusted with the managers response and behavior.  For this price point is an establishment I expect much better customer service and response to issues.Server was totally flat and seemed annoyed to be working.  This was at time of drink order. Even my 12 year old daughter commented that she was rude and didn't want to ask her for more to drink.   She never came to refill drinks and when asked to refill one she never offered to refill the other people in party.  We were a party of 12 and asked at the start to split the check 50/50.  The checks came split she put wrong items on the checks specified.  We decided to not deal with asking her to change.  I provided her my card for the amount on the check/ bill she gave.  When it was returned for me to sign she ran the amount for an increased amount than the original bill stated.  I asked her to which she said ""Oh yeah, I'm off today and noticed I didn't put something on your check.  So I added it and told my manager.""  I indicated to her that she should not have run my card without informing me first and secondly I shouldn't be the one to ask.  Her response was ""I'm off today.  I'll get my manager.""  The manager comes over and says ""You wanted to see me?""  I communicated to her my concern about the bill and how it was run.  Also communicating as the manager she should have guided the server differently on how to handle it.  Managers response "" yeah that shouldn't have happen.  We are sorry. "". I further stated that she needs to know that the server was not pleasant and actually was almost a ""bitch.""  The managers response ""I'll have a talk with her"". We were already up to leave at this point and it took our party less than 5 min to get to door to leave.  As we passed the hostess area the server came by and said in passing "" in sorry.  And I'm sorry I'm such a bitch""- with attitude.  Clearly the ""counseling"" the manager did in the brief time it took us to stand up and leave was to tell the server we called her a bitch.  I immediately went to back if restaurant to find manager to once again express my dismay with the server and her poor managerial tactics.  The manager reaction almost was comical to me at this point bc she seemed to only know how to say ""oh, that's not good I will talk to her. "". I had to ask for this managers superior and contact information.  I by no means want or expected any compensation (bc I don't want to go back to get it) but fact not even offered show how trashy this place is to keep customers.  Decided not to bother to voice to corporate but better to Yelp so you all can know!"
1878,2,Went in really used to like this place. Not sure what kind of meat was served to both myself and wife. The textures didn't even look the same. One was like a hot dog shaped piece of meat the other was just like a pork chop. Asked for medium steak came well done not good either. I don't complain to waiters don't want my food returned with whatever there going to get mad about. Wasn't busy at all. I won't be returning! Thanks but no thanks.
1879,2,"Terrible experience tonight. Appetizer came out cold. When our burgers came out mine was missing avacado and cheese... They offered to bring out avacado and cheese so I said OK. Told my wife not to wait for me thinking it couldn't be too long to get my order fixed.... I was wrong. By the time they came with the cheese my burger was cold and my wife was basically done eating.  Told me I wouldn't be charged for the messed up burger. How generous of them. Brought the check, still paid $35 for a soda, lemonade, fries and my wife's burger. Will never be back."
1880,3,"Red Robin is normally my go to place but after tonight I'll look at other options before choosing them. I waited at my tables for 40 minutes, after being sat down. One waitress who sat us said our waitress would be with us shortly. After waiting... and waiting we noticed other tables were being filled and drinks were brought to them yet no one has taken our drink order or food order. Keep in mind we waiting 30 minutes to be sat and now have waited 40 minutes at the table. As there were plenty of free waters and waitresses that weren't doing anything as they socialize and talked with one another hiding from their JOB. If this happens again I'm rethinking your service."
1881,2,"I tell you I don't know why I return here. Time after time they just totally disappoint. I came with my granddaughter (17 years of age) around4:00/4:30 pm. Not crowded at all. We walk in ""How many sir"" I say 2, he says okay it'll be a few minutes. Before us he calls out another party of two. Two minutes later they say your table is ready. So we walk in and they take us allllll the way thru the restaurant where along the wall there are 3 maybe 4 booths for probably four people or less. Then a smaller booth for two and another booth for 4 or less. Now mind you we walked all through the restaurant where we passed table after empty table to get to this area of the restaurant. People who have eaten here before know this area as this is where they put families with children - not that there were any but that's the location they tried to seat us in or around. So the young lady says here you go and points to the booth for two and I ask her can we get this booth instead which was the larger one. She turns to me and says ""well"" and I say ""well what ? So I say just forget about this and start to leave and I'm saying and pointing ""That couple is in a big booth, point to another saying ""that couple is in a booth also"" and walk out with my grandaughter. Just BS this place is - never, never ever will I go to this location again. I've learned my lesson, thank you."
1882,2,"We were treated to the rudest host I have ever experienced. His remarks were curt and disrespectful. Totally disinterested in his job, this was the first impression, then you take a breath of air and the place smells like the urinal drains into the dining room. We left and went to the Marie Callender's. It may be a little bland however the atmosphere is pleasant along with the staff. I hope the management reads this, the host should be removed. I will never go to your restaurant again the rest of my life. A one star rating is too generous, I was looking for the zero rating."
1883,3,"Worst service experience! I didn't expect this since we had been here a few time before. To start, we came in and they told us there was a large group so the wait would be 1-2 hours. So we went to the bar area. So we sat and waited 20 mins for someone to serve us. Understanding  of the large group I didn't take it bad so we continued on with our meal. Next took our server another 20 mins for our cocktail which I that I could not understand since the bar was right next to us. Another 20 for waters as well. So we had a round of cocktail and asked for another. My wife's cosmo did not have vodka in it but tequila. Instead of an apology, waitress and staff were just saying it was because of this and that instead of remaking the drink and apologizing for it. At the emd of our meal they charge my dirty martini with 2 different prices. All in all. Horrible dinner. So many negatives. A very unsatisfied customer here."
1884,2,"I wanted cow and Brussels sprouts.  Black Angus has both.  Big mistake this time. (Small mistake last time.  So stayed away a few months hoping things would improve. They have not.)Wow. How the mighty have fallen. This used to be a Fresno weekend dinner hot spot, but it's been a while.  Upon entry, we are still greeted with the odor of mildew. Inescapable and unmistakable mildew. Broken pipe or leaky roof, it's been over a year and they can't get rid of that smell. Or won't fix the leak.  IDK, but it's nauseating. They have multiple air fresheners hidden around, so your dinner is punctuated with either overwhelming mildew or overwhelming Moroccan Bazaar. Trigger alert warning to those with sensitivities, allergies, or asthma. Ugh. But, Brussels sprouts. Although every table in sight is set and empty, the hostess had both our party of 4 and the party of 2 ahead wait a few minutes to be seated. She was not terribly welcoming for a hostess, although she did go through the scripted motions of asking about our visit while she walked quickly to our booth, even though one of our party was using a walker.  Maybe she's new. Our cheery waitress did not bother to mention that she wouldn't bring the actual Long Island Iced Tea ordered, but some pink cranberry tea concoction instead. (It's okay that they're different.  But that's a conversation you have BEFORE you bring the beverage. You don't just bring something else.)  She also took two orders for Brussels sprouts and an order for wedge salad with balsamic dressing, and started a conversation about how everyone was ordering balsamic lately and so she wondered if it was ""a thing"".  Might be important to note that she didn't offer the dressing options with salad orders and left me guessing at dressing until I picked one they have.  Okay, but Brussels sprouts. A few minutes later she stopped by to tell us her shift was over, lingering weirdly and uncomfortably in the process.  Then replacement waiter Eric(?) brought a wedge salad with ranch and bleu cheese.  Upon inquiry, Eric says that they don't have balsamic. Any kind of balsamic. At all. So that whole thing was weird when it didn't have to be, thanks to BA staff. Who was fibbing about balsamic salad dressing, and WHY WOULD YOU BOTHER, for Pete's sake?  No apology for the misunderstanding. Or acknowledgement of any issue, really.Then Eric returns again and brings a menu and says, oh by the way? We have run out of Brussels sprouts. Please pick something else. ""As you can see, we are very bus..."" Eric turns towards the dining room and starts to gesture to an empty room and breaks off- ""Er, we were very busy last night and (mumble mumble) ran out of sprouts."" Drops menu, flees before we can ask questions.  Um.  By now you've been open 4 hours,  we've been here an hour, we ordered 30+ minutes ago, and you're just now noticing you're out? Okay, well planned and even better handled, professional restaurant people. I was there for the sprouts, so didn't order any replacement. My friend got asparagus. Eric helpfully pointed out that they'd removed both $1 upcharges even though her asparagus was a ""premium"" sidekick Astounding $1 generosity to us for YOUR mistake, thanks so much. Actually found it more insulting that you said it and thought we'd be impressed at a dollar off a $150 check.  Then he tells us a story of how someone ordered five orders of sprouts last night, as if that's why they ran out. I'm sure that happened, eyeroll. Beverage snafu, salad snafu, weird dressing snafu, sprout inventory snafu, customers sufficiently disappointed as to reject replacement offered.  Requires at minimum a conciliatory tone, recompense for missing item, some additional offer (small discount (more than one dollar)? comp dessert?) for having not provided the customer experience suggested by adverts+menu+staff, plus additional sincere apologies offered at appropriate intervals and opportunities, in recognition that this is not how you usually do business. At least, this is the kind of response to error that happens at reputable establishments. When you've dropped the ball on the customer, you make an extra effort to acknowledge and repair the situation. There are ways to handle these issues. This was not the way.  If this is a franchise, corporate needs to step in because you are tarnishing their midrange casual steakhouse brand. And imagine the difficulty of that. We'll skip this Black Angus. I don't like this kind of customer service. Don't like fibs. Don't like my intelligence insulted.  Hope things improve there."
1885,2,"Came here because my wife said it had good reviews. I brought like 12 dress shirts to get dry cleaned. All the shirts were fine except one, one of my favorites, had some kind of ink stain spread out on the back. I brought the shirt back and they tried but couldn't remove it. So when I talked to the owner about what happens when something gets stained she was very rude, blaming me for the stain, accusing me that I knew of the stain before I brought it in. How dare she! Is this the way to treat customers?????? Definitely NOT going back! Oh well can't win them all."
1886,1,Don't I repeat DON'T get your alterations done here they are overly priced and you don't get what you want mainly because of the language barrier. I asked for a slit to be put I to my dress and hem done I paid 50 bucks and my dress is only ONE layer. Dry cleaning experiences have been good there however.
1887,2,Really upset. They are nice but are so archaic and need to step it up...also update your hours....why does the Internet say your open on Saturdays and Sundays but you never are? Sorry I am going to be taking my husbands clothes to another facility.
1888,2,My husband and I take his laundry into this place every other week and spend at least $60-75 each time. I asked about coupons or military/law enforcement discounts. They said they don't offer any discounts at all!I went in today and asked if I could have the prices for garments and the attendant acted very annoyed by having to provide me that information. I felt rushed with every further question I asked him. I was trying to determine whether or not I was going to continue taking my laundry here. They made my decision very easy! They just lost a big chunk of money for having a bad attitude!
1889,2,On 1/17/18 I took I'm my royal blue dress shirt and a grey vest.  The shirt was dirt from neck normal nothing exaggerated. I asked for that part to look clean nothing else was wrong with my shirt or vest.  Well first they told me it would be ready by 2:00 pm since I paid for rush cleaning. Well when I went to pick up they only rushed done item and couldn't find the other.   Finally when they called me to pick up at 4:00pm  I saw they neck on shirt and it was faded. This is a week old shirt.  I asked why it was faded they said. Because of my sweat faded the shirt. Look at picture. What ever they did screwed up the color. Never again.
1890,2,"Not happy. Multiple times, clothes returned back with same stains on them. Even after pointing them out. Too expensive to keep coming back and clothes still dirty."
1891,1,"They repeatedly lose items. The items you do get back have stains they didn't even have when dropped off. Then the lady at counter tells you she wasn't the one who lost it, it's not her fault so you're SOL.  Don't go there."
1892,3,"Be careful, I took 4 dress shirts to dry clean, and they lost one! still 3 weeks later with nothing by excuses they are stalling to pay for their mistake, it was one if my fav shirts, they had my wife take home another shirt even though she said it was not mine until they could find it? sufice to say we returned the unknown shirt! very unprofessional and outdated system... I will update this if I get some very needed fair customer service."
1893,2,"Brought in some items to be cleaned before a business trip. I was guaranteed the items would be ready the day before the trip. I explain that if they couldn't be ready on that day, I'd just keep them and clean them when I arrived. They again said it would be no problem. The day before the trip, I still hadn't received a text saying they were ready so I went to the store and asked. The lady casually tells me they'll be ready tomorrow after 4. WHAT!! I explained the situation and that I was told they'd be ready today.  She said we have two items ready. The rest you can get tomorrow. Umm, I'll be across the country tomorrow and I'll only have two things to wear for a week. She ended up finding the rest of the clothing wadded up waiting to be cleaned. She handed them to me in a clump and said I'd still have to pay for them since they started the process. No apologies or anything. No customer service. Wish I didn't have to give them a star at all. Will never come here again."
1894,3,"Not great but probably the only decent place in Fresno to get your clothes dry cleaned. My clothes often come back shrunk or faded even though I ask for dry clean only.  If they're going to go against my instructions,  at least call me and ask for permission to laundry vs dry clean etc. This is Fresno so I'm aware I can't expect excellent or outstanding service."
1895,2,Will never use them again. Drapes did not look clean. Did not give price until I picked them up and I could have bought new ones for same price. I give them a zero rating.  It is not fair that rating must be given when you are not satisfied.
1896,1,"My experience is specifially for alterations:I decided to take a blouse that needed to be altered to Jones Cleaning Services and was not a good experience. Blouse was with Jones Cleaning Services for 2.5 weeks and I had to call to see if it was ready (received no call for pick up). Went to go pick it up and realized there was still a hole in the blouse. I was told to leave it again and that it would be ready in a couple more days. I'm thinking ""sure no problem"". Following Monday comes and finally receive a call for pick up. Went to pick it up later that afternoon and was told that it wasn't ready (seriously?). Next day I call and was told it was ready and I go again to pick it up and was told it wasn't ready. I had to go three attempts for pick up and little did I know it was in the store the whole time. Their system tracking is horrible which causes me to drive over three times within three days. Worst part was the employees in the front were going to charge me still. Wouldn't recommend for alterations. In the end, I never want to wear this blouse again given the fact with my horrible alteration experience here."
1897,3,"Very early this AM I received a voice mail from this company stating that ""Smokey the Bear"" was ready for pick-up. I have  received 2 previous calls from them over the past several months and informed them that they have the wrong number and that I do not own said item. Both times I was assured  that my number would be removed from their records. They are obviously too busy  to attend to such small details so I decided to return their call and asked for Joleen, I heard the person who answered the phone tell Joleen that I was on the phone and was told that Joleen was in a meeting. That is unfortunate because up to this point I was giving this business the benefit of the doubt, now I know better."
1898,1,"If I could give 0 stars I would. However, I feel people should be warned. My husband recently dropped his suits off at this dry cleaning place on 3/5/19 I left my money in his suit pocket. My mistake yes. However, this business stole my $800 dollars. They are dishonest and apparently employe thieves. When I called and tried to speak to Joleen the manager I'm told they can't give me back what they didn't find and supposedly the girl who checked my husbands suits in had given her two weeks notice and quit. I'm beyond upset!"
1899,2,"They do great work. But when you show up at 6 on the dot, and they close at 6, but they are locked up and won't answer the door ... and then the cashier peaks up from hiding behind the counter and ducks back down, it really sucks. Thanks for making my mad dash to get my bridesmaid dress from you worth it, Mastercraft! I believe in supporting natural businesses but I will not be back."
1900,3,Came here to get my long split closed up on my dress. Yesterday I picked it up and this was the outcome. They did not match it up with the closure of the dress. Charged me $10 for that and $8.00 to dry clean. What a waste of money. Now I have to go Arlettes in Upland to have it done the right way!
1901,1,Awful product. Took new pants to this cleaner. See pic. They did the worst homemade looking job on the hem. I specifically asked him to match the existing hem. Now my trendy slim leg pant looks like the uniform from a restaurant or janitorial service. This place is under new ownership and needs to be out of business.
1902,1,"If I could give this guy ZERO Stars I would. I walked into this place today to survey the place and check out prices. When I walked in I saw a price list on the wall. I was mostly  interested in the pricing of laundering and pressing dress shirts and dry cleaning of my slacks. This older Asian man walks out from the back and I ask him if the prices listed are correct because I could barely read the writing penciled in on the 8.5 x 11"" sheet on the wall. The man, looking suspiciously at me, asks me why I'm there at his place. (I wasn't there to order a pizza!). I let him know I just moved into the area and was looking for a dry cleaner and laundry service. He looks at me again suspiciously and tells me there are other places that I can go to that are cheaper like the 99 cents dry cleaner down the street. (That was rude, you jerk!) All I was asking for was the pricing. So I asked him again if the  pricing listed on the sheet is correct. He tells me, ""It depends."" I asked him, what does it depend on? He tells me that my shirts are too big and he would charge me $4.50 per dress shirt as he walks away from me back into the shop. That's double than what usually pay. I looked at him in amazement and thought to myself what an idiot this Mr Miagi jerk is and just walked out. Am I pissed? Yup! Will I ever come back to this place again? Absolutely NOT! Should you? Not if you want the most crappy treatment in dry cleaning and laundering. This idiot acts like he's doing you a favor...disgusted by his attitude..."
1903,1,I have been coming here for 4 years and never have I had such horrible service as I have had today. I put a big load of clothes to was as well as a body pillow at the same time different washers. my clothes finished but my pillow started over. I asked the people who works here what the problem was but they couldn't tell me at all. they basically blamed me for it. saying that it started in the middle of the cycle. I'm not some stupid idiot I know where the wash starts from. so here I am an hour and a half into my visit here and my pillow still isn't done. lesson learned. don't come here ever again. so to those of you who ever want to come here DON'T.
1904,2,"Extremely rude workers!!. Alot of the machinery does not work. The lady who works there started to take the washing powder out of my washers without asking or telling me there was an issue. I never had this issue at any other wash house about the amount of soap I was using. A customer there, who was very helpful said it was because if it was too much soap and the washer will leak. Okay First, she should have kindly told us that or had a sign up about the amount of soap to use. My grandmother and I could not even wash in peace, her and her husband had bad attitudes and customer service as a whole. We would have left if we had not already started the wash. And when we were finally leaving, we had a lot to load in the car. The lady who works there ran out the wash house to snatch the laundry carts away before we can bring them back in. She did not do that with any of the other customers. The free dry is not worth it, especially when alot of the equipment did not work as they should and their customer service is that bad. I only went there because its close to where I live. I will never go again nor will I reccommend it. They seriously need to work on their people skills. Anytime someone spend $40 to wash at your business, they should at least be respectful."
1905,1,"Worst dirty laundry mat in town will never go here again. Bath room out of order and graffiti in bath room still letting people use it. So many machines out of order, cockroaches. Do not reccomend to anyone. So what its free dry its a disgusting place. City needs to be called on this place."
1906,1,They are crooks They take advantage of people in some of there worst nitemare situations I never dreamed after my house caught fire that someone could take advantage of people like they have My insurance provider insisted they come and how they were there to help .. They should all be ashamed.   So now we are living another nitemare dealing with these crooks.
1907,1,I really wanna help other ppl avoid what i have been going throw !!!My insurance send this company to my house.They came and claim that all the clothes and shoes they taking gonna come back even in a better shape then the day I purchased them !

1908,1,"The short version:   DO NOT LET THIS COMPANY ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR TEXTILES, NEVER, EVER.   THEY ARE THE WORST.  Please note that CRDN is a franchise business and this review applies only to CRDN of Central California, with locations in Fresno and Carmel, CA.  This company destroyed many items and then denied any responsibility for the damage to my items.   I had photographic proof for many items that were damaged, having taken pictures for a post fire inventory.   The owner, a Ryan Hanson called me after weeks of me leaving messages and hearing nothing back.   There was no apology, no admission of responsibility, he appeared not to care one bit at how much distress this had caused me, especially since some items that were destroyed were of huge sentimental value, such as blanket used by our son while he was dying of bone cancer.   It took me nearly three months to get a response from CRDN of Central California.   And in the end all of the damaged items were  deemed unsalvageable and my insurance ended up reimbursing me for them, which I did not want them to do.   I wanted CRDN to take responsibility for what they had done.The long version:On July 22, 2016 a wildfire started in a remote section of Northern Big Sur, CA.   Four days later that fire, known as the Soberanes Fire burned to the back of our house.   I am volunteer firefighter here, in an all volunteer department and after four days with out sleep, I worked all night to defend our house, finally spraying it with a gel that prevented it from burning before leaving and hoping it would survive.   That night I worked harder than I had ever worked in my life.   I slept for 15 hours and when I woke, I called my fire chief to find out if my house had survived, and it had, thanks to my work and that of a Calfire crew.Though the house was saved, we had severe smoke and ash damaged.  Our house is a typical Big Sur cabin style house and living in a place where it never gets too cold or hot, well it is not sealed that well and there was a 1/16 inch coating of ash on everything and when I walked in the next day, the smoke was so thick I could not see 15 feet in front of me.All of our textiles where thick with the smell of smoke.  We hired one company to clean the interior of the house and they brought along a rep from CRDN of Central California.  The rep was super friendly and positive. So I decided to use them.  My items were suppose be cleaned and returned within two weeks tops and the rep said probably within one week.   It ended up taking over six weeks.   When they were returned I was very excited, as this was the bulk of our clothing, having only evacuated a few outfits, which we were pretty sick of wearing.   We were still living in a rental house as our home was still in the process of being cleaned and repaired from the fire damage.When I started opening boxes my heart sank.   I found that they had ruined many items.  Many items had holes in them, some were torn, others had scorch marks.   Sweaters were hung on wire hangers and the shoulders were stretched beyond repair often with holes in them where the hanger dug through the knit material.   I found that our rugs, while being returned in plastic bags, had not been cleaned at all and still contained ash.  Things were shrunk, things that were dry clean only had been washed.  About 25% of our items were ruined.I reported all of this to our rep and he was at first all positive about making it right.  He picked up the rugs, but when he did this he started to change his attitude.   He went from making it right to telling me that our stuff was in bad shape when they picked it up, that it was old, that is was not their fault.   In essence he started to blame me.   It was awful.  He then stopped returning calls.   He quit or so I was told and after 5 weeks a new rep contacted me.   She came out and took pictures and said she was sorry that all of this had happened and she would get a resolution for me within a week.  I think she truly believed that she would be able to do that.It took another 3-4 weeks before I finally heard from the owner of CRDN of Central California, Randy Hansen.  He made a deal with my insurance company, CRDN sent over a list of items that were unsalvageable and my insurance company would send me a check for them.   I told him I did not want them to pay, that CRDN was responsible.  He interrupted me and told me that there would be no conversation about this, this is what is happening.   He was arrogant, rude, unfriendly and appeared to be completely uncaring as to what I had been through and contemptuous of me. I am writing this in hopes of saving others from the horrible experience we had.  While our insurance compensated us for most of the loss, there is no way to repair or put a price on something like the blanket your dying child used.To me it appears that this franchise and it's owners care about only one thing, money.   Please  do not give them yours."
1909,2,"We came here to meet friends on a Saturday night.  Most of the lounge was taken up by a private party, they should have just closed the whole thing.  They were so loud, the music could not be split between the rooms so we could hardly hear each other talk.  I realize as part of the hotel they probably need to have a section open for guests but it was really annoying and give the location to easy to find another place to walk to.The worst part was the bartender didn't know how to make a martini, she took out her phone to google it, no joke.  This is supposed to be a place for great artisan cocktails.  Perhaps this was an off night, but not coming back given the experience."
1910,3,"Where's Mike?  Came here with friends who raved about the experience with the ""mad scientist"" of bartending.  It seems that ownership has changed for the worse.  Nothing special about the drinks... food was really bad (I got soggy and limp fries), and service was slow.  If it's new ownership... they should have learned to make drinks better than a dive bar.  Hoping it turns around... could be a cool place."
1911,3,"ehhh, came here last night with a couple friends after movies at kabuki down the street to try their cocktails. i've heard rave reviews from another friend who have been coming regularly, so i was excited to try it out! it was a tuesday so understandably it was a little quiet.  sat at the bar. i started with a mezcal drink that was definitely on the more sweet/fruity side, but with a kick.  this was okay.  my friend got a rum spirit-forward one that he didnt enjoy - it also came with a giant leaf of something aromatic in it. generally dont like leafy garnishes in my cocktails.  my second mezcal drink wasnt as good - but def more spirit forward like i had requested.  and then we ended the evening with negroni's - perfectly easy to make right? wrong. these were not delicious. i can see how butterfly lounge could appeal to people - you walk in, park yourself, tell them what flavors you enjoy and the liquor of choice, and a perfectly tailored cocktail should magically appear. the operative word though is - should. meeps! i'll probably not return for a while."
1912,2,"I really wanted to give this place a better review, but just can't...  My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary over the weekend.  The place is super cute and we were looking forward to the ""cozy"" atmosphere of the place.  We walked into the room and it was HOT and stuffy.  No air conditioning...  Since we understood it's an older place and usually not needed in the city, we were ok to deal with it.  To cool the room down, we needed to open all the windows in the place, again not too big of a deal, until you realize your fellow hotel mates are loud and smoking outside of their rooms which goes directly into your room.  As we were getting ready for bed, we pulled down the sheets and were shocked to see something in the bed.  A used condom, a plastic glove, not too sure, but it was definitely used and filled with some substance.  We went down to the office to request clean sheets and were unable to find anyone, there was also no way to call.  This resulted in us taking the sheets off the bed and laying on towels.  At almost $200 for the night, sleeping on towels in a hot room with noisy neighbors and cigarette smoke in my room wasn't what I was hoping for.When checking out the next morning, we let them know how we were disappointed in our stay and of the unclean shits and ""item"" left in the bed.  All we got was a ""Sorry!"".We will not be staying here again and would not recommend it to others."
1913,3,"Last week, I decided to spend some time at the beach aspect of San Francisco, where I live downtown. It was time to reintroduce the beach to Guinness, my deserved and devoted companion. I carefully chose to reserve room at the best reviewed of the four motel options for my partner, myself and companion dog to nest in, The Ocean Park Motel. After speaking with Chester, at the front desk,  a two room suite seemed perfectly suited to the needs of we three. It was somewhat costly for me but worth the $165 per night to secure a pleasant accomodation from Sun-Wed.Just after check-in time, we arrived at the motel, fresh of the L train, toting four days of luggage and my elated to smell the fresh sea aire, doggie, Guinness. I felt like we were on a mini-retreat. Our excitement was shattered however, in moments after our arrival. Chester informed us that the plumbing had ""gone out"" in the two room + bathroom suite that we had reserved. I was shocked and asked why he didn't try to call and let me know so that we could have avoided the trek over and made other plans. He said, ""Oh, I just found out about this problem myself about an hour ago."" I said, surely there must be another type of room we could occupy for the four nights? He said again, ""oh no, we are all booked up for the next four nights."" He may has well of turned over a big ""closed"" sign in our faces because it was clear there was nothing he was willing to do to accomodate us or realize our plight. Needless to say, I ended up in tears of sadness and frustration because of the preparation involved and the enthusiasm that needed to be squashed and reevaluated. I cannot say how much I felt as though he did not like the outfit I was wearing, if it was that he prejudged my service dog to be bad because he is a bigger breed, if my breath smelled bad or just what I had done in such a quick period of time that could have rubbed him so wrong? Is it just me? It seems so, because the other reviewers boast of the staff's ""friendliness."""
1914,3,"This place is really nice, clean and some rooms have a kitchen. My review is only bad because they should have reserved parking spots for each room. I couldn't find any parking the night of my stay there, street parking wasn't available and had to park two blocks away in a tiny spot that looked sketchy. I really only stayed here because it included the parking which would make it totally worth it if I didn't have to go through that again. But don't think I will be staying here again till they fix the parking situation."
1915,3,"The elderly person at the ticket booth was extremely rude.I was taking my in-laws walking around the Fisherman's Wharf area when we came across this ship. It wasn't in our plan to visit it since we were just checking things out along the way to our parked car. After we asked about the ticket price and decided not to go on, the person at the ticket booth said ""You can leave now"". That was very rude and uncalled for. We weren't even getting on the ship and was leaving without him making a rude comment immediately after we thanked him for letting us know the price."
1916,3,"I'm writing this review because I received an email from Jeremiah O'Brien asking me to write it. 
We'd planned to attend the fleet week event on the ship and purchased tickets. My father turned very ill the night before, so I called and emailed them multiple times. I got no response. I asked for credit for next year or even a tax donation receipt. Again- no response. Given that we spent hundreds of dollars, the very least they could do is respond."
1917,3,"Went on the cruise for Fleet Week. The cruise leaves at 10 and returns at 5:00. It goes under the  Golden Gate bridge and then around to the Bay bridge. You board the ship at 9:00. There are limited chairs for sitting and everything is in full sun. They serve coffee, doughnuts, muffins, orange juice, and water for breakfast.  Lunch is a foot long hot dog, chips and ice cream. Beer, wine and sodas are provided. There is a band but can only be heard at the front of the ship. No speakers at the back section. The gift shop, museum and engine room are open during the cruise. Volunteers run everything. The ship is in the Bay for the airshow. It's a great place to watch the Blue Angels and other acrobatic pilots. They have commentary during the airshow but the speakers kept going out. Every thing was fine except parking in shed A.  Do not park there for the Fleet Week cruise. It took over 2 hours to get out of the lot. The attendant had to take everyone's paid ticket and leave the gate open since they only give you fifteen minutes to exit. There is no one directing traffic getting out of this garage. Hundreds of cars waiting hours to get out is ridiculous. The SFPD made this worse by not stopping traffic so cars could exit the garage   Take bart and walk or the f line. Just skip this event if you need to drive. The parking nightmare made this nice event terrible.  The two stars is because of the parking nightmare. The cruise itself was four stars."
1918,2,"Booked a four night stay last week and walked out after three simply awful nights .My room was on the street side of the Inn,Basically it felt like you were sleeping on the street .Windows are paper fine.  First morning I had a water pressure cleaner generator directly under my window at 6am .Every night around midnight, a truck , again directly parked underneath my window , which for a full hour was being filled with every bottle from every restaurant and bar in Hayes Valley .The worst room I've ever stayed in .The staff didn't care , also wrote the manager aemail ( Marina ?) no reply .You get what you pay for .Never staying here again , ruined my holiday ."
1919,2,"This place was beyond disappointing. A friend recommended it for a quick weekend trip with my sister. The location is the only plus. Great restaurants and shops all around us and we felt safe being out late at night in this area. But thank god we spent barely any time at the hotel. A few of the staff were friendly and helpful, a few were not. My sister asked to have hot water from the kitchen last night because they had just closed it and the lady refused to unlock the door for her. The beds are not comfortable. AC did not work in our room. The sound of the traffic is super loud pretty much all the time, with very thin windows in the whole building. And I've stayed in Euro style hotels in Seattle before but this feels more like a hostel. Here you're sharing two tiny toilet closets and one shower with 10 other rooms on the floor. They don't clean the showers well through the day and it took 10 minutes for the water to heat up. I will pay more $ and stay somewhere else next time."
1920,3,"I booked this room on  HYPERLINK ""https://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" \t ""_blank"" Booking.com mainly because of the wonderful reviews, but also because the website said there was no cancellation fee. Within 2 hours of booking I realized we had a conflict during the same time frame so tried to cancel. Apparently, the ""no cancellation fee"" really meant ""no cancellation"" as I was informed my credit card had already been charged $467. I contacted  HYPERLINK ""https://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" \t ""_blank"" Booking.comand they said that the hotel's website says you absolutely cannot contact them by phone but after much back and forth they agreed to contact the hotel and we were able to change the date of our stay.We arrived at the hotel and it appeared to be exactly as advertised, a quaint European style hotel, with shared bathrooms. No problem. When we checked in, the room we were assigned was in the annex building around the corner in the alley. We opened the door of the building and the smell of Clorox was so strong it made my eyes water and my throat close up. Fortunately, the (barred) windows in the room opened and there was a ceiling fan so we were able to somewhat air out the room while we went out to eat.The room itself was very sparse, no carpeting like in the main building rooms and the floor was sticky. I had forgotten to bring any sort of indoor footwear so I had to wear socks at all times my feet were on the floor. My white socks ended up almost black after a short time. There was also no sink or even a mirror in the room, nor was there a separate ""water closet"" outside of the shared bathroom. So, when someone was taking a shower you just had to hold it or go to the main hotel to relieve yourself.As for the shared bathroom, there was one bathmat for the entire floor (rather than each room having their own that you could take with you when you showered) which is really gross. The floor was usually wet and the bathmat ended up soaked in a pile in the corner. I saw it this way twice but I'm not sure if it was the same mat left more than one day or if it was a different mat that ended up there two days in a row. I think it might have been the former because there was a glass on top of a cabinet the day we checked in, along with a small bar of soap, a toothbrush and a small tube of toothpaste on a windowsill that never moved the 3 days we were there. I finally looked in the glass and it had something crusted on the bottom. Who knows how long it had been sitting there. There was also hair stuck to the wall right next to the sink that I had to look at every time I brushed my teeth. I don't believe the bathroom is thoroughly cleaned on any kind of regular basis.The breakfast was surprisingly good with very good coffee, fresh fruit bowl, yogurt & granola, a variety of cereals, bagels & pastries, juice and meat and cheese platter. The staff was friendly and when I voiced my complaints about the state of the annex building they refunded me 10% of my stay. I would probably try staying in one of the main building rooms in the future but there is no possibility I would ever stay in the annex building again."
1921,3,"This hotel reminds me of a European hotel with the small rooms but with non of the charm. I did not like it at all. Although it was inexpensive ($100 a night) for San Francisco standards I would never use the hotel again unless desperate.  The carpet was old and dirty and all through the hotel. I was afraid to go barefoot in my room. The hallway to the rooms looked like an old college dormitory with dirty, old carpet!  The service was good but the hotel clerks were behind a window as if they needed protection from what?  It made me feel uncomfortable.  The area was great but it was depressing having to go back to the hotel. Clean your carpets or change to hardwood!!!  Also no amenities in the rooms like hair dryer, soaps, or shampoo."
1922,3,"This hotel truly is a disgrace. From the outside it looks very trendy and hip. The lobby hides the reality as well. We stayed in room 115 and checked out after one night. The room was filthy. Cobb webs on the ceilings. My wife did some dusting and the washcloth was black. It looked like a storage room with some office chairs thrown in the corner. The headboard was not even attached to the bed or wall. It just banged around. The bed had to be 20 years old. It was completely collapsed and stained and you literally could not move without it making a loud abrasive noise. And, there is no parking. You are told to drive around the surrounding neighborhoods. Good luck!"
1923,3,"I don't understand why this hotel gets such high reviews. Walking to our room the first thing I thought was, ""Man this place is freaking haunted I know it..."" As I open the door I was immediately stunned at how small the room was. I understand it is San Francisco, but damn! It was basically 1 full bed with about a foot of space around each side of it. In true San Francisco like fashion, the window the the left of the bed gave clear view of somebody's home. I tried to get some sleep, but the walls are so thin it's ridiculously impossible to get any when you hear conversations of everybody within the floor (or was it a ghost...) On the bright side, the bathrooms are clean and the towels not so dingy. This is okay for one person who doesn't care about space, but it could get claustrophobic with even 2."
1924,3,"I've been going here for dinner for 20 years because it has Bob's steakhouse. Finally decided to stay and host two friends I had not seen in ages. Ordered a wine and cheese tray for the room so we could all have one glass of wine and catch up. Wine arrived, but it was the wrong wine, replacement wine was the brought with no wine opener or glasses.  Cheese arrived 45  minutes later after several calls to front desk, but there was no knife to cut the Brie cheese so we had to tear pices of the  gooey cheese apart with our fingers. Of course they gave us no napkins either. For this i paid $50 plus tip. Thanks for nothing."
1925,1,"8/10/2018 Worst part of my wedding day. We booked a room at the Omni San Francisco through Priceline for our wedding night, and the receptionist said they were giving us a room on the nice 7th floor. The 7th floor is outdated, and our room was dirty and surprisingly small. There was a blood stain on the curtain and the tub had black stains/marks. Additionally, they put us in an interior room where our view was two sides of the hotel and an office sky scraper. If that wasn't disappointing enough, the yellow light that emanated into our room from the office building kept us up all night. To finish the experience, the hotel charged me directly a mystery $75 fee. Strongly do not recommend this hotel or Priceline. There are better deals at nicer hotels with updated and clean interior."
1926,2,"Very bad experience with this hotel!We were staying there this past weekend, in room 434.I have called in in advance saying that we want a room with 2 beds, they said they will arrange it. Then when we checked in, they said they don't have any rooms with 2 beds available. then I requested to add a rollaway bed. A few minutes later, they bring in a $20 inflatable air mattress. They blow in up in the room for us. Well the mattress is also deflatable. 2 hours later, the air mattress flat to the floor. Then I remembered when the guys were inflating the air mattress, they noticed something was wrong with the air mattress, they were chatting secretly about something quietly, and I couldn't hear what they were talking. Now the air mattress deflated to the ground, I understand everything they did.Never come to Omni again."
1927,3,"My wife's brother had a birthday in the city and even though we live in East Bay, we booked this room because we wanted to sleep nearby.I didn't have much to drink but my wife, who is not a drinker, had too much and was carsick on the way to the hotel.  I did not think she could walk back from Union Square garage so I dropped her off at the door.When I got back to the hotel, the lady working the desk informed me that since I was not registered to the room, and we could not raise my wife on the room phone or her personal phone because she had passed out, I would not be allowed in.  When I said that I supposed I'd be sleeping in the hallway, and started to settle in, she explained that she did not need this attitude and threatened to call the police.  At that point I decided I was better off driving home, but it defeated the purpose of renting a room.I understand that I could be a jealous husband or some stalker, so she couldn't exactly let me into a random person's room, but I hope my wife is alive in the morning and doesn't die from alcohol poisoning.  The last words I heard from her were, ""Please help me, I'm scared"".Me too, honey, me too.Update: Next time, maybe there's something else you can do, like... check to see if she rented the room for two people, send someone up to her room to wake her and see if she's okay with me staying, or at least offer to check on her and make sure she's still breathing."
1928,3,"This is going to be a roller-coaster of a review. We arrived late on Wednesday night and the welcome was very warm. The room was  little smaller that I expected, but was neat, clean and comfortable. The TV was above average and all the little welcome chocolates and little notes were a nice touch. The bed was terrible and by morning we were in pain. I mentioned to staff and we were upgraded to a slightly larger room with a much more comfortable bed. I very much appreciated this. Our belongings were moved for us while we were at lunch and unfortunately the shirts in the wardrobe and bathroom stuff were forgotten - no worries, they were soon retrieved and we were given a complementary bottle of champagne and some chocolates and a lovely note of apology - again - great service.The rest of the stay was wonderful, except for needing ice and... the icemaker was broken.It all went wrong at checkout. I had paid for the whole trip in advance on Orbitz. However, after leaving, I got a text from my bank saying that the hotel had changed my credit card ($30 + $30 + $1199.73 = $1259). This is a significant amount of money for me. I called the hotel and they apologized citing a 'new computer system'. In an effort to reverse the error - imagine my disbelief when they charged another $1169.73 I called again, more apologies. The hotel called me back an hour later telling me everything was fixed. When I checked with my bank they have changed me an additional $1200. I now have more than $3628 of bogus changed on my credit card as of 24 hours after the incident. STILL NOT FIXEDThis outrageous treatment has left me feeling very sick about the entire stay at this hotel. It is very sad that I have been treated in this way.6/9   Update: STILL NOT FIXED6/10 Update: STILL NOT FIXED6/11 Update: Partly fixed, $1229.73 still owed to me6/12 Update: $1229.73 still owed to me6/12 Update Received the apology comment (see below) from the General Manager saying that everything was processed at their end but working its way through my bank (out of the Hotel's control) Then received a phone call of apology from the Manager Ken stating the reverse i.e. they made another mistake and the refund was not processed correctly. He has now (6/12) fixed that.6/13 Update: Still no money back in my bank $1229.73 still owed6/14 Update: No change, $1229.73 still owed6/15 Update: No change, $1229.73 still owed6/16 FINAL UPDATE - Fixed!"
1929,3,"THE INN AT UNION SQUARES COMMENT: ""8/10/2016  Dear Kim,Thank you for taking the time to leave your thoughts of our hotel.  I am sorry that you did not feel that your experience with us was exceptional, as we strive for that with every stay.  With regard to your points, we make it very clear that parking can be expensive in downtown San Francisco, but we do have the convenience of valet parking for fee so that you do not have to find a lot (with varying rates and hours of operations) on your own.  Because of congestion in our area, in can indeed take some time to retrieve a valeted car, although we make abundant attempts to communicate that from the moment that a guest arrives; I hope that that was the case with your stay.  I will say, I am very sorry that the incorrect vehicle was brought up; because we work with a third party for our valet needs, there may have been a breakdown in communication, but that should never have affected you, so I am deeply sorry that that was the case, which is why the parking fee was waived.  San Francisco was peculiarly warm during your stay and we do have multiple fans in each room as a contingency for unexpectedly warm days; we also have additional fans that we could have brought to the room upon request.  We do not advertise our rooms as having mini fridges, so I am sorry that you had expected one; while we have a handful that are available upon request, I am happy to say that our rooms will be undergoing an update later this year (much like the bathrooms had just a few months ago) which will indeed bring mini fridges to all of the rooms.I am sad to know that you did not try our complimentary breakfast or wine and cheese reception, as guests thoroughly enjoy both of these included amenities; they are two of the features that distinguishes us.I hope that when you are traveling to San Francisco again, that you give us another try so that you can experience the exception service that is normally our hallmark.Thank you again.Best regards,Ramon SerranoGeneral Manager""MY UPDATE (since you can't respond to comments?):Bottom line: don't book solely based on reviews. You need to read their website regarding parking (because like I said - don't even bother with a car, just take a taxi!). And apparently you need to read their website regarding what is in the rooms because $260 a night doesn't include things like A/C in the summer or a mini fridge to put your leftovers from the restaurant downstairs. Shame on me for assuming that a hotel charging that much doesn't have the accommodations others that are significantly cheaper do."
1930,2,"This is a three star hotel that charges five star prices. The Alise and Hotwire should be ashamed of themselves. Purchased a blind two night two room stay for more than $200 a night per room ($220 to be exact) precisely because I wanted to ensure that it would be a known  hotel brand (as  advertised on Hotwire). Nope. Mayor misleading and false advertisement on their part and mischaracterization of the hotel itself by the brand. Never again will I stay at the Alise and never again will I purchase travel through Hotwire.  The Alise is a three star hotel, a nice one (not saying otherwise) but it's a scandal that they market themselves as a four/borderline star place. Again, it's a nice enough place but it's NOT  $220 a night hotel. There is no tub, service can be deficient (a single, slow as a snail person at the check in/check out during peak rush hours) and there were repairs and plastic sheets covering the lobby. The AC is noisy at times and the vacuum cleaners run at any point throughout the day right outside your room. But, honestly, what REALLY pissed me off, after having paid $220 a night for what should be a $100-120 room, was that the Alise doesn't even offer a complimentary cup of coffee or water in your room. Nope. Instead, they will charge you $25 for the room coffee and water. Great way to start the day (not). And in addition to charging you $25 for water or coffee, they also put in a great amount of effort trying to sell you all kinds of stuff with a pineapple logo (cups, stuffed animals, robes, etc).Oh! They will also charge you for Wi-Fi, slippers, bathrobe (they are listed as 'amenities' but the lady at the check in told us we would get charged if we used any of the listed items). To be honest, it was so absurd that I was afraid to use the towels and soap, lest I be charged (I wasn't, but good lord, this place is scandalous)."
1931,3,"The neighborhood isn't ""iffy"". It's downright bad. Pretty much the Tenderloin!  Not where a couple single women can feel safe. I lived in SF from 2008-2016 and should have known better but it looks closer to Powell on the Bookings.com map than it is. Booked for two nights but when I tried to leave after one the person at the front desk told me she didn't know how to help me do that!  No ice machines. Goofy bedding. Tiny rooms and tinier bathrooms. $25 amenity fee per day for stuff that is worth $5.   It is clean. The staff are nice but don't seem to know their jobs very well."
1932,3,"Rooms are tiny, my view on the top floor was the wall of the other side of the building, shower has a half glass instead of a curtain and they have this really weird half blanket and no top sheet on the bed. Also no gym on site so you have to go somewhere else to workout.Forgot to mention there is a $25 per day resort fee which they never told me about. Wouldn't exactly call this place a resort. Oh and I also got a $150 charge for nothing which they have no explanation for and is apparently being refunded to Expedia (where I booked this place) even though it was charged to me. Who knows if I will get my money back. This place is terrible. They send you a link to review the place after and it doesn't even work which is the least surprising part of my whole experience with them."
1933,2,"We stayed at the metropolitan Suite for New Years Eve! Dec 31, 2018 Overall Hotel is magnificent, but we experienced discrimination/racism once we checked in.  The hotel concierge, was very rude checking us in, were spending over $1000. You would think there customer service would be exceptional. He didn't even offer us any champagne. Total Jerk...Room is huge and we had a lovely view. The security man (short African American chubby)  with glasses kept eyeing us in the lobby. Me and my family felt very uncomfortable, like we didn't belong there. The next morning , we were waiting for our car from valet, that took over a hour. While I was waiting I asked the front desk to use the restroom. The woman blatantly said "" Bathrooms are for our guest only"" what?. Today is Jan 27, 2019 I got charged for 1500 for damages!! stating the damages over bath bomb in the bath? juice spilled? insane! I will never ever stay at the st. Regis ever again with my family. I experienced emotional distress. This makes me so upset because this is a luxurious hotel and I wanted to treat me and my family."
1934,1,"FALSE ADVERTISING!!We stayed here under false pretenses. I booked this trip as a surprise birthday getaway for my fiance. Needless to say, it didn't turn out quite as we had hoped. We had no idea that protests would be happening the entire time and that certain services that we had expected (for paying top dollar), were not available. This was NOT mentioned online or on their website when you book so BEWARE when you are paying $600-1000+/night that basic amenities are currently not available. Such as room service, including any prepaid breakfast options, ""real"" breakfast in general, dinner and the restaurant. The ""continental breakfast"" provided was disgusting and the same quality you would find at a motel, not what you would expect from a 5 star luxury hotel. Though I wouldn't say it's the cook's fault.. it's the hotel's fault for providing cheap & crappy ingredients to work with.I paid an extra $120 for breakfast to be delivered to our room, as a surprise for my fiance. They quickly mentioned it wouldn't be available because of the protests. They didn't offer to refund me, until I requested it. Even still, they credited me back only $75. They did give us complimentary vouchers for the ""continental"" breakfast that was mentioned above.The staff that was there seemed miserable  and the rest were protesting outside. (Though rightfully so and I am thankful for those that did show up to work to help run the place.) It really puts a damper on your stay when you realize you are supporting corrupt corporations by staying there. When in actuality, this was a special, rare occasion and we would have cancelled our reservation, had we not been locked in to a prepaid, non-refundable rate.Another really sad part that you should all consider before staying here-- most of the protesters were elders and/or appeared to most likely be from other countries or POC... is Marriott a company that takes advantage of immigrants, POC and elders? I mean it must be pretty bad if that many people are protesting, nationwide. Think about where you want to spend your hard earned money and more importantly WHO you want to give it to.If Marriott truly does pay their employees unfair wages, we are unlikely to stay at any affiliated hotels, such as St. Regis, again. Especially for the price we paid. Might as well go to the Ritz or Four Seasons... their employees aren't protesting. Or stick with good ole Hilton."
1935,3,"Ugh. I LOVED this hotel. Everything about it was fabulous. Between the rooms and the staff, it was great. Well, except the fact that they underpay their staff. All days in San Fran were accompanied by protests at every Marriott in the area asking for fair, living wages. If I had not been there for a conference that left the entire city closed down, I might have even changed hotels. Although the st. Regis did everything they could to accommodate me as a guest during the protests, they really should be accommodating the staff that help the hotels run day in and day out. Once the protests have concluded, I will happily update my review to discuss the hotel more thoroughly, for now, #UnionStrong!"
1936,2,"I am so confused by the amazing reviews this place has received. My company has this listed as a preferred hotel ((insert side-eye)). The location is good but the rooms are crap! Old and smelly, super dirty carpets, chipped tile on the shower floor, my bed was dented in and on a slope...not comfortable. Someone clearly has not informed the hotel management that it is 2019 because this place is stuck in the 60's and thats probably the last time the carpets were shampooed. I felt like I had itchy skin my entire stay. The rooms look nothing like the photos. It was all just so gross! HOWEVER, the front desk staff was super kind and professional. The restaurant is just ok. I would pass on this place!"
1937,1,If I could I would give no star I would. Hands down worst experience from a hotel I have ever experienced. If I wanted to go into it nahib is not qualified to be working night audit or Hotel Abri should be more concerned with how they direct there employees on how they treat their costumers. When there is a single guest on the room reservation and they show up with one other guest that isn't on the reservation I feel they should be able to accommodate that guest and let them up to the room... apparently not at Hotel Abri. Completely unorthodox on how I have experienced the hospitality industry. Growing up in Napa in the hospitality business I feel Hotel Abri has much to learn about costumer service and hospitality. That being said they probably won't. On top of it I felt like I was treated biased based on my age... despite being young I travel more than most and use Airbnb every month. Take a look at my ratings and you will see my track record with hotels and Airbnb is flawless. I am a seasoned hotel user and Hotel Abri is THE ABSOLUTE WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED AT. They even refused to give me copy's of receipts upon checkout.... I could keep going but I'll just stop since I would rather not devote more of my time and energy to this pathetic hotel.... and btw the restaurant and rooms are a sad and depressing place to start:/
1938,1,"I had an absolutely horrible stay here. While the reviews look good, ladies, if you're traveling for work and want to feel like you're at a safe hotel where your room number won't be given out to strangers and you stuff won't be stolen, DON'T STAY AT HOTEL ABRI.I had a two night stay for a work conference. The first night, I got back late and all three of my key cards would not work. I had to call the front desk and they told me I was probably ""inserting the card the wrong way."" I was really tired and shocked that I had to wait so long to get access to my room.The second night, I took a Lyft line back with other conference goers that I did not know. One of them asked to charge their phone in the lobby since it was dead and I said sure. I went up to my room and called it a night since I had early morning meetings. When I checked out, they said that I had a charge on my room for a bottle of wine, which I did not buy. I asked if someone else had bought it on my account and they said yes but they had to know my room number to charge it. I had not given out my room number, only my first name, so that means that the front desk person had given a COMPLETE STRANGER my room number and allowed them to charge whatever they wanted to my room. I felt really creeped out and unsafe.Lastly, just a few hours after checking out I realized I had left an expensive tailored leather jacket that was a gift from a friend hanging in the closet. I called the front desk on Friday late afternoon and asked them if it had turned up and if someone could check the closet. Their reply? ""It's not on the log and we have to ask house keeping but they're gone for the day."" I asked if they could just check the room and they said they had forwarded my number and housekeeping would call back. Well, I called the next morning on Saturday morning after the next guest had already checked in. The head of housekeeping said ""it wasn't on her log"" and refused to confirm the the room had been physically checked and additionally refused to go check it. She said to call back when the guest had checked out. Well, I called on at 4pm on Saturday and guess what? They told me it still ""wasn't on the log"" and refused to check to closet because ""another guest had checked in."" At this point I was getting  irritated because it shouldn't take two days to check a closet. I repeatedly asked if they could physically go check the closet and she said she would let the front desk ""know"" about my request.On Sunday I got a call in the afternoon from the front desk. They told me that the jacket still wasn't on the log and the the head of housekeeping had (finally) checked the room and it wasn't there. Well, of course it wouldn't be there because it's been three days! I asked if the head housekeeping had physically checked on Friday after I had checked out and he said yes, she had checked after the room had been cleaned and again on Sunday. I was doubtful that the room had been actually checked by the head of housekeeping because I asked her point blank and she wouldn't say if she checked the room. I then asked if they have the record of who cleaned the room because if that's the case, then my jacket was most likely taken by someone on the house keeping staff. The other very likely scenario is it was taken by the next guest. The man said there was NO RECORD of who cleans the individual rooms, which I am also highly doubtful of.So, if you want to stay somewhere that doesn't care about your safety and personal belongings, definitely stay here. Otherwise, stay at the Parc 55 or Hotel Fusion across the street.Update: The hotel manager contacted me and claims that the charge was simply a ""clerical error."" I recommended they review the footage of the man taking the bottle of wine and talking to the staff in order to purchase it. In addition, the hotel manager refuses to take responsibility for the fact that her staff was negligent in physically checking the closet for the jacket."
1939,1,"What a terrible disappointment and substandard hotel this is in every respect. I'm a Titanium Elite and spend 100 nights in Marriott branded hotels a year. This place is more like a Fairfield Inn- and I've stayed in better Fairfield Inns than this place. Paper thin walls. Heard the guest in the next room opening and closing their curtains. I wonder what they could hear? Understaffed at the check in. Arguments about the upgraded room I previously confirmed. TV with no pay channels like HBO. Impossible to get a constant temperature stream out of the shower. The breakfast buffet featured powdered eggs, greasy bacon and undercooked potatoes. The fitness center has Precor equipment at least 10 years old. I got notified my car would be brought around in 8 minutes. After 20 of waiting at the valet it finally showed up. Tone deaf management to complaints. A server responded to my dissatisfaction with a ""laundry list"" of his own/ basically telling me he hears this from everyone and that every staff member and manager hates the owners. My wife and I walked to the Marriott Union Square and Westin St. Francis and were greeted by enthusiastic team members pleased to show us the rooms and describe their services. That's for next time. When I asked if they were owned by the same people who owned the JW they emphatically responded : NO! That says it all. Spend your Marriott Money elsewhere . I've also had good experiences at the Marquis. This place isn't worth the time, energy or the money. Choose Wisely."
1940,3,"Stayed at the JW Marriott for one night.  The valet driver smoked in my vehicle.  The valet company is 3rd party and therefore the hotel is doing nothing to alleviate this issue.  I just called the hotel once again requesting they provide my email address to the valet manager since the gentleman didn't have the command of English to copy down my email address.  The manager, Jacob, at the JW requested I ""not call again regarding this issue"".  This was the first time that I requested my email address be provided to the valet company.  I stated ""Bud, I think you need to check yourself before you tell me not to call back again"" to which Jacob said ""you don't need to call me bud, I'm very qualified etc. etc...""So I guess if you stay at this hotel, expect your car to smell like a chimney and don't expect Jacob or anyone in management to do a thing about it.  I'm a Platinum something or other member at Marriott, but that obviously has no pull.  The one star is for the fact that they didn't charge me $60 parking for my car to be smoked in :)"
1941,1,"Hotel Staff and Loss Prevention are PREJUDICE and RACIST.  I've always used the outside hotel lobby for my lunch breaks. Simply to sit and enjoy my music. Today, a Loss Prevention personal approached me and told me that I could not sit there and sleep because I am not a guess of the hotel.  Just last week, there was a huge convention, me a few of my colleagues (all white) decided to relax in the lounge area,  NO ONE ever approached us and told us that we had to leave. It's 2018 and things like this are STILL occurring. He assumed because of the way I dressed/looked, there was no way I could be a guest of the Hotel. How would he have known?! He didn't even ask if I was he just assumed! POC , specifically African American, just know that if you look certain a way you will not be treated with respect at this hotel."
1942,3,"I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this hotel, not only for personal stays but for booking rooms and event spaces for clients and out-of-town team members. I decided to check in this weekend for my birthday and have not been impressed with the service. I expected to be wowed, but have been nothing but disappointed throughout my stay. From a rather cold check in process, to difficulty getting to my room with elevators packed to get to the rooftop bar (why is there a dedicated elevator the bar?), rude service staff. No late check out. room service food was terrible, etc. Also, no one answers the ""Yes"" customer service line, so you can't check on why your room service order has not arrived or anything else. It's also extremely loud, so you won't be getting much sleep."
1943,1,"I had really high expectations for this place as we don't have a lot of rooftop bars in SF! And you'd think that this place attracts good crowd, but I got my jacket stolen right near me yesterday in the rooftop bar. When I talked to the staff, they said that it was not their responsibility and followed their amazing treatment by taking us out of the bar. The staff member proceeded with giving me a card with no phone number in it and asked me to call him back the next day to check on my jacket. Excuse me? call who if I have no phone number to call? We didn't behave in any way that was inappropriate, we just inquired if they could turn on the light so that I can see where it is, they refused to turn it on. Also, since there are cameras everywhere, I asked if we could see the video footage of when my jacket got stolen, they refused to cooperate. It appears to me that this place doesn't care at all about their customers or retaining the few good people who go to this place. I am quite disappointed. I usually get an outstanding treatment when I go to other hotels, but Virgin hotel just doesn't seem to care at all. Don't expect that you get what you pay for there, that's all what I have to say!"
1944,3,"While the decor is kitschy and the staff is friendly, the hotel has certainly not worked out its kinks. After checking in, I was in the elevator to my room with someone delivering room service. He went into a diatribe about the restaurant being over-booked and the hotel making him work two jobs. Then, my bathroom door handle broke into two pieces. They also put me on the 11th floor, below the roof bar. They never explained there was a club or asked if I would prefer a room on a quieter floor. My walls are still shaking. It is 1:10am. I called at 12:20am and Shawn explained that by 1 it would be over but that he would call upstairs bc he could actually hear the music through the phone. I called again. And again. It's still happening. If you want to stay here, wait until they can train staff correctly and don't stay on the 11th floor. Sleepless in San Francisco ;("
1945,1,"Place is really beat up--not that clean--needs painting bad.I had a reaction to some allergy--probably someone had a dog in the room. For $900 a night pitiful room and experience. I explained to the hotel I was up all night- ? they really didn't care. We cancelled the balance of the reservation and left town,Do NOT waste your money--lots of attitude w/lousy rooms.Go ahead and try a Red Roof motel for the same experience."
1946,1,"I was looking forward to staying at Hotel Drisco while in SF on business. Unfortunately, my stay there was not positive.I stayed in room 302. This room faces a light well, the view being into windows of other rooms and an adjacent apartment building. There is no ventilation in this room and it is thus airless and stuffy. The only way to get air is to open the windows. In doing so, you are now subject to non-stop noise from other rooms, i.e. cell phones ringing/being answered at all hours, sexual relations, conversations, baby crying, toilets flushing, TV, etc. The roller shade on the window was non-functional with light coming into the room an issue all night. Air quality - around 4 a.m. fetid odors of burning food filled the room and were still present when I checked out at 9 a.m. All of this made for a miserable night and a less than refreshed sense of being for the work day ahead. I have read similar reviews on other forums such as trip advisor. It seems that the quality of your experience at this hotel depends on what room you get. It appears that if you can afford an upper floor, outward facing suite w/view the reviews are positive. For the unfortunates who are assigned what appears to be one of four rooms on each floor that faces inward to the light well it is an unpleasant stay. I contacted the hotel manager with this feedback and did not receive a response, hence my review here. Potential customers need to know that a ""deluxe queen"" room (what I had) was a miserable room to spend a night in. Would hate to have a less ""deluxe' room.Management needs to come clean on the reality of their rooms, i.e. rooms facing a light well, no attached bath, etc. in their online descriptions and when booking so that the customer can decide if these limitations are worth the price. Based on my experience,  I cannot recommend this hotel to others."
1947,3,"We checked in the night of New Year's eve and it was all bad.  The hallways smelled musty like a nursing home and the room we check into was room 109.  DO NOT STAY IN ROOM 109.  It is by the stairway and elevator, we heard everyone walking by and all of their conversations.  The walls are so paper thin that you could even hear the people at the front desk.  We didn't get an ounce of sleep even though we had drinks before coming home.  By the way where's the mini bar???!! Beautiful location but the room is definitely not worth the $260/ night!!!"
1948,2,"Worst hotel I've stayed at for business/work travel. I typically do not write reviews, unless I'm displeased with service. Tonight I was called and approached twice for a noise complaint. The 1st time I was called at 6:45PM that there was too much noise coming from my room. Let alone I am staying by myself and was speaking on the phone with my wife and daughter, because a family member passed away. Secondly, I went out to pick up food, came back at 8:30PM, and was immediately approached by 2 gentlemen at my door for a 2nd noise complaint. I opened my door wide and showed them there are no other individuals staying with me. No parties, nothing, and was accused of slamming my door and making too much noise. I'm here for work, nothing else. Based on our conversation, my side was not taken into consideration. I was told to be quite, stop the noise, stop slamming doors (never did once), otherwise I would be kicked out. My side was not taken into consideration, let alone I did nothing wrong. Thanks for not taking my side of the story into consideration and taking this as a one way conversation. I can't speak to those around me, but what if the noise came from another adjacent room? It sure wasn't coming from mine. Never staying at a Hyatt again just for a decent deal, ever again. Hyatt, you should approach situations hearing both side of the story. Just because one complains, doesn't mean it's the truth (especially during a Giants game, when several people are staying at your hotel)."
1949,3,"When I was looking for hotels via Expedia, I wanted to make sure that the hotel had free breakfast and free parking. I came across this hotel and was under the impression that the following would have been included and my total for the room (excluding tax and service fees) would have been $157/night. I even looked through the website and hotel confirmation email just to double check if these amenities were included, and they both said that they were. However, this was not the case. First of all, there was no onsite parking. We were told to park in a third party parking garage and pay $35/day for self service, and double that amount for valet. In terms of the breakfast, it is only free if you are a club member (which was not originally stated in the website or confirmation email). For everyone else, you are only given a $15 voucher to cover whatever you order for breakfast. My boyfriend and I decided to go ahead and get breakfast from the hotel anyways and just use the $15 voucher towards the buffet. When we found out that the breakfast buffet was $30+/person, we opted for the menu items instead. As soon as we were seated, we were offered coffee. So of course, we assumed the coffee was complimentary and we went ahead and ordered 2 cups. But boy was that a big mistake. We were given the menus after we had already drank our coffee, and to our surprise, a cup of plain, black coffee was $6/cup. At this point, we were already seated and finished our drinks, and we didn't want to be rude and leave. So we decided to just splurge on breakfast and give the food a chance, despite the price. When we thought our breakfast couldn't have been anymore disappointing, we received our food and found that 1 waffle came out to $20, and 2 eggs with about 4 small pieces of potatoes came out to $19. Overall we ended up spending $70+ more than what we were expecting on amenities we thought were already included. If I would've known there was no free parking or breakfast, I would not have booked this hotel to begin with. Don't get me wrong, the staff we encountered were super nice and I had no issues with the actual room. I just wish they were more clear on the pricing and included amenities prior to booking."
1950,3,"well, this might be a lengthy one. sorry guys :(I stayed at the Hyatt Regency last week and have been to many hotels in my day but for some reason this one just doesn't sit right with me. I booked my room on bookings.com and it said $157 a night- and let me tell you, that was the deal I was looking for. Furthermore, after MANY fees the total said it would come out to around 615$ total for 3 nights. I was pretty shocked but at this point when I realized the price, i had already put down the $250 hold. But, whatever.. right? On the site it had said there was breakfast, and what looked to be a ""luxury"" room - the Cali King Deluxe. When I arrived, they said that there was going to be at least a $100 hold as well per night, that we would probably get back. The website did not mention this. My friend runs his card and it turns out that they released the $250 hold from my card and straight up charged him over $900. My friend was lucky that he had enough money to cover- but you would think someone would have mentioned this beforehand. Then, we get to the room. Windows don't open & no fan for the bathroom. It was also pretty small. We were just trying to light of the situation at this point. BUT THEN, the next day rolls around and we're thinking we're about to get some hotel- included breakfast. Well friends, it doesn't work that way here. We ask front desk about breakfast and he says he's unaware of where it's located. We walk around in the very nice looking lobby & find it in the restaurant area. We're thinking ""yessss at last"" after walking around for like 15 minutes not knowing where we're going, lol. We walk in, grab one plate each and load it. We sit down and a waiter comes up to us and asks if we would like anything to drink and says that it's free. We both get water and then my guy friend, leaves to go to the bathroom shortly after. The second he leaves a new waiter comes by and asks to see my room key. I say that my friend has it. He says ""well, it needs to a black room key"" WITHOUT EVEN SEEING IT and then plops a bill in front of me and says ""if you have a problem, talk to the front desk"" I open it & guess how much it is. $72!!! Turns out that the only people who get breakfast are what seem to be ""elites"". The Hyatt Regency website didn't say that either. What a shock.  I get up frantically to find my friend to tell him (I didn't bring my phone downstairs w me) and since I didn't know where the bathroom was I was walking around and then when I got even remotely close to the elevator area (the layout is weird and there's a bunch of random business rooms near there so I assumed the bathroom would be there too) I got CHASED DOWN by 3 waiters AND the guy at the front desk. It was embarrassing because there was people everywhere  I didn't even know how to react and one of the waiters has the bill in hand from our table and yells ""YOU NEED TO PAY FOR THIS!!"" -- honestly, it was kind of traumatic. Now looking back, I realize that everyone was really just watching us the whole time and waiting for us to get some food just so they could charge us for it. And the craziest thing to me is where did they think I was gonna go??? This is where I was staying for the next 2 days. I really thought this hotel was going to impress me but it really just wanted every penny I had with nothing but basic accommodation in return. Sad times."
1951,3,"Having 10+ years of event and operations management, I believe Hyatt fell short on the hospitality category.My younger brother has been attending a conference/job fair at the Hyatt Regency, visiting from New York. Waiting for him to conclude his event, I went to the bathroom, then walking towards the bar, I was stopped by a staff and 2 other folks what I imagine security, asking what I'm doing here since I am not dressed in a suit and without a badge.I guess using the bathroom and walking to the bar is not allowed at Hyatt Regency. I hope the event manager and security enjoyed feeling empowered for no reason other than their personal satisfaction of shaming me around others. The bar staff was by far more amiable and professional than your event and security folks.To Hyatt: if you want to dispute my review, check out your security video on the 2nd (bar) floor between 5:30PM to 7PM on Feb 9th, 2019.Update on Feb 20, 2019 - Response to Tiffany T.:There is this hip, old thing everyone around the world is into called ""having personnel standing at every entry/exit point for events"". Might want to look into it in your old event management 101 manual. Even some sort of signage would work just fine too. Best of luck to you and all."
1952,3,"First off, The Hotel and the grounds are beautiful, but Management needs work! Today when I got my credit card statement I noticed that there was unknown charges on my credit card from Hotel Kabuki (I stayed there in March) So I called thinking that there must have been a mistake, but I was told that I had a second room reserved and that is what the charges are for. After telling the accountant that I only reserved one room and that I don't know why I was being charged for 2 rooms, she had me talk to management. That is where I was told that they could do nothing for me, that I shouldn't of booked 2 rooms (I never booked 2 rooms.) Worst Experience Ever!"
1953,1,"Beware--they try to charge you a mandatory hotel fee of $30/day that is not included in the room reservation pricing, and the info is buried in the taxes section of the pricing details. They don't seek consent--they just add it to your room charges. This is not a tax mandated by the city or state; it is just the hotel trying to collect more money from you than they originally promised, for normal hotel services. The hotel itself is just average, and they should be fully transparent in their pricing. This seems incredibly dishonest."
1954,3,"2.5 stars. The OPM has great potential. It really does. But it's not quite capitalizing upon it, and I hope that changes.Pros: It's right across from the zoo and right by the beach. The drive to Golden Gate (and Napa/Sonoma!) is fast and easy. The Muni stop is right across the street so public transportation is a breeze. The bright colors of the exterior are charming, and the staff is generally very pleasant. The landscaping in the courtyard is pretty (love that big, old tree!), and there is sufficient parking for guests. The room rates were reasonable. We had a fridge so we could make breakfast at home and keep our costs down a little on vacation.Cons: The suites with two queen beds aren't really big enough for two queen beds. The flower arrangements on the walls made me want to throw things. The bedding is not high quality (which is to be expected, for a motel), but it's also just not attractive. The beds were soft, which hurt my back. The Muni stop means constant background noise for street-facing rooms. They leave the windows open all the time, even when residents close the windows, which felt unsafe to me given the street-level location and number of pedestrians outside -- I would've been upset if anything had gone missing. The bathroom is TINY, and it is impossible to shave your legs in the shower. The kitchen could use some editing to maximize the space, too, because it's tight in there. The pots and pans are terrible.Advice to OPM: Embrace your small size! There are creative storage options that could really maximize your space while retaining its charm. Update your bedspreads with something bright, and lose the wall flower arrangements. Look into some inexpensive wall art that doesn't eat into the room space instead! Does every room need a dresser if the rooms are as small as they are? Swap out the queen bed in the main room for a futon or pull-out couch so there is some walking space when no one is sleeping. Some minor cosmetic changes that don't affect the structure of your motel could really make it shine and bring in more business!"
1955,1,"I contacted Asen due to paint falling off both the body and trim of my house that he painted 3 years ago.  In part, his response was ""I have photos of your house before and it was in very poor condition with many years past due on painting.  I can't fix many years problems with a magic wand.""So buyer beware.  Unless  your house does not need prep, do not hire this company.Very disappointing and extra money to be spent to remedy the sub-standard work."
1956,2,"Arg.  I'm sorry to have to update my review here.  After having such a good experience before from Universe, I asked them to come back and do more painting.  They did a bid but after trying 3x over 4 weeks to actually get the bid from them, they just never respond.  I talk to Asen multiple times, he promises it will come that day, and never does.  So frustrating.  I'm not calling a 4th time."
1957,2,"I really, really regret hiring Universe to paint the exterior of my house. Their work was poor quality - painting over dry rot, not filling in cracks, not cleaning, and generally not doing thorough prep work. This caused the paint to bubble up. They came back to fix some of the problems. I'm sure they ended up losing money on the project. I certainly lost a lot of money by having to stay home multiple times to be here while they redid their work. In the end I still have paint bubbling up all over my brand new paint job.UNIVERSE, do not contact me again."
1958,1,"Stay away from this flaky business. Not only they acted unprofessionally, but they also gave away their poor quality of service by refusing to work with me when I asked about their warranty. Tells something about the business. Originally I wanted to avoid negative reviews as they usually don't bring much value, but then I thought about all the potential clients who will avoid wasting time with CertaPro and rather deal with someone who deserves their business. I can provide all the email communication if needed to prove the case. Thank you."
1959,2,"We had certa pro paint our entire home. They made such a mess it looked like they painted with a broom. They painted all the trim with FLAT paint, left areas undone. We called a professional company to repair the work. We wouldn't trust them to even fix it. I wouldn't let Certa Pro paint my nails!"
1960,3,"Scheduled an appointment with Jessica to have George and his team come out for an estimate.  She called back the day of the estimate to say ""their wires must have gotten crossed and they booked another appointment a half our before mine and he'll be late.""  Not only was she super sassy about providing the information, she was pretty insincere about resolving the matter.   I'm sure they would do a great job, but maybe they don't need the business with a receptionist like that."
1961,3,I sent 2 emails and left 2 voicemail messages.  I got one email back asking more specifics about the job.  I replied that is was simple - only 2 walls that needed wallpaper removed.  Radio silence since then.  Bummer because this was a fairly easy job that could have lead to a lot more work.
1962,3,"I hired Marcio's painting company for a complete painting of my business. It was agreed that every fixture in the facility would be taped or removed and reinstalled. I paid $6900 for the labor and materials, so I expected professional work.After they finished the job every fixture in the facility had paint on it and I have uploaded several pictures showing the unprofessional work they did. The window frames also have paint which looks terrible and has ruined the steel window seals likely causing thousands of dollars in damage. We agreed that they would tape everything off or remove fixtures. Also his team did not clean up the tons of dust left from the sanding of the walls. Half of my equipment, desks and business were not covered and had a lot of dust which was very hard to clean. I have paid hundreds of dollars to clean and there is thousands of dollars in damage to my window seals. In addition, my employees and I have been working tirelessly and gone through a whole bottle of Goof Off removing paint over the last 1.5 months cleaning the countless mistakes. Also one of the painters used my vacuum to clean up the fine dust ruined it and I had to buy a new vacuum. After a big patch of paint peeled off I discover they did not wipe the walls after sanding so there is fine dust under the paint--now every wall is delicate and the slightest bump is causing paint to peak off around the facility. For 8 weeks I have sent photos, called and text explaining the mistakes and if they could come by to clean off the paint on the fixtures, etc. Finally, two workers scheduled with me--showed up an hour late. They attempted to clean paint off of at least the countless fixtures, pipes, etc. They did not have enough time to even complete the touch ups. I emailed a week ago expressing my concerns and that I've spent hundreds of dollars cleaning up after the mess they left and they have chosen to not respond.This is after my employees and I had been cleaning the paint spots for 1.5 months. This has caused me a lot of wasted time and money. I had to buy a new vacuum and hire another painter to come in to fix where the paint peeled off. And I am left with thousands of dollars in damage to the window seals facility wide."
1963,3,"Made an appointment for an estimate visit. Marcio was a no show, and didn't call to inform me. I called him after waiting for 30 minutes, left a message and never heard back from him..."
1964,2,These guys came out for an estimate it's been two weeks with no estimate from them.  Even after messaging them they still haven't contacted me.  Time to find someone that really wants to complete the job.  I need my whole house painted inside and out.  Guess they are too busy to want the job!
1965,1,"I hired Tom and Maria to paint the interior of my home. They bid and we agreed to a contracted price *in writing*. Three days into the job, Tom cited ""hidden"" issues and said they would need to charge me an extra 75%. I told him this seemed beyond excessive and asked for a breakdown of where the extra cost was coming from. Rather than do this, he instructed his crew to stop working. He and sister Maria came to my house and announced they were abandoning the job. I asked if they were interested in discussing a way to move forward and they said no. I warned them they were breaking the law by abandoning a job and that, moreover, this was a really crappy thing to do as we were heading into the holidays. In case you don't know this, for a licensed contractor to abandon a job is not only illegal, but highly unethical. To try and sneakily charge for materials when the contract included materials is likewise unethical (and stupid).They've left the house in a terrible state and me in a terrible jam (see pictures). They needlessly scraped 90% of the paint off the master bathroom, which now requires the whole room to be re-floated. They left uneven, poorly applied plaster all over the house. We moved everything out of the house for them and now cannot move things back in as the house in an unliveable state. They splattered white paint on our brown stucco. I would highly advise staying away from this company. I can't state this strongly enough. For a licensed company to be so unethical and blatantly violate the law just because it suited them should be a dire warning. I have filed a complaint with the CSLB (state licensing board), BBB, and their bond company. Before you hire them, check the CSLB as they will soon have a violation for job abandonment. Feel free to contact me for information on the case. In all the work I've had done on what is a large remodel, this was the most blatantly, unabashedly unprofessional thing I've experienced. I have the written and pictorial evidence to prove it."
1966,1,"Terrible experience. We agreed on price for entire exterior house painting. They came and power washed the house, then Maria came and said for them to complete the job we'd have to pay $3000 above the accepted price, 40% higher then we were quoted. Complete bait and switch. They didn't cover windows when power washing so water and debris entered out house and ruined 4 of our window blinds. Avoid at all costs. Completely unprofessional."
1967,2,"I called to get an estimate on a painting project I needed done.  I spoke to Oleg & made an appointment with him to come out to discuss.   Oleg came out on time & we discussed my project. He advised me that we would email the estimate to me if I texted that information to him.  I did.  He texted me about 1.5 weeks later to tell me he was working on my estimate, but wanted to know if I provided parking!  I told him that he could park in front of my garage, but he would have to move when tenants needed to access the garage.That was almost 4 weeks ago.  Never got an estimate.I got someone else to do my project."
1968,3,"OK here's the deal: The paint job in the end was fine. The process and deal was not ""best."" Oleg first asked for $1,000 to paint one large room, (actually two small attached parlors, in my Nob Hill building. I asked for $700 bid noting it was a one day job. He said it could not be done for less than with $800 and could NOT be done in one day. I just moved back into my apt after a year long hiatus from a building fire. I really needed to get ""home."" So I said yes. Oleg came looked at the job, said no, needs to coats, will be ANOTHER $800! Please. I said one coat off white on the very recently painted bright white walls --absolutely NO prep needed! The very sweet Latino man who did the work was a very good painter. But I can tell you he was instructed to do the slowest tape job, paint job ever. Again, it looks fine now, but ""Besdeal?!"" Not even close. Postscript: We all have perspectives, I suppose. Oleg called day of job (AFTER seeing it) and said he could do it for $750 following Wednesday. Guess he got a better offer last minute. And no, there was NO MENTION of $300 for a second coat of paint. Which I did not want. I told him I wanted one coat and to show up at the job as specified. WHATEVER... you decide."
1969,1,"IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH !Their phone number never gets answered, even during business hours. The voicemail says to leave a message, but never gives you that option, ending the call before any beep. Trying back on repeated days doesn't change that protocol.They could be good painters, but if you can't reach them they're worthless. Don't waste your time."
1970,1,"I made an appointment with Peter at Modamas to look at my house for a painting estimate. After hurrying across the city to arrive on time, I waited and waited -  he didn't show up and didn't call  -  when I finally called  him Peter nonchalantly told me that he had completely forgot about the appointment.  Seems like a VERY FLAKY and insincere way to do business.Maybe the painters they use are nice and good (from all the positive reviews), but my experience with Modamas was certainly not positive.Definitely would not recommend!"
1971,1,"Modamas regularly leaves business cards next to our apt. building mailboxes, so I thought that I'd give them a call for a quote. I explained that it was an 800 sq. ft. interior space and before I could explain what the job entailed, I was told that ""it was a little too small for us."" He referred me to Red Hill Painting and hung up. Business must be good for them now, so don't waste your time calling like I did if you have a similar size space. The one star is for the reference."
1972,1,"This company is a disgrace to the painting industry. Very disappointed to where we have become in customer service. I called this place that I found in yelp as I manage multiple towers in the city of San Francisco to ask if they can paint an outdoor for us. The guy who answered the phone was rude and needs to learn some manners! YES, I have at the moment one day I need to pain, he was very rude and tried to insult me because I wanted to paint one door only. Sadly he is so narrow minded even though I told him I manage multiple high rises in the city. If u have a brain to use u will know that yes today I have one door, but in some point in the near future I will have over 150 door and a tower to be painted...!!!For sure I will NOT call you or let any manager in my office call you. It's pathetic and sad to have these companies around."
1973,1,"Left numerous messages several days in between hoping to get a call back for a quote on some work that I was hoping they could help me with regarding lead paint. I NEVER got a call back from anyone. Very unprofessional.  If they felt that the possible job was not worth their time, the least they could have done is call back  to let me know they wouldn't be able to help.  It doesn't take that long to call someone back.   Just don't waste your time with this company."
1974,3,"The work of Rhapsody Painting is actually not too bad (although not as good as they try to convince you it is).  But once you've used them, you MUST go with any bid they give you after that.  If you don't they'll just flat-out refuse to ever work for you again."
1975,3,"Significant amounts of water are pooling on my flat Eichler garage roof after heavy rain. After Armstrong re-roofed, they did not check the gradient of the drainage and their poor workmanship has not become evident until heavy rains in December.I have now called ""Dorina"" and left voicemails 4 times with no response."
1976,3,"I priced out a foam roof among several other local options.  The price of Armstrong was in fact more than competitors, but I decided to go with them based on what my neighbor said.  I have a low slope, or flat roof so foam is usually a good option.  Signed a contract because the guy who came out, Wayne seemed to be very knowledgeable and confident.  The price was about $22,000 for a tear off 1100 sq foot of single story flat roof.  Anyway I signed a contract which included $100/hr of dryrot clause.  A month out I get a call from Armstrong they want to walk the job.  Next thing I know they say they can't do the dry rot and give me the contact info to some random dude I think is a cousin of one of the guys to do the dry rot repair.  They say they don't do structural repairs.  I tried  calling but the voicemail is in Spanish and I could never get through.  I can pretty much guarantee he was an uninsured, unlicensed day laborer.  It became too late in the season and I didn't get my roof done on time.  I could have sued because we had a contract in place and they backed out.  In the mean time I signed up with another company and the dry rot ended up being about 5 grand, not a big deal.  I'm not sure why they couldn't do it, every contractor I talked to is surprised because roof framing is a very basic capability for a roofing company to have on their team.  Very disappointed."
1977,3,"I can't even put one star out he quoted us $22,700 to paint our house with a 10 year warranty. My house is 2200 ft.² two story.I had several other painting companies come out and all the bids were under $6000. He said he would call me back the following week after I had received all my bids never heard from this person ever again thanks George for your ridiculous bid. I can get my house painted four times within a 10 year. Your paint isn't that good!"
1978,1,"Worst experience I've had recently regarding home repair.  We have an Eichler home in San Mateo that needed repairs.  I called and left many messages with Anderson since we hear them on the radio all the time, figured they were the best.  I finally spoke to someone in a call center who said they would send out an estimator.  The estimator showed up with NO LADDER and asked to borrow ours.  He climbed to the top of the ladder and surveyed the roof but NEVER ACTUALLY GOT ON THE ROOF!  He climbed down and gave us a $25000 estimate and told us they could do it next spring.  From his vantage point, there's no way he could see the other part of the roof that was heavily damaged nor could he see the top of the second floor addition so I knew darn well that quote was going to double when the workers actually made it on the roof.  He pressured us to sign an contract right away and we declined as I was going to shop around.  If this is indicative of their actual work, I am glad we chose another company, American Foam Experts who properly appraised our roof in one day and we had a new roof complete and done within a month.  I would not recommend Anderson at all and you'd be wise to do a LOT of research before you choose a roofer."
1979,2,"I have bought quite a few items from Couture and had been happy up to last Friday when I was expected to receive a wallet to complement my bag for my birthday dinner. Problem: The item was shipped via United States Postal Service when I was told it would have been shipped via FedEx. The package never arrived. It put a huge damper on my entire day because I stayed home to wait for the item, and was anxious to use it on my birthday. I eventually canceled my dinner because I was very disappointed. What's more, USPS lied about coming to my house and leaving a slip. What they didn't realize is that I have two cameras facing the front of my home. And no one ever came. Thus, there wasn't any slip. My daughter has been behind me to shop at another competitor, so that's my next move."
1980,3,"LV bag smelled of water damage. I was not told about the oder when I spoke to attendant over the phone. Not fair! Not good! Also, lock had no key. What is up with that? This could have been disclosed during phone conversation."
1981,3,The actual website is ok however the purse I purchased was not great. I understand that I am buying a used product but I was still disappointed. Not only did the purse look very worn inside it smelled of smoke. $800.00 down the drain. Honestly I probably would not purchase anything off this website again but I also will never take the chance on buying a used purse again either. At least my sister is getting a Chanel purse out of this deal. She smokes so will never know the difference. I feel bad to review the website bad but I think it should be noted that the purse stinks.
1982,3,"The young ladies that work in the showroom are very stand offish they need to be a little bit more welcoming that would make for an overall better experience . I do love Catherine, I love the selection that she has in her boutique. I love the fact that you can find anything from a pair of Tiffany & Co earrings to a fashionable Louis Vuitton bag or a pair of Gucci heels and a keychain for your Prada bag it's just very convenient to have everything right in one store."
1983,3,"Pros: The items that I have purchased so far are indeed authentic, and comes safely and conveniently packaged. And so far, customer service has been attentive and responsive.Cons: The company needs to do a better job of ensuring that orders paid for are actually shipped, and not sold to someone else after confirming a customer's purchase. Also, they need to be more careful and vigilant about inspection of items before listing them, since I just had to return a belt that was obviously sold to the company damaged and disguised in a way to hide that fact. Then, sold to me as advertised in good condition, but luckily upon inspection before breaking the Couture seal, I noticed it was cut and poorly hand-sewn in an attempt to cover it up."
1984,1,"This is the worst company EVER! I have never dealt with such a poorly run company. All they did was over charge and take my money. I don't even have an order number just an invoice number through PayPal. I tried to contact several times to no avail. I tried to purchased Miniature Donkey's they come in packages of 10. It states Free Shipping and if you buy 2-4 the cost is 4.90. I purchased 2 packages and they charged me #18.54. You do the math they over charged me 8.74 and I have never heard from them. No way to track my package. They are extremely unprofessional and absolutely no Customer Service. I am trying to get my $$$$ back through pay-pal. Wish me luck!

1987,3,Was shipped the wrong item. Ordered a XBOX One controller shell in leopard print for my girlfriend. Instead received a XBOX 360 shell in leopard print and was informed after sending them an email with photos that they couldn't do anything as it would cost me more to ship the item back than it cost to order the controller. So I was pretty much screwed.
1988,3,I ordered 30 windup clockwork caterpillars cost £34.75 - shipping free and in small print “may have to pay import duties if large order but we will let you know” - no contact about this from Suntekstore but then I had to pay £11.56 to get the parcel from the PO - the extra charge was not for Import duty but was a Royal Mail International handling fee - which if usually shipped by Royal mail must happen every time! Suntekstore said I would need to return the item to China for a refund or could accept a £5 refund - which I did as I needed the caterpillars.I am guessing this happens all the time!!!!!
1989,3,"The return policy sounds great, return for any reason. The bracelet I ordered was very nice but my husband just didn’t like it.I went to process a return, there is no link to process & return or print a return label. Instead you print a sheet to fill out and ship at your own expense and they say it will be a month. There is no communication letting you know that the item has been received & your return is being processed. I attempted to call to check on the refund status but I can’t get a live person on the phone. After multiple attempts I decided to email, still no response. The customer service is non-existent and making me hesitant to order an item my husband does like. I’ve returned/exchanged other designer jewelry with a much better customer experience from DY & other companies."
1990,2,"Unfortunately, I didn't take a picture of before and after...Two days after receiving/wearing the bracelet, the kevlar cord came loose from the larger clasp. No, it did not catch on anything, nor did I pull it, it literally just slipped off my wrist as I was conversing with my wife.I wasn't angry, more like embarrassed after I had shown it off to friends and family and realized how much I paid for something of this poor quality.I'm wearing it again, with the help of Krazy Glue, but I will unlikely make this mistake again."
1991,3,I purchased a chain and pendant for my boyfriend for his birthday it was extremely small and was what we expected. I returned the purchase and I had to pay to ship it back. The item was shipped and received by William Henry on 02-19-18. Today is 03-02-18 and I'm still waiting to be credited my 313.00 dollars... not a great experience at all..
1992,3,The bracelet doesn't look like what was advertised. Smaller than expected and looks like something I could have purchased on Alibabu or some other supply chain item. Honestly it wasn't worth what I paid for it. Comparably I could have selected something off of Etsy Handcraft for half the price and more originality. The artist knives are wonderful but the bracelet was way below standard.
1993,3,"Had to pay double tax since you have declared the true value of the bracelet in the receipt or airway bill. When the Customs here in Manila, Philippines sees that its a huge amount, they take interest and charge me a huge tax payment for them to release the item. I had to pay $400 more for our customs here to release the package. I paid over $100 for that International UPS shipment, so why do I have to pay a ridiculous $400 more for the customs here to release my shipment. You guys gotta figure out a way to save your international customers money. Why not try other couriers such as DHL? My transaction was rediculously expensive."

And only arrived on January 17th and wrong product delivery !After claiming such a failure, which is inadmissible, because much greater care had to be taken with the product than sent to other countries and continents, they came to propose that we seek the most economical way to return it and that they would later repay us.But who guarantees me that I would receive ???I have had enough negative experiences with this type of returns, to be doubting about this.What I know, is that my son wanted to surprise me and my kind of taste, and spent his savings money and now I have something here, not to mention something worse, that I will not use.PART 2DELIVER ANOTHER WATCH WRONG !!!To correct the first error, it goes wrong AGAIN ! ????Miss a second time, is something that does not deserve more comments to your service !I think you guys should devote yourself to planting potatoes. Maybe they did better service !"

I was about the reccomend my friends and family about this company but I guess I won't now...

At least three times in my communication I have asked why they haven’t addressed this yet they continue to ignore. Not a good experience and would not recommend... disappointed.Drafted this to post a week ago in the hope that they would reply. Now December 23rd, no watches and short of nearly £400.Dispicable!"

1998,1,"My husband ordered a watch on December the 12th, it was supposed to arrive within 10 days, for my birthday which is on December 28th. The package was sent via DHL - from California to Mexico - and for some reason, while he was tracking it, it appeared in Germany. He tried to contact costumer service and they went on vacation, so they won't answer his emails... In the 21th Century, the era of technology, where you can read and email and answer it in seconds, no matter where you are!!!Obviously, the day of my birthday he had to tell me what had happened and bought something else. Today, he got and email updating the status of the package but now it says that's not on the DHL service anymore, rather now on the Mexican Postal Service, which makes no sense. We have ordered a lot of things from many countries via DHL, and this has never happened before!The worst is that they won't answer and won't care about costumer service like a serious company should. WE WANT A REFUND!UPDATE January 2.So, they finally wrote back, and now they are telling us that they can only give us a refund if we turn down the package once it gets to our home. But here's the problem: whomever is in charge of costumer service says the the package is in our local post office and gave us a tracking number. But it doesn't exist, we made a phone call to Correos de México and they told us that they haven't recieved anything. So we checked the tracking number from DHL again, and guess what? The watch is still in Frankfurt, Germany (I don't even know what it is doing in Europe, since the ""company"" is American and we live in Mexico, to begin with). How can this company even exist? What a lack of professionalism. A total scam! Wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1999,1,"They will outright steal your clothes. I've sent in a few boxes and there's 1/3 of clothes that just magically ""disappear."" I keep a manual list, as well as photos, of all the clothes I send in. The workers there just take whichever items they like. Most of the ""missing"" clothes tended to be the new clothes, with tags on them.Then, the stuff they don't steal, about half of it gets rejected, even though they are good quality, like new or very good items. They also on purpose list them incorrectly. Too many are mislabeled to be an accident. Many are brand NEW WITH TAGS, and it's listed as USED. You can't miss the tag. Even the photos they took showed the tags.Even if they don't steal your clothes, or manage to not mislabel, they sell your clothes for next to nothing. And by next to nothing I mean literally NOTHING. I've had several items that sold where I received ZERO dollars. And the ones where I do receive money, the payout is pathetic. 30c and 75 for some items. They were completely unworn sweaters. I had a very nice sequin dress that was brand new with tags that I received a whopping $1.12 for. This place is a complete SCAM. They outright steal your clothes and pay you next to nothing for an ENTIRE BOX of clothes.

2000,1,"Worst place to sell anything. They used to be amazing but decided to apply new rules to items I sent in before the changes. There are other complaints. Do more research and you'll see how bad they are. I am now losing money on items they hold hostage for a fee to send back, even though I sent them in before the changes in terms and conditions. That's breach of contract. Don't send anything to them. They will not impressed you. I hope I save at least some people from making that mistake."

2002,1,"Note that most bad reviews are from SELLERS. That's for a reason, do not sell on SWAP.com.Like others had reported I was extra careful to review all items I sent out. They rejected 72%. Because my family is from France we got for my daughter super cute clothing from various popular brands. No stains, all in perfect condition. On top of that they have such high fees that you only get a few dollars back. This is a total waste of time.I would love this company to be audited to see where all the clothing supposedly ""recycled"" goes. I am totally convinced that it is resold to 3rd parties that sell for much more than what swap.com sells for. I will never recommend this site. It definitely lacks transparency."
2003,1,"I previously wrote a positive review about Swap.com, but now I can't recommend this company as a great place to shop for second hand clothes. My reasoning for changing my review is that I recently ordered clothes that were supposed to be ""New with Tags"" or ""Like New."" Well, to my astonishment when they arrived they were new, but what made me just say no more Swap.com was the dog or cat fur all over the clothes I had purchased! Seriously! Do the employees there just not care that they are selling people clothes that looked like ""Felix the Cat"" had rolled all over them? I understand these are used clothes or clothes that have been sitting in some lady's closet, but quality control should be in place at Swap.com. No way would I feel comfortable giving people clothes with my pet's fur balls on them and neither should this company. It is absolutely a lack of good morals to sell customers items labeled new, when in fact, they are just clothes that need to be disposed of and recycled. Of course, somebody may say, ""Why not just wash them, they are from a used clothing shop."" My remark back would be, ""That is beyond reasonable, as I paid money for the clothes and expect them to be in ""New Condition"" and without Lucky's undercoat pinned into them!""So, anybody who is interested in second hand clothes and loves the idea of Swap.com needs to look elsewhere and just go in person to the thrift stores and consignment shops. At least, you know what you are purchasing, as you can see it and not rely on some employee in a warehouse to label items correctly. My lesson was learned and I feel it necessary to pass on this information to other people. Also, the clothes are priced too high without coupon codes and you can buy new clothes at stores for cheaper, especially during sales and with store coupons. It's a bit ridiculous to sell used clothes for the same price as department stores. Another con is the fact that they don't give you a return label to return clothes or a bag to send them back in, which can cause issues for some customers, who Swap.com expects to just print out a label. Easy peasy, huh? Most legitimate companies provide, at least, the return labels. The idea behind the company is awesome, but the people who work there are less than admirable. The 1 star rating reflects everything posted above."
2004,3,"I made an order through lashowroom.com about 3 months ago. 2 days later I received an email stating that my order was canceled because a larger account purchased all of their bow ties and suspender sets. I felt less important and not valued as a new customer. I followed up about a month or so later and asked when they were going to receive more stock, but I never received a reply back.I do hope to do business with Selini eventually as I do want to still make a purchase."
2005,1,"Selini is a very dishonest business!I recently ordered adult winter masks online from them, they sent me kids size masks and they refused to take them back.If you order from Selini, there is 90% chance that you going to get the wrong thing. The pictures on their website don't exactly match their products!!!"
2006,3,"Ordered goods in Vegas. The stuff we really wanted, gas not shipped. Only the extra we really didn't need. Looks like we are screwed. Tony Strickland, Strickland enterprises, Gettysburg, pa."
2007,3,There was a lot of confusion of payment. I paid through a main site but they kept sending messages that it needed to be paid through them. The shipping was very expensive and slow. Product was OK for money.
2008,3,"I called before placing my order to check if something was truly in stock and the gentleman told me yes. I needed some items before the weekend so I asked if I place the order in the next 15 or 20 minutes if it would ship that day. It did not it did not ship for three days. Furthermore, I never received the item that he said he was going to add to the order. Poor customer service."
2009,1,"Honestly I can get a better fitting suit off the rack and I don't have a standard body shape. The system that they use is not a one that seems like it will lead to success. The first suit I received fit very poorly (was too tight in some places and way to big in others) and the second was even worse. Too tight all around, (and you can't fix that) and the pants had somehow become highwaters. Over all I would not recommend this site to others and I would suggest that they change their business model. For now I am out some money with nothing to show for it."
2010,1,"The customer service is good, but how does this help if both fabric and fit are disastrous even after several attempts? Fabric of low quality - still with wrinkles after ironing. Tailoring sub-par - after the third time they sent me a new shirt because the previous ones did not fit me well, it still looked like an ill-fitting shirt. I gave up on them. I have better things to do than taking pictures of ill-fitting shirts only to receive a still ill-fitting shirt again afterwards ... Would recommend a normal store or a proper tailor. Both have definitely better shirts."
2011,3,"They sent to Brazil, but when arrived, the invoice had a different price, so, Brazilian Government charge 849 dolares of tax by a shirt of 84,9 dolares price. I didn’t have any help or answer from Tailor Store, neither had my refund for the price that I had paid. Terrible service of shipping to Brazil. At least they should advise regularly about the cost of shipping including tax and specially they should fix this situation as soon as possible, to avoid that their clients have so many problems because a single piece of Shirt. Terrible experience. I am still waiting my money back!

2012,1,"ordered a three piece suit. The trousers were too long, the jacket hung like a sack and the the waistcoat was similarly too large. The sleeves were puckered at the top and the lapels were unpressed.The suit arrived completely crushed but even after pressing was unwearable.Total waste of money."
2013,3,"The first shirt I ordered didn't fit at all. I got another one for free and customer support seemed helpful. The second one fit better but it still wasn't great. I ordered another one to try to get the fit right. It fit better than the first two, but the fit was weird around the shoulders. When I contacted customer support about this they weren't very helpfull. It seems like customer support is only good for standard issues.I've now spent about a hundred euros on two shirts and a bunch of fabric samples and I have three shirts I never wear. Meanwhile a shirt I got on sale for 7 euros at a local store looks much better and fits like a glove. I won't be spending more of my money in the hope of getting the fit right in the future.For anyone who does feel like taking the plunge: I think customer support would have been more helpful if I complained after getting the second shirt. It seems like their standard way of doing things is if your first shirt doesn't fit, they change your sizes for you and you get another one for free. I think this keeps going until the fit is acceptable. Because I didn't want to be impolite and complain again when the second shirt arrived, I ordered the third one myself and their system didn't apply to me anymore."
2014,3,"Bought an outfit from this website for the first time and even paid for express shipping. Today, way past due date when I was supposed to have collected the item by now, its still not here. I checked my account and all it said was that my deludelivery status is ""unfulfilled"". Whatever that means. They never even clarified what it means and how we should follow through to help them fix the issue. Im willing to cooperate if they reach out, but nope. Its like no one give a damn.Customer service there is a joke no one responded to my enquiry which Ive sent multiples to. They leave me hanging for a few days now. With a hole in my bank account and no item to prove for my purchase.What I paid for aint cheap. At all. Plus delivery cost. I feel cheated and at lost for what to do."
2015,2,I ordered 2 dresses that were alike except for different colors with black accents. One for me and one for my mother in law. When I got them they were all black with the different colors on a very small part of the sleeves. They say satisfaction guaranteed and I even asked over the phone because of a previous order they had made me think was my fault that if I got something I didn't order would they take it back and pay shipping and they assured me they would. I sure enough this happened but after saying they would give me a refund if I paid the shipping to CA which is the cost of one of the dresses I sent an email showing how it was their fault they stopped responding and took the dresses off of the site so when I called about my return slip they had a new excuse saying I chose all black which is completely not true and I even have the proof of that. The choices were white and black the accent colors which I chose and the title of the dresses are the colors I wanted with black or white as accent choices not the entire dress. I have filed a refund from my bank and with the BBB. i believe this company does these things on a regular basis which is sad because muslim women need a place to buy clothes and they are taking advantage of us. I am almost sure these reviews are fake because this was my second order and both had shady dealings but this one took the cake. 
2016,2,"I sent them a PM, email, online chat, anything I can find after I made an order with express shipping and then I cannot log into my account, my email no longer exists. It has been a few days and no one at all even bothered to reply and help. Delivery is supposed to 5-8 Nov and it's now 6 Nov and I cannot even check if the order has been shipped out, I've not receive any emails from you as well about shipping. This is extremely stressful and I truly regret ordering from them."
2017,3,"Their range is good, sizing good, prices good. It took 23 days before they have finally told me my order has been dispatched and, following an email which said it would be sent express shipping, is now going to take a further 10 to 16 days to reach me in the UK. Their International Service is absolutely diabolical. I recall having this problem before and they sent skirt in totally wrong size!!!! I was so angry, I burned it!!!! I very much doubt if I will use them again, neither will my friends!!!!"
2018,1,"Company is not clear about the packing/shipping timing which can be well above full 6 weeks. I have not received the ordered goods yet (after 5 weeks) but I am already worried this is a scam as I cannot login into my account any more!!! I might have been be stripped off for 200,- USD, in a ""better"" case for some trash quality rags."
2019,2,"I was a Stitch Fix customer for over a year and was very happy with the quality and price of most items. I reluctantly canceled my subscription because of the perversity of their pricing--it actually costs significantly more to return an item you don't want than to keep it. They give a ""keep everything"" discount which exceeds the price of several of the individual items. Return it, you lose the discount and they charge more overall than if you had kept it. I suppose I could just donate the item to Goodwill or something, but the whole concept is so wasteful that I quit."
2020,2,"Stitch fix generally has stylish clothes and accessories. However the quality is poor for the price. After washing many of the pieces they developed a very shabby looking appearance. Also, with almost every single one of my fixes I had an article of clothing tear or rip after the first time I wore it. The customer service was good though. They would either send a replacement or credit my account. There is one other thing that bothered me. After trying about 17 fixes over the last few years I had finally found the best stylist. But then they gave me another one that was really bad so I ended up sending everything back. That was the last straw for me. It is a good model, especially for busy women but again the quality needs work."
2021,2,"Stitich Fix was great the first 6 months, but they stopped trying after that. I provided the stylist assigned to me plenty of feedback on what exactly I was looking for, and each shipment was a box full of random clothes.Disappointed I took a 4 month break. I recently restarted my deliveries and I just received a box that has two items that they sent to me (and I bought) last year! Super disappointed, I am cancelling my membership. Again, great for a few months, but if Stitich Fix wants to keep customers they need to start trying a little hard to listen to their customers."
2022,1,Worst company I have ever ordered from. I have continuously given chances and picked at least 1 thing in my box just to waive the $20 fee. After my last box I am so done!! I shouldn’t pay a stylist that doesn’t even fulfill my requests. I asked for a shorts only box. I literally received one pair of shorts that didn’t even fit (which is surprising considering they ask you to give very specific measurements). Before that I requested scalloped hemmed dresses. Did not receive any... my products are never what is requested. My “stylist” doesnt care about my care about my. And on top of it I can’t even cancel my subscription. They only offer to cancel auto ship or a box at a time. This is outrageous!
2023,3,"Their return policy is terrible. If you don’t return the clothes immediately, you aren’t able to return them at all. There’s something to be said about being able to return something within 30 or 60 days of purchase. You don’t realize how important that is until you’re stuck with pieces with tags still on that are too large because you lose 10 pounds."
2024,1,"I placed my order on March 18. Shipping was supposed to be 7-10 days. On the 11th day when I still had not received my order I sent a message through the ties.com website contact page. I did not get a response. When I click on 'track my package' it does not tell me where my package is. It just says on March 22nd, it is on it's way to the next facility.Then on April 1 I received an email from Ties.com asking me to let them know what I thought of my ties 'now that I had a chance to try them'. Considering my package never came, this was quite alarming to me. I have no idea where my package is or if it is even still coming.I spent $57 and so far I have received nothing from this site. I would not recommend ordering from this site."
2025,1,"Horrible customer service. I would really give them a minus 5 stars. Their site says they pay for returns. I placed an order for what I thought was a regular tie but I received an XL tie that was three feet long folded. I have no use for this super long tie and wanted to return it for credit for the amount that I paid , I would have applied that credit and paid extra money for the regular tie I wanted. Their rep wouldn’t listen and created a loose loose situation.. I lost the money I spent on the the tie because they didn’t honor their commitment to accept returns much less free returns. They lost a customer who would have continued to buy ties for my friends and clients and they lost future clients that I would have referred to them.. So they lost a very good customer. . Beware! Horrible customer Service and their returns commitment is a lie. I will never do business with ties.com again!"
2026,3,"After less than four months of ownership, 50% of the ties from this order are completely trashed. They look as though they've been chewed apart by a billy goat (I don't own a billy goat or any other animal.) I buy clothing as an investment. $20 bucks a tie is very affordable - if the ties are going to actually last even a year. I have ties that are over 5 years old that don't look anywhere near as badly as my ties.com ties do. It is not worth it to me to buy stuff that just falls apart, and most other people probably feel the same way.I am extremely disappointed, because I really wanted to like this service and use it in the future. This shipping was quick and packaging was slick - ties weren't quite what I was expecting but I overall liked the designs and material. Then, they started to disintegrate weeks into owning them."
2027,3,"The tie I received was damaged. I was unable to print the return label because I don't own a printer, and the woman I spoke to said her manager, Ilana, would not send me a return label through snail mail. I think that's pretty crappy customer service. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 as a courtesy because I've ordered from them in the past without issue."
2028,1,"I was a very loyal customer for almost 2 years, buying ALL my ties and socks from them. Because I liked the quality I decided to opt in for their subscription service. I figured, it says ALL OVER their website that they have such a great return policy, that you can return any item for any reason FOR FREE, so what do I have to lose? As it turns out, buried deep at the end of the legal disclaimer, NOT the return policy section, it says that in fact you CANNOT return anything from the subscription OR be refunded anything. So after I kept receiving things like a little vial of instant coffee (the kind they have in jail, why the F would I want a tie store to send me coffee??) , a cooling wipe in the middle of a polar vortex Ohio winter (the second coldest in my lifetime), I started to rethink the whole thing. The last box I received was FILLED with garbage. A gold leaf plated PLASTIC lapel pin?? Plastic collar stays?? ANOTHER INSTANT COFFEE DRINK?? I decided I wanted my money back. ( it also included a pair of solid aquamarine socks and a black and white polka dot bow tie, nothing even came close to matching). That’s when I found out that the website would not process my return. It didn’t say why, just that it couldn’t. So that’s when I literally read THE ENTIRE legal disclaimer page, from start to finish, and found that in the very last paragraph there are a couple of lines that say they won’t refund or accept returns for the subscription stuff. No reason, just that they don’t. This P’d me off, because every single purchase I had made up to that point was made with the understanding that I could return it (except the clearance items of course). Their return policy is one of the things they boast about the most, actually. So I called in (you HAVE to call in to cancel, but I did email them TWICE before calling and never got any response, even though it says you’ll get one in 24 hours or less) and when I explained what was happening, the customer service rep basically just said sorry, but that there wasn’t anything that could be done. When I said how they had just charged my card again for the next month of service just 2-3 days prior to my call and I wanted it refunded, he said the best he could do is give me a $20 code. Which, thanks I guess? But what about the other $50 you took from me? This is a total bait and switch. So be aware that they will in fact send you a bunch of useless crap that you will probably hate if you are as dumb as I was when I signed up for the subscription, and that they will not care if you’re not happy with what they sent. In fact, the subscription service isn’t even RAN by ties.com, which they neglect to tell you unless you call in and complain and demand your money back. I considered filing a claim with my credit card company to cancel the payment and refund the money, but instead I just informed the guy that I would just never shop there again. He didn’t care. I recommend the tie bar, they have a bigger selection and have better prices. The only reason I didn’t switch sooner is because I BELIEVE IN CUSTOMER LOYALTY. So basically, ties.com will burn you eventually. RANT COMPLETE."
2029,2,"I BOUGHT A GROUPON AND WHEN I CHOSE THE SCARF I WANTED AND THEN PROCEEDED TO CHECK OUT, I DISCOVERED THE ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS AMOUNT THEY CHARGE FOR SHIPPING. HONESTLY, I MAIL STUFF FROM THE U.S. ALL THE TIME BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN MAILING IT FROM CANADA. THE SCARF WEIGHS NOTHING AND THE CHARGE FOR SHIPPING WAS $22.95! COME ON, THAT IS SO OVERBLOWN IT IS A JOKE BUT NOW THAT I HAVE BOUGHT THE GROUPON, I AM STUCK WITH IT SO HAVE TO USE IT. NOT HAPPY AT ALL............WITH EITHER GROUPON OR THIS SITE. NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN."
2030,3,"I placed my order on 11/24. At the time, what I ordered was backordered until 12/7. On 12/7, I checked and it said backordered until 12/8. On 12/8, it said 12/9. Finally called them on 12/18 (it said it was backordered until 12/19). After voicing my frustration with the backordered dates, they allowed me to change my order to something in stock. I ordered the ""eggplant"" color assuming it was actually the color of egg plant. Instead, when it arrived it was like the orangish purple puke color. Ugly. I ordered it as a Christmas gift but it was too ugly to give to the recipient... so I think it'll be a Goodwill donation."
2031,2,I loved the color of the scarves and the way they looked on me. However one of the scarves I got had these studs on it and instead of sewing them on (which is possible because there were holes in either side of the stud) they just glued them on and it looked really cheap and I had one fall off the first time I wore it. I had my mom fix the scarf and now it's perfect. But I am really disappointed with scarves.com and especially since I live in Canada and I spent so much on international shipping costs. I will not shop at scarves.com again.
2032,3,"I ordered three scarves but once I received my order I received two of the same scarves. The third one I ordered was sold out. It would have been nice if I were notified that my selection was sold out before they shipped my order. I paid for three different scarves, not two."
2033,1,"I won this scarf. Opened the package , went to hold it up to show my boyfriend and my finger went right through the scarf. I now have a hole in a scarf that I haven't even really looked at yet. Cant get much cheaper than that. Do not waste your money on this cheap crap. No tag to say where it was made , but I can bet it was made in china."
2034,3,I ordered two lovely Caldera soaps in glass containers. One of the soaps was broken upon receipt. Emailed immediately to the contact listed on my order via PayPal. I also emaied pictures of the broken goods. Items were poorly packaged. I am very surprised both glass containers were not broken as packing materials were very sparse for the box they used for shipment. I am unhappy they have not gotten back to me to send a replacement or provide a refund.
2035,3,Is really easy to pay online and the service is fast in delivery but you can't cancel and order from the web. In my experience I have canceled and order at the call center and its been a month and haven't received my money back so I wrote and email and because the bank wouldn't accept the refund they just didn't send it and didn't call me. So I don't have a refund yet and I'm still trying to get it.
2036,2,Communication with Urbanfusion is virtually non-existent. I tried to contact them several times after I placed my order and could not contact anyone via phone or email. Finally the package arrived. Not an enjoyable transaction at all. Won’t order pandora jewelry from them again.
2037,2,"I will never use urban fusion again! I ordered $100 worth of Pandora charms and never received them. I called customer service and was told that they were delivered, so its my problem now. What company doesn't care about customer satisfaction?"
2038,3,"I ordered 3 charms that was supposed to be shipped in 3 days. Welp that didn’t happen. I had to call them to find out where the order was? 2 charms out of stock (bride tribe) & The Mrs. charm they had. Never was notified and they said it will be here basically whenever. No compensation, no apologies and by the way I still don’t have them."
2039,1,I have shopped urbanOg for yrs all of a sudden the site is different when you click on apparel there isn't any but still says they sell clothes something is fishy with urbanOG now bad reviews with no responses and the only responses you see is to the fake people who say they love it! I have spent hundreds of dollars with them and will never again..BE WARE! TRY GOJANE THEY HAVE SAME SHOES URBANOG HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY CROOKS!! IM SURE THIS REVIEW WONT BE POSTED!!! HAHAHAHAHA!!!!
2040,1,You guys have the worst of customer service. I have been ordering with you guys for years and one time that I have a lost package you guys refuse to refund me and just tell me to deal with it. Classic. I am for ever done ordering with you guys as well as any of my friends who I have ever told them about you guys.
2041,2,I orderd for my first time and I liked the50% percentoff there prices so I went ahead n orderd boots with my percentage n promo code n i checked out and I saw the total it was all good then only to be charged the full ridiclouse amount on my bank statement I tryed calling them but there closed I will call first thing Monday morning not a very good expierence for my first time with OG.Urban.co if they do not clear this up I want a full refund n won't shop with them ever n i shop alot when I find new shops online.
2042,3,Ordered My Shoes For An Event On The 26th of October...Needless To Say The Tracking Info Wasn't Up To Date. I Emailed Them For A Refund Once I Couldnt Be Provided With Correct Tracking Info. Never Got A Response Back About My Refund..Finally My Shoes Showed Up On 11/15...Almost A Month Smh Very Unsatisfied.
2043,3,Urbanog online is ridiculous. The quality of the shoes are cheap but you get what you pay for. I sent shoes back to the company they acknowledged that they received it but they never returned my money. When I kept asking for a refund they stopped responding to me.
2044,1,"Unhappy!!This is the kind of answers that you got from customer care if you have an international order missing or with delivering due date al already expired by USPS.If you dispute this with your bank or card company, we'll provide all the order information as well as the emails that have been sent to confirm we have been trying to assist you within our posted policies. You'll also be flagged and will no longer be able to shop on our website.

2045,3,"Customer service is so so bad, they do not really help you, It does not seem like they try to help you / or want to help you. If you ask them a question, then they respond in a very confusing way. They don't fully give you an answer you can actually use. I have waited SO long for my dilevery and still it hasn't arrived. Gojane's customer service doesn't help me find out with Post Office my package is being held at, nor give me any information where I can check it..."
2046,2,"I was so excited to find pink suede boots ($55) in my size at GoJane. After I put them in my cart, I continued to shop and found a very nice skirt ($15); the total for both was $70 so I applied the code for free shipping. The total came to $81, huh? I must have done something wrong. I emptied my cart and did it again. This time the total came to $90. I decided to wait until the next day, maybe my laptop was bunkers. Yesterday I spent all day trying to buy the boots and skirt and the total never came out to $70. Tried calling the 800-number but a machine came on and said there was no one there. No problem, I will try today. Emptied the cart and put the boots and skirt back in it. Yay, it said $70 until I put in the visa information; now it's $81 again. With free shipping and no tax, I can't see where the extra money is coming from. Tried to call -- no answer. One more time; emptied the cart and refilled it again, now the total is $90 again. That's it for me. I won't try this site again. I'm so disappointed.

2047,1,If I could give zero stars I would!! Used to spend hundreds of dollars with this company! I ordered shoes for my daughter on 4/30/19 was charged again for the same items on 5/1. Used to be able to get a human on the phone now they cut that off only allowing email. After several complaints via email they refunded the duplicate charge on 5/2 and then guess what?!! Took it again the same day! I did not authorize it they aren’t responding to my emails now I have paid a total of $60.48 for plastic Sandals when my total was only $30.24 filed a complaint with the BBB! I will never shop here again!!
2048,1,Please do not order from them! The clothes don’t fit and I returned all my items and never received my refund! They argued with me saying they never received it even though the tracking says otherwise. I lost over a hundred dollars ordering from them.. Stay away!!

I ordered a set of 14 gel polishes, rhinestones, and a drill bit but received 5 small bottles of gel polishes that I did not order! This company is a sham and robs people of their money! I doubt I will ever receive a refund or the right order. Never again! Buyer beware!! Learn from the rest of us!"
2050,1,"I placed an order on their website in January, and never received it. I had to open a dispute with paypal to get my money back. They say they have a warehouse in the US, but my order was coming from China. I purchase items from China on Ebay often and never have any issues with those. This company is a rip-off. Their instagram pictures have many complaints in the comments if people not receiving their orders, customer service ignoring their emails, and fake tracking numbers being provided. Buyers beware!

2052,2,"I’ve ordered a lot from this company and never had any problems. Myself and my daughter are having the same problem with them now. We have lots of missing items off our orders. You email them and they just constantly lie to you. I used to be a very loyal customer, but not anymore."
2053,1,"I ordered gel nail polish and a lamp about 3 weeks ago. Even paid for extra shipping so I could track my order. I got a confirmation of payment but after talking to an agent last week my order hasnt been shipped. Another customer agent wrote an email saying what I had paid for was all out of stock. I have asked for a full refund because I don't trust picking something else will work, since then I haven't gotten any response from these guys. Its so upsetting to pay all that money for something that isn't going to come. Bornpretty is a scam! I would advise anyone not to get anything here, these people won't even reply to your emails.

2054,3,"Ordered glasses last November 2018, got them a week and a half later but as soon as I opened the case l knew they were the wrong lenses. Sent me reading lenses when l ordered distance ones. Said right on the order distance. Now March and after numeres call's and emails no results."
2055,3,Probably won't use them again. They will give you a full refund if you don't like the glasses but they offer a pittance if you make mistake on your prescription. I should have put a plus sign and didn't. My bad on that. Customer service is very slow as well. Have talked to a few others who feel this is not a good service.
2056,1,"Really disappointed! I ordered my glasses on March 3,2019. 12 days have passed and nothing. “ processing for 12 days REALLY “. I called the day I ordered the glasses to make sure I did it correctly but they “are busy and not taking calls”. Extremely disappointed and not going to recommend or use firmoo again!!!!"
2057,3,This whole ordeal has been super frustrating. I got my glasses and the script is wrong. I contact customer service three times and they keep telling me I'm supposed to get an email in 24hrs. It's now 96hrs later! Guess what?! Still no response and now I'm stuck with two glasses that I can't see out of :(. I should've went to Costco....
2058,2,I had 3 prescriptions from the same doctor hoping they would be able to figure out the prescription. They repeatedly assured me they would put together a pair of glasses that were progressives for me. I came away with distance only glasses. I repeatedly tried reading with them and did a better job with them off. I’ll never buy from here again.
2059,1,"Horrendous. Paid $150 for a pair of raybans that I could have gotten for 119 on three different sites if I just looked. I mistakingly trusted that I was getting a deal because this site is billed as armed forces/law enforcement friendly. To make it worse, they sent me a coupon for they sent me a coupon for 20% off a purchase afterwards that they wouldn’t let me use it for this overpriced one. Then I ask about returns and they say it’s a mandatory restocking fee. Then to top off this experience they shipped via usps which left Texas and promptly flew off to Hawaii before coming back stateside to NY 10 days later to miss the secret Santa gift exchange Anyway. Not only will I never buy from you again I will make sure to share the experience with the 20,000 member service member/law enforcement gear circle that I am the founder of."

When the representative realized her mistake she asked me to return the additional lenses when they arrived (the company would cover shipping). I have no problem doing that... What bothers me is that the company was unwilling to expedite or even order my son's contacts until the other lenses (that were their mistake) were returned. My son shouldn't have to wait because of the company's mistake.
2061,3,The sunglasses I ordered were discontinued but there was no mention of discontinued on the website. I asked for express shipping and the items arrived the day I was leaving on the trip. This experience was not a good one as expectations were not met.
2062,1,I ordered Rx sunglasses and received the incorrect prescription. AFEyewear transcribed the wrong Rx and I had to return the sunglasses at my expense. So I paid over $400 for Rx sunglasses (Oakley) plus the return costs for their mistake. No way to get reimbursed. Email listed for this kept returning non-deliverable. I work overseas supporting the US Army and will not recommend this company.
2063,1,"I ordered a pair of glasses from afeyewear.com on 3/15/17 for $492 and received the wrong lens shape so I sent them back with pictures. They took 4 weeks to receive the corrected pair.The day after I received them I took them to the local optician to have the frames sized and adjusted for y face. She cleaned them with a professional cloth and spray and they easily scratched. I tried to clean them with water and soft towel and they scratched again. Their lens and eye glass warranty as listed on their page reads:“If you're not absolutely, positively 100% satisfied with your prescription lenses, return them within 30 days and we'll remake them at no cost. No questions asked! We'll even pay for the shipping--both ways!”Well they denied this warranty and said it didn't cover scratches but only manufacture defects. I said obviously they forgot to put the scratch coating on because of how soft and easy the lenses scratched after a professional cleaning. They charged me an additional $120 to remake the lenses and I received them 8 weeks after ordering my glasses. I will never do business with this company again. Many people have stated on the BBB site that they were coerced into changing their opinions on here in for a favorable outcome. I just felt like others should know the truth about this company. I am a disabled veteran and feel like I was taken advantage of by a company that advertises armed forces discounts. The discount is because they make you pay for cut corners, false advertising and poor customer service!"
2064,3,I've ordered from them twice. Both times they never provided me with a date to expect the glasses. In this last order I had to email them asking about my order status and still haven't received a response. I am not sure why I paid for expedited shipping if their process was so unpredictable to begin with. I am not pleased. At least respect me enough to reply to my email.
2065,3,"My glasses were sent for replacement lenses for a mild prescription on the 21st of September, it is not October 10th and they still haven't been returned. I have had to call 4 times to ask where my glasses are, and every time the *same* customer service agent is confused as to ""why they haven't shipped yet, because they're ready"". Then, I was guaranteed that they would be shipped that day. Same story for the next 3 times I called. I'm hoping they are perfect when they arrive. Boooo."
2066,2,"The worse customer service I ever experienced. Glasses are fine and finally got them, they have no tracking system in place and every time I’ve called the least I’ve waited is 35mins on hold. I don’t think I’ll ever reorder, good luck!!"
2067,1,I sent along my prescription and they denied having received it...I also sent along my notes duplicating the prescription verbatim. They made an error in one of the lenses and instead of taking responsibility they balmed me...It cost me an additional $32.00 Beware!
2068,3,"I put them on and bifocal is so low, I had to take them into the eye doctor to check. He agreed. The bottom of the glasses has to be moved further up. There are bubbles in glasses and numbers etched in the glass you can see when you hold them up in the light. Can you help me in this process?"
2069,3,"I sent in two pairs of brand new frames. The lenses they put in are great, but they lost the nose pad on one of my frames. They were very kind to contact me in advance about it and own up to it, but what could I do at that point? They replaced the nose pads with generic ones and gave me a $15 discount (total order was in excess of $300), but the generic nose pads fell off and I had to get more from a local optician and super glue them to the frame. Not happy about that at all. Probably won't go back, which is a shame because I have a couple more frames that need lenses..."
2070,3,"On their website, they claim to have a price matching guarantee, but when you mention other sites that sell the same frames for less, their staff is trained to fabricate reasons on the spot why those other sites aren't included in their price matching guarantee. I can't trust a company that uses dishonest tactics such as this, and neither should you.UPDATE: In their reply to my oiriginal review (below) they cite their stated policy on price matching. I read that policy before I called them. The simple fact is, they do not honor that policy. Period. Full stop.UPDATE 2 (Response to merchant's 2nd response): All any potential customer has to do is call you to find out that (a) your ""cost"" is always the price you have the item listed for, and (b) as I've said (and as your response illustrates) you don't price match.The fact is, I would have bought the frames as well as future products from you without hesitation had you not had the price matching baloney posted on your website - that dishonest tactic is doing you more harm than good.Finally, I didn't give my name when I called, so how did you know which part of your ""price matching"" policy didn't apply in my case? You're digging yourself deeper with each response."
2071,2,I have been a loyal customer for many years until now. I have purchased at least four pair of glasses all being Ray-Ban. This last pair I have had two years and the lens started peeling. They are progressive without any scratch coating applied. I called them to see if anything could be done and they said no because the warranty ran out. They then said they could give me a 10% discount on my next pair. They were already offering this to anyone who purchases them on line anyway. I am very disappointed with this as I have been as loyal as an old dog to them.. Could they spare it? Really? 10%.. So now I am looking for a new place to purchase my eye glasses.
2072,1,"I wasn't notified that my frames were backordered for two months until after I'd placed the order, and SimplyEyeglasses.com did nothing to help the situation. I love the design - they're definitely the frames I wanted and I'm happy with them - but I wouldn't recommend SE.com as a place to purchase your eyewear."
2073,1,"The initial ordering process was smooth, but the problems arose with timing and delivery. The glasses were late, and there was considerable hassle with the shipping.After reading many reviews of online eyeglass makers, I ordered over the phone with Stephanie, who provided a price match for the frames. She informed me that the glasses should arrive in about two weeks via two day shipping.I contacted them at two weeks less one day, since I had not yet received a shipping notification and tracking number. Linda responded and said the glasses should ship out that day, or possibly, the next day. This was on a Thursday, and I received no shipping notification on either Thursday or Friday.I called on Monday and spoke with Tracy. She stated that the glasses would ship out on Tuesday. After considerable back and forth, she finally agreed to find out why they hadn't shipped out the previous week, as promised. It turned out that one of the lenses had been broken while being made. She assured me, however, that they would ship out on Tuesday. I asked for expedited shipping. She agreed to two day shipping. I explained that I already had two day shipping. It turned out I had seven day shipping. If I had stuck it out with their delayed lens making and delivery, I would have received the glasses the following Tuesday, maybe, a full three and a half weeks after I ordered -- 1.5 weeks late.I asked for overnight shipping, since the glasses were already late. Tracy stated that this could not be done since her supervisor had already gone for the day; this was at 3 pm EST. She stated that I should just cancel my order since I did not seem satisfied. I replied that I found it strange there was no one there who could approve overnight shipping. She, again, repeated that I should just cancel my order and then put me on hold. When she came back, she said that the glasses would be done that day, Monday, but that they could not do the overnight shipping. I asked, again, for overnight shipping since the order was late, and she repeated, yet again, that I should just cancel my order, that they were not making any money on my order. Plus I should have known, she said, that the order might take a while due to my high prescription. (When I placed my order with Stephanie, there was no mention of potential problems with my prescription). Tracy, again, put me on hold, and when she came back, she stated they could do overnight shipping. She then put me on hold again to check that the person working on my glasses would continue to do so, because apparently in the back and forth between the lab and herself, some uncertainty was created regarding whether the lab wanted to continue making my glasses.This entire exchange took some time, and it was very unsatisfactory. Tracy's attitude and statements conveyed that I was extremely lucky that SimplyEyeglasses.com agreed to make my glasses. I asked for an email address for Tracy's supervisor. I received an email address for Cindy, to whom I sent an email detailing the exchange. It's been two weeks, and I have not received a response. The glasses themselves are fine, which is the reason for the two stars rather than a single star. But their customer service is very poor. They should have provided more realistic timing in the first place, and once the problem with the broken lens arose, they should have contacted me with an update. Absent an update, they should have been more willing to nail down the reasons for the continuing delay and to immediately speed up the making of the glasses and their delivery. Instead, I had to call them and then got a lot of grief for asking for expedited shipping of an item which was already late.I would not recommend SimplyEyeglasses.com."
2074,3,My glasses were awful. Completely blurry. I sent them back for correction and have not heard hide nor hare from the company. It's as if I sent them into a black hole.
2075,3,"My first glasses there must have been a misunderstanding, they were not progressive as I had thought I was ordering. They only had reading and mid range. You gave me a credit and replaced them. The second pair, did not have the reading portion high enough in the lens so they only work if I lift the glasses a bit. The reading script is too low. I am afraid to order more pairs, which had been my intention because I don't know how to get it right. If someone contacts me and explains how this problem can be solved I will buy more from you."
2076,2,Not happy at all allot of misscommunication. Was told the frames o picked there to big now there to small. My bifocals line is in the middle of my site line looking straight ahead I was told to wear the glasses farther down my noise! Also whatever coating is on these materials make them a smudge magnet in 50 year of wearing glasses I never had to clean them like every 5 minutes won't be using there service again.
2077,3,"Glasses made poorly, weird reflections through lenses. Returned. Was told nothing wrong erroneously, had a recheck done and was told yes, they are defective. Feels like Zenni was trying to get out of taking responsibility. Also, have had to contact customer service several times because the contact I have been promised several times never happens. Still waiting on promised refund. Originally told only 50 percent refund even though product was defective! Now promised full refund after I wait to talk to customer service again."
2078,2,I’ve had great past experiences with this company. This past experience was a little disappointing. I was billed the amount of my purchase as in the past but this time I was billed a substantial amount more than my receipt said when I called to inquire they said it had been changed to U.S. dollars. This had never happened to me in the past. When I checked the website there is nowhere that says USD.This is very misleading and as far as I’m concerned is dishonest. I will certainly be looking for other sites for my next purchase. You should update your site as to no mislead future clients.
2079,1,I paid for my prescription sunglasses approximately 6 weeks ago. They said delivery 10-12 days. At 21 days they didn't answer an email on the status. Got through on day 22 and was told the glasses broke in grinding and would ship within 2-3 days. One more follow-up and they said would ship next day and send confirmation number. NOTHING. Now 6 weeks...emails for status go unanswered. Complete SCAM IMHO! I will never use them again. I would never recommend them.
2080,3,"Just like the previous poster, I ordered my RX sunglasses back on Feb 20th, It's now March 28th. Still no glasses. Very poor if any communication on them. Have said they've not passed inspection twice and had to be sent back....really? No response in emails after days of asking. They have several email addresses listed on their web page for communications but no one responds. Terrible customer service and no $472 glasses to comment on. Ticked Off!"
2081,3,"I have bought prescription lenses numerous times from ADS and until my last transaction, had a positive experience. My last transaction was shipped to the incorrect address. I alerted the staff to this, and the excuse I got was that on their internal system, it showed the address they shipped to. The address I specified was printed on the receipt so there is a problem with their system. This is not my problem and I'm not interested in why it was incorrectly shipped.I was able to recover the item and have it forwarded to me, but it's resulted in an an additional two weeks to receive the item. I was in a hurry to get item for a golf trip so the delay was very disappointing.I received a sincere apology, but unfortunately an apology doesn't do anything to help my situation. I believe in retail, when the vendor makes a mistake they have to stand behind it and make a gesture like a store credit and provide an assurance that they will do whatever it takes to make sure I be whole in case the goods can't be recovered.

2082,2,"Horrible customer service and didn't deliver product!! I recently attempted to order two pairs of safety glasses for my son's deployment to Africa. I was told that I would have my glasses in 5 days. After 7 days I called and was given the run around and told that they the person who was working on the issue call. They never did. I attempted to call numerous times and every time I telephoned the phone would pick up and they would hang up on me. I then went to the store since they were unreachable via telephone and they then told me the order would take 7-10 days even though I was told it would be delivered that day. This was a very important order and now my son gets to head to Africa without the glasses and sunglasses he wanted so much. Truly horrific service and the employees don't care.ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REVIEW: We DID let this company know that my son was being deployed and we ASSURED and TOLD that we would receive the order in 5 business days. I WAS HUNG UP on and never received calls back and it took me going into the store to receive any straight answers. Truly horrible customer service and as you can see my the response, this company won't take ownership for THEIR mess up. My son is now sitting in Africa on deployment with the two pairs...two pairs of glasses that he wanted. YOU DON'T CARE!! If you did, you would have picked up the phone and tried to make this right!"
2083,2,"I am giving two stars because this is my second order with ads sports eyewear. Obviously the first experience was good because I went back. This time, wow!! I ordered 3 weeks ago and emailed them for status. The company NEVER responded. I called today and was given every excuse for every issue. There has been an issue with the servers but they try to answer every email quickly. Seems that it is a common excuse to pass the blame. Where are my glasses? We will be getting them out today. How convenient that you found them when I called. This is a second rate company and will never get my business again."
2084,3,I have purchased several sunglasses in the last couple of years. This year I wanted to return a pair of sunglasses since they didn’t fit my face. The return process is a bit much plus paying to return an item on postage is a bit much. At the end it’s like a $20 deduction if you include shipping cost and restocking fee plus add another $20 for the time I have to go to the postal office. Unfortunately framesdirect has failed with this part of there service.
2085,3,"Glasses received and were fine;however, the delivery took almost 3 weeks. I was told originally they would be shipped in 2-3 days. I paid extra to have them come by UPS. I did not get a tracking number. About 10 days later I got an email giving a date that it would arrive but no tracking number. It did not arrive on that date and again I got an email giving me a delivery date in a couple more days. My order did not arrive. I responded to the email asking for my tracking number. Using that number I found my order had just left framesdirect that day. I received the order on the day the UPS tracking number had listed."
2086,2,"I still have not received my new order even though I paid for expedited shipping. You are located in Austin and I am New Braunfels. It would have been faster for me to pick the frames up in person.I have also sent my first order back and have not yet received a refund.I received an email about my replacement order stating that one of the frames was no longer available. Instead of just sending what remained of the order, the email said that they were putting my order on hold until they heard from me. That is crazy. Just fulfill the order as best you can.I ordered four frames this time so that I can choose something that will work from several options. The email that I received from you implied that perhaps I was ordering for underhanded purposes. I am not affiliated with an eyewear business. Just a regular person wanting options. When I conveyed that to the gal who sent the email, she informed me that there is a 10% restock fee for returned frames. I do not recall seeing that rule listed in your return policy.With all of this said, please just give me a refund for my first return and send me my new order. Thank you,Kim Brandsma."
2087,2,"Horrible customer service and inventory online is incorrect. I was sent sunglasses that were damaged. A representative named Pam attempted to threaten me with a “secret video” that was made during quality inspection, which made me think she was trying to say I damaged the glasses. I would never use this company again. "
2088,1,"Super cheap lenses!!! Having worn glasses now for 20 years I've never had a major scratch on one of my glass lenses. Now less than 2 months after owning my new Frames Direct glasses there is a major gouge without ever having dropped them and having my typical gentle usage I've always had with all my other glasses. When I called customer service their attitude was basically ""too bad."" I will never purchase glasses from them again and will steer everyone I know away from this retailer. Lenses that scratch so easily must be of a super cheap quality. AVOID!"
2089,3,"When we first ordered the goggles for our 1st grade daughter for soccer, we were excited to have them in time for the upcoming games. However, there was a mishap in the order, apparently he tint wouldn't work. So they Upsold us to transitional lenses. That was corrected in 2, 3 days from order date. They said there will be an additional charge in which they provided a discount. We approved. However, weeks went by And no goggles. Apparently, they didn't charge the card the additional fee. So I had to do that finally another anorher week and after a phone call we manually had to make the additional fee. Today we still do not have the goggles, our season is ending in two weeks. I'm also consirned if they will even fit right. We ordered these on may 2nd of 2019 and we still do not have them today or even know when they will be shipped."
2090,3,"I was hopeful these would be long lasting for our son but after about three weeks they are broken from normal 11 year old wear. The side pieces are actually two parts that lead into the temple curve. The red part broke so my son continues to wear them with only half the side piece until we can order new ones from somewhere else.In response to below--- yes, this is my maiden name, my email attached to this should match your records. I spoke with customer service and am awaiting a reply as it has been two weeks since received."
2091,3,"Still Waiting!...I ordered the goggles on 3/13/19 and am still waiting to receive them on 4/4/19. I did not expect them to be held by customs. If I knew they were from China (should have done my research first, that's on me), I would have not made this purchase. Insult to injury, I still do not have them in hand. An expensive purchase that I should have made locally."
2092,3,"Ordered ski google inserts 4 weeks before I neede them. After 2 weeks, they hadn’t even started the order. When I called to check the status, they confirmed that it wasn’t started and offered $10 off of an additional $30 to “rush” the order. Apparently 4 weeks is not long enough."
2093,3,"the sunglasses did what they are expected to do. My problem was that they don't last. It was less than a year that my sunglasses started to go. Finally I emailed the company and they would send me the required part (of course not through warranty, because sun glasses shouldn't last a year). They were discontinued, probably because they don't last. Anyway the sales team offered to sell be the part I need, but I would have to take a lot more parts I don't need for an exorbitant amount. Poor quality and customer service/."
2094,3,"Glasses broke after 1 week. Called Customer Service. They said no problem - send photos. I had to resend photos to two different departments. They say there is a warranty, they say there is an ""I LOVE IT GUARANTEE"". Now they are refusing to give me a full refund. Plus I had to pay to ship them back."
2095,3,Just a company that is lacking in every measurable way to provide a minimum amount of customer service. They have no accountability for their incompetence. They do not deliver when promised and then are offended when you ask why and if it is delayed once again they are upset that you had nerve to except to be updated.
2096,1,"If I could give a zero rating I would. Buyer beware. I ordered frames with a 1-5 business days shipping. They still haven't even shipped and I am on day 6!! Was told by customer service that they had to order the frames from a manufacturer. Yet on website said it was in stock. And now I am being charged a 10% ""restocking"" fee when I canceled my order before it even has shipped!"
2097,3,"Poor User-Interface.Very easy to use. Great prices.Wasted my time ordering prescription glasses they can't even put together because the lenses need to be ""flat"". My question is why are the options there with those type of sunglasses. Why not say, ""This prescription requires a flat lense and is not compatible with these glasses"" while the customer is inputting the data! Now I will be charged some sort of cancellation fee because of the cancellation fee stipulations.... this site just went from being cool to terrible."
2098,1,Very shady company. Trust these negative reviews and stay away. No where do they state under their return policy that they charge a 15% restocking fee if your glasses arrived damage. To add insult they make you pay the return shipping fee. They never returned my phone calls or answered emails. Good luck in them answering the phone.
2099,3,2 of the 4 contacts I've opened so far were warped and dried out. I have 2 left and am willing to bet at least one of those is too. Not sure if its manufacturer problem or just an old box but feel like I was cheated.Edit: they told me in the reply to contact their warranty department.....which turned around and sent me to acuvue. Tried to make it look like they help but all they do is say they cant help.
2100,2,"Tried to tell me the more expensive contacts were a part of my prescription. The brand of contact lenses or glasses you wear have nothing to do with your prescription. The prescription are the numbers, not the brands you wear. Also, the contact brand that was on my prescription paperwork was a PROMOTION! You guys will never get my money again. Lost my business over $91."
2101,2,"$132.10 handling fee and slow mailing service without paying more money. Will definitely not be using OptiContacts again. One line search showed them as inexpensive for the contacts I needed and then after going through the order process they kept adding on more costs. To add: I was also denied my $200.00 rebate. OptiContacts offered and sent me this rebate, saying that ""I need to order a years supply to quality"" and now I have been denied the rebate. The rebate company said the rebate is not allowed from this company (meaning OptiContacts)."
2102,2,At the time I ordered the contacts my daughter really needed them. OptiContacts knew when we ordered they were not in stock. Until the next day did they tell us they are out of stock. They whole point of ordering from them is for the saving. We can’t wait for a whole month for the back order so we were forced to go to our eye doc and pay the same price for one pair that we paid for a whole box of 6 pair. Be honest to your customers. I don’t think I will order from them again.5-7 days and a month is a big difference and not honest.
2103,2,"13 days and still no product. I called today and they cannot guaranteed any delivery date because they don't know when they will receive my contacts from the distributor. I definitely will no be ordering from them again.In reply to your reply: You knew the product wasn’t available when I ordered and you never let me know there would be a delay. I needed these contacts a week ago, and had I known it would be 2 weeks before I received my product, I would have adjusted my expectations accordingly or made other arrangements. You won this battle, and kept my order this time, but this will be the last order I place with you."
2104,2,Received the glasses but the prescription felt wrong. I took it to my localOptometrist and they told me the glasses I received were not the same as the prescription I had submitted! Not cool. They did say this was a common practice with online lens companies. Lesson learned! I’m out a couple hundred bucks but I do like the frames so I’m going to get the glasses prescription done RIGHT by professionals!
2105,2,"I purchased some sunglasses for my wife’s birthday from coolframes.co.uk. A delivery date wasn’t available which was strange but I trusted the site thinking it was a UK company. Once my money had been taken, a little over 2 weeks later I received a bill for import tax of £45 which I wasn’t made aware of. This unfortunately increased the price and it would of been cheaper purchasing them directly from the Fendi website. I emailed the company twice and tried calling but know one could even have the decency to get back in touch. Appalling service and extremely misleading. I will never purchase from this company again."
2106,2,"ordered flexon 603 with 145 mm temples. They sent them with 140 mm temples. Numbers are clearly stamped on temples. Tried to tell me that even though they are stamped 140 they are really 145. Bottom line, they want me to pay to ship them back and they will see what they can do. Don't know what to do with these glasses that don't fit. I'll figure something out but I'm done with these guys."
2107,1,"One Star because I can't give 1/2 star or zero star. Never in my life I've seen such appaling service. I've placed an order 2 months ago, had to pay and additional 23 pounds tax fee when the product arrived in the uk (information that was not clear on the website). I am still trying to track my item with the Royal Mail, but they took zero responsibility for the mess and keep referring me to the Royal Mail website. Still waiting for the item. If you are considering placing an order, run away from this website as soon as possible!!!! Awful in every single way."
2108,1,"Seriously poor service from Coolframes. Returned a set of frames as they were faulty. After 4 weeks from confirmed delivery of frames to the store, no update. Chased by email and told 2-4 week wait for update, they basically did nothing until they got my email.Customer Service is a joke, they charge to process and ship back faulty good they supplied. Oh and they just hang up if you ask why they're charging for a warranty return.Seriously avoid! Shop elsewhere!

2109,3,"The glasses I bought broke one week after I got them. It was the metal frame with an octagon shape, multiple color frame. I loved them but the arm broke the first week. Totally heart broken."
2110,2,"purchased over 5-6 pair of glasses also my mother in law purchased the same amount, I called in stated 3 out of the 6 pair were not made correctly due to my script not changing they were not correct and all I was told that I can send them back which was to china I was told and that was gonna cost about 300.00 or get a lousy discount on my next pair?????? So I have 3 pair of cute frames that I cant wear and if I take them elsewhere they will charge like 300.000 to put in my script! so I am out of money and wasted time. I will no longer purchase from this site again."
2111,3,"I received glasses that don't fit and have the wrong prescription. After an hour and a half chatting online, they still refused to tell me how to make a return, and gave me a fraudulent phone number. Their customer service people gave me the run-around and I still have the glasses I can't use, and no response from them after multiple attempts."
2112,3,"The first pair I purchased, the ear stem broke with a week. I purchased a second pair. The ear stem broke in a couple of hours. I have pairs of glasses that cost more and less than yours and I have never had a problem with any of them."
2113,3,Never in my freaking life had to wait a month of longer just to receive a order. It said 10-15 days not weeks!! Don’t get me wrong they have a beautiful selections of frames but it isn’t worth waiting a month for. When u contact customer service they keep saying it will be there shortly. It exercise your anxiety to keep checking the mailbox everyday and no product!
2114,2,Worst experience everIt took me a month to wait for the same reply saying they were waiting for the order to be on the stock. I had to cancel the order at the end because it was just too much. I had to follow up with the order everytime and i got the same reply twice. I am a regular contact user. I got the good deals on the site so it was my first time ordering. Never going back again.
2115,1,"I will never use this company again. I order the Vogue sunglasses for my wife for mother’s day on Thursday May the 9th and paid $34.99 for next day shipping. The sunglasses didn’t arrive until Monday the 13th, Ezcontact contact would only refund me $10.00 of the $34.99 I paid for next day shipping. I had great experience with this company up until now. I will no longer do business with this company nor would I recommend anyone to do business with this company. I hope the shipping cost was worth losing a customer for life!"
2116,2,I ordered my contacts at the beginning of April and finally got them at the end of May. Many phone calls to customer service with long hold times were frustrating. Being classed for an entire week over the Passover holiday added to my negative experience. My order was not double checked with my prescription as they state is standard practice in their on hold message and they were wanting to hold me accountable for that. I have ordered for years but will not again.
2117,1,"I ordered two frames on this past Saturday, paid for next day shipping. I checked the status Monday only to find it’s still processing. What the heck! Next day shipping means they should have shipped Monday. I spoke to a representative that wasn’t the friendliest and advised next day shipping means, if they are in stock. How the hell am I supposed to know if they are in stock when I placed the order nothing said they weren’t. I demanded a credit for 30 something odd dollars in expedited shipping and nothing yet. Long story short I was told they would ship this coming Friday, if not I’m canceling my order and telling EVERYBODY I know to stay clear of this company. Sad."
2118,3,"Yes, I got a lower price than the local eye glasses shop. The only issue is that they haven't arrived. I was told to expect a delivery by 5/27. Now it's 6/5 and I still get the same info when I track the order: ""Estimated delivery by the end of the day."" I called the post office and found out the label was created but never shipped. I had wanted these glasses for a trip and now I'm just hoping they arrive at all."
2119,1,"This the worst company to work with. I placed an order for sunglasses on 4/10/2018 but few days later I saw that money was taken from my credit card but I did not receive my sunglasses and there were no emails on when the order was shipped. Therefore I decided to call company myself to find out what is going on. Lady i spoke with told me that they are checking to see if they have any in stock. On 4/18/2018 I received email saying that they would refund money back to my credit card because they do not have my glasses available. Also, email stated that I should see money within 3-4 business days. However, I today is 5/3/18 and I still do not have my refund. I emailed and called them but all I hear is that Refund Department is checking on it. However, nothing is getting done. I would not recommend anybody to purchase anything from this company. They are unreliable and not trust worthy. They took money before they found out that they do not the product I purchased and I still can not get my money back.

2120,1,"I was searching for a reliable place to update the prescription on my frames and came across Replacement Lens Express. Their process seemed straightforward: fill out the lens requirements, include your prescription and then send your glasses in to them. After having my glasses for over a week, I get an email notifying me that they could not fulfill my order because as they were trying to replace the frames, it was starting to crack on the lower right bottom. When I assured them that I checked over the frames before I sent them and that everything was fine, all I got was a ""Sorry! When you send in your own frame it is at your own risk as stated on the web site."" Followed with an offer for me to send in a different pair if I wanted to. That was what really got me, why in the world would I risk sending in another pair of my glasses to this company when they already damaged my first pair and did not even have the courtesy to try to fix the issue other than with a one word apology ('Sorry!')?So let this be a buyer beware for any potential customers out there, sure there are customers here who have given this company good reviews- IF actually were able to get their glasses done but what happens when they damage your property? You're basically SOL with a pair of unusable glasses and without the option of even trying to get the lenses replaced elsewhere because your frames are broken. Not worth the risk in my opinion."
2121,1,"be careful and wary before making your final decision. my experience is that it took more than a month for the express service to be processed and shipped. that is of course after receiving a letter earlier stating that they were shipped, but after not receiving anything the order was double checked only to discover that there was an error and actually my order was defective so that had to redo it. finally it arrived but one lens is incorrect being 3/4 of a number too low ! and the prism ordered was also not accurate.also i am not sure the lab manufactured lens is top qualityso be careful, read more comments and decide for yourself if the price justifies the chance it will be okayin terms of returns i will have to wait and see what they can do.i am overseas and not counting in the overseas time for usps shipping which was actually very fast . the glasses were held up in customs but that is not relevant to my complaint but to others also ordering from overseas.

2122,1,"Remade lenses three times, they kept getting the prescription wrong. After third mistake I wanted a refund. I shipped back the bad lenses and they refused to refund. I had to take it up with Visa to force a refund, and they kept fighting. I eventually got the money back. Very rude and unskilled at manufacturing.
Edit: Nice try, RLE. Since they questioned my authenticity and patronage, here are excerpts from the order details. 
Refund email after two reworks STILL failed to produce the correct prescription:
Date: 5/16/16
Yes, if you would like a full refund, please send the lenses back. 
After faulty lenses were received, they offer Paypal or check and refuse to issue refund directly to original payment method (credit card).
Date: 5/23/16
Do you have a Pay Pal account for the refund to go to? If not, we can send a check to you for the refund. 
I wait two more weeks for check to arrive, then give them a few calls. They say their accounting software shows the check had been cashed. Scam alarms go off and I start a Visa dispute with my bank. I never received a check or made any deposit. My bank saw the supporting evidence and issued a refund. I never heard from RLE again, until now that I'm sharing my experience. Stay far, far away."
2123,3,"First the good review. I ordered an initial pair of glasses from them without a problem and they did good work. Things went horribly wrong when I ordered a second pair. Their website would not process the same credit card I had used the first time. I kept getting error messages. I finally received a phone call from one of their employees who assured me that none of the charges went through, but she would take a phone order. They never processed it or called me back to explain that they could not process a phone order. I then became concerned that maybe my prior attempts at online orders had actually resulted in charges to my credit card. Sure enough, there were five (5) charges to my card! They were only willing to back out the charges, but not offer any sort of resolution to me for what literally ended up being hours of my time chasing down charges from their flawed system. I was told that they are a very small company and they could not afford to waive or reduce charges to address customer complaints. If they are so small that a $70 pair of glasses is too much expense for them to absorb, I personally would be concerned about their ability to ever remedy significant problems with their products.

2124,1,"This business advertises that they have something in stock. When they actually do not. I ordered biofinity toric contact lenses. A few days later I got an email saying that the order was delayed 7-10 business days. 7-10 business days I called them and they said it was going to be 7-10 business days more. No notification, no email, I had to call them. Absolute waste of your time. Do not buy from them.

2125,3,"Ordered my Biofinity lens 6/19/15 and was not told until 6/30 that they were on back order and I would be notified when shipped. That was 2 wks after ordering! No notification came and and when I called on 7/1, I was told they were shipping that day. Rec'd notification 7/3 (!) that lens just shipped. Not good PR. Not satisfied w/ service."
2126,1,"Absolutely awful customer service and cheap product. Stand clear of this organization. They do not stand behind their product and their website is meant to rope you in to having to make purchases with them even though their products are subpar. Save yourself time and energy, do NOT buy from them. There are plenty of other eye glass vendors."
2127,3,"I placed my order for contacts ONE MONTH ago and have called them twice over that span of time asking for an update on my order. They say the lenses are on backorder with CooperVision and it is out of their hands. That was two weeks ago. I called a week ago and got the same story. It would be one thing if their website stated that the lenses were on backorder/out of stock, but it didn't and gave every impression they would be able to fulfill my order in a timely manner. Truly awful service and not worth the $5 I saved by not ordering from my usual contact service."
2128,2,"Ordered my contacts through them because they offered 1 day shipping, or so I thought. A few days later I still didn’t receive my contacts and was told that even though I paid for 1 day shipping, it was sent to ups priority 3-5 day shipping. Nobody informed me of this until I called lens discounters. I asked for a refund and they told me I they could not give me one since my contacts were shipped (but nobody knows where they are) I will never purchase from this company again."
2129,3,"2 out of my last 3 orders they mailed me the wrong sized bags. Not even close to what was ordered where one dimension was correct but they just grabbed the wrong ones, but no shared dimensions at all. With them being small orders, I haven't found it worth complaining about $14, but their accuracy of shipping what gets ordered has gotten pretty poor."
2130,3,"The only reason why Im giving this a bad review is this:I purchased the mats for my artwork for a gallery showing.The new slip in mats was not easy peasy @ all. I broke several ones, trying to insert them, and I also received paper cuts, inserting them.I paid $77.00 for that bulk, and I also had to use glue to keep the mat, together, because I had forcefully inserted my prints and tore the mats. I still like clear bags. Somethings are'nt as good as they seem.Maria Kalaff, Craft artist."
2131,3,Hello I boughtthe clearflat compostable bags and wanted to test them before I put my products in them . My whole mission is to reduce plastics. I have had your bags outside in my compost pile for along time and they are not showing any signs of composting. I would like my money back as this compostability is crucial. Please test your products before selling them. Heres to a plastic free future.
2132,2,"I always ordered my show kits from clear bags and my sleeves and many other things. I am an Artist and used you quite often in the past. This time when I ordered my show kit they gave me 20 sleeves, 20 backing and only 10 double mats. I called customer service, talked to 2 different representatives and they refused to send me the other 10 mats. It was very disappointing. They actually wanted me to pay for them. This is the first time clear bags ever did anything like that to me. Since I am an artist and have many friends who are how am I to give a good recommendation on your company. I was very frustrated, especially when I called and was treated like that. I guess I will find another company to order from for a measley 10 mats that you gave me such a hard time about which I paid for."
2133,3,"I like the products and speed of delivery but the customer service is very poor. We are a wholesale food manufacturer and therefore do not charge sales tax to our customers. We are not required to have a reseller certificate but instead supply a uniform exemption certificate. The customer service staff refused to acknowledge this (this is a standard thing for wholesale businesses) and was very difficult to work with. Each order we have to go through the whole process again, which is very frustrating."
2134,2,"The quality of the plastic we ordered for the 1st year was great. However the last three orders were terrible. I called to informed them of the quality issue, but got nowhere. They asked for proof of the problem, i provided proof and nothing was addressed. So, I say good buy to them."
2135,2,"I have ordered many poly bags for our concession business from other suppliers. The bags I received from you were unacceptable! They were all thrown into a box and I there was no way I could confirm I had received what I ordered, both for the 2 sizes of bags. There was no separation or quantity pre packaging. I wont be ordering again."
2136,3,"I was looking for a clear bag. After receiving the product I called customer service. I was told next time to order clear food bags which are polyethylene bags. She stated I could return the item which was nice, but I need crystal clear 20x20 bags. The person that I spoke to before placing the order stated the bags are clear. I need clear yet crystal clear bags."
2137,3,"About the 5th time they have shipped us bags that are just loose in the box and not prepackaged in bags of 100...this is after a big ""to do"" several months ago and phone calls to supervisors/owners asking them to note on our account that we do not want loose packed bags-only the ones prepacked in 100s..we work in food service and the loose bags are NOT acceptable. We have called and spoken with them on multiple occasions, even been contacted and requested to change a previous review. All this done with the understanding that measures were being implemented to prevent this from happening again. Our last shipment of bags arrived in damaged boxes with loosely packed bags that had slid around and become jumbled. Not that we doubt the quantity of bags, but there is no way to quantify/check quantities and organize the mess that arrives in these boxes."
2138,3,"Product shown online was nothing like the product that arrived. We ordered AMBER food bags for our pet treats which were supposed to be partially transparent. We received chocolate brown solid bags. They blamed it on their photographer? Poor guy/gal! They did agree to the return and we hope our money is credited back as they agreed. HOWEVER, Their mistake cost us exhibiting our product at a national trade show. They were quick to respond. But their product representation was very poor."
2139,3,"We sell organic vegan beverages that are best kept chilled and stored at 4 degrees centigrade. We ordered 750 SL309 6"" x 3"" Inkjet Weatherproof labels and they are horrible. Our ink runs and smears. This product is not as described."
2140,1,"Our labels were shipped with the wrong color. When you have a company and branding matters, this is unacceptable. We raised the concern, and they called back to inform us that they simply weren't going to help us. They fell back on a notable caveat in their terms...wait for it:They don't ensure that your colors are correct. Yep, it's true. And we're proof...we had the color code (in hex) right on our proof. It was ignored. And when it happened, they effectively said: ""well, we told you so - it's your own fault"".We run a business, and would absolutely never dream of:1) Ignoring the color of the proof that the customer sent.2) Shipping said labels to the customer anyhow, hoping that they don't notice.3) Telling them to pound sand when we're called on to fix the error.We understand making mistakes, but we also expect a legit company to fix those mistakes when they happen. These guys are not legit.Seriously, take your business elsewhere - it's not worth the frustration. Especially after the service experience. Just horrible.We'll likely leave a video review on youtube so you all can see for yourselves.

2141,2,"This label paper will NOT suck up! I used online labels, but I hated that they didn't offer any free shipping no matter how much or little you bought so I went with this company. NEVER AGAIN. They charge the same amount of money, but there is something different about these sheets. I called in and the rep gave me the age-old excuse of so many printers and all that. This brother printer is BRAND NEW. Not 2 weeks old! I've printed so many different kinds of paper in this thing I can't keep up. (I'm a business.) No issues whatsoever until I started messing with THIS company. I am having to manually feed these labels in and even then, the printer keeps reading that the printer is jammed when it is not! I'm so over it. This is my first AND LAST purchase with this company."
2142,3,"After being a customer for over 2 years and spending $1,000's of dollars per year, they refuse to honor their guarantee. Recently I have had an order never arrived that they made me pay for. And another order of labels that don't work in 6 different printers. They also refuse to replace these labels or pay for expedited shipping to get me replacement labels for the ones that do not work. At the end of the day you do not get ""guaranteed results"" or anything from them. Don't order Polyester or weatherproof labels. Also, shipping takes 10 days. All and all, not worth working with them with all the other companies out there that make the exact same products. I called twice to try and let them fix the issue and the support staff was rude and dismissive."
2143,3,"to find out I need to wait another week. Apparently, somewhere in the email, way after the estimated date they add the info that they are backed up. So, you get an email with a subject line ""Your order is being printed"", open it to see that the estimated date to be shipped is within four days (loud and clear), but if you read further, way below, they mention that it also could be delayed by 6 days. IMHO if your competitive edge is a 4-day turnaround, delays need to be communicated BEFORE I place the order. You are obviously aware you are running behind since the ""we are backed up"" message is a part of your automated email notification.I did forego my regular printer who guarantees a 10-day turnaround because I needed it faster. My order was ""printing"" on May 1st, it is May 9th and it hasn't been shipped yet.------The customer success representative reached out and offered an overnight shipment for my order for free. Which is nice of them. As I mentioned on the phone, I'd be happy to remove this review if the company changes the way they communicate about delays. I'm sorry for customer service guys picking up the slack after management."

They refused my request to honor what the advertise, saying the exclusion in fact includes all sealers. I cancelled the order and will never try to buy from them again."
2146,2,Absolutely awful customer service. Purchased bags from that I desperately needed that were suppose to 5x7. It stated on the site that they would ship that day if the order was placed by 2:30 EST which it was and the order still did not go out until the next day. When they finally arrived much to my disappointment they were NOT 5 x 7 and too small for me to use. When I contacted them the SAME day my order arrived (after two emails to get an RA #) they informed me that they would measure the bags when they arrived to see if they were smaller and only if they were would they credit me for the return. I am so tired of paying for defective merchandise and will never work with a company that has zero concept of customer service.
2147,2,I ordered plastic bags from this company for the first time and based my purchase off of the photograph of the bag. Apparently I got the wrong bag because they had the wrong photograph and they made me pay twice and pay shipping to return their bags and pay for their mistake. Won't be doing Buisness with them again.
2148,2,"The item that I received was not as described. I ordered flip top deli bags that were supposed to be made of HDPE. As it turns out they were not 100% HDPE and as such they are of no use to me. I threw the box away when I received the bags, so I can no longer return the item. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, because I tried contacting the company via the contact information provided and was unable to reach them/never received a response. I would not purchase from this company again. Thankfully, I found another online retailer that did have what I needed, and offered awesome customer service. I won't be back to Plastic Bag Partners in the future."
2149,2,Sent five cases of bottles with no caps! Why would anyone buy a bottle that takes a cap but doesn’t come with one with the bottle and it doesn’t tell you that in the literature about the bottle!!! Will buy from a company that sends the caps with the bottles next time!
2150,3,I wish shipping options were more affordable. I only buy lids from Burch now as its the only affordable option with shipping figured in. I am not making this up. I can purchase pint or half pint glass jars from Wal Mart. Pay retail AND sales tax. They are lower priced than I can get your jars. I only have to order by the case not by the thousands. They also ship to my home for free within 2 days. I just can't get over how I can pay retail AND tax and get a better price than a supplier.
2151,3,"The outside box was heavily damaged, but the inside boxes were not damaged. When I first got the box, I thought that I would have to look into a different company. But my product seems to be ok. I'm still a bit wary on ordering from Burch Bottle again, I'll see how it goes."

2153,3,"We ordered 500 x 50ml plastic bottles and matching lids. About 10% of the bottles had obvious defects. Bubbles in the plastic with dirt? mold? inclusions. Note these are not on the outside of the plastic, they are literally baked INSIDE the plastic. On the plus side the price was low, but have a better idea of why now. Quality control is definitely lacking."
2154,3,"The bags are fantastic quality. I have received samples from may other companies, and none compare to the quality. I pay extra because of the exchange rate (in Canada) and it is worth it. Have always had great customer service, and wonder if there's been a change in staff, as I have noticed a drastic decline in that with my most recent purchase. I am hoping that it is just an adjustment period."
2155,3,"I received the wrong pouches and was frustrated the pouches I had ordered were not shipped out as soon as I called in the mistake. They were only shipped out once the carrier had scanned in the return label from the labels I was returning. The pouches I needed were not rush shipped and I was almost in the position of not being able to fill orders, and I was prettyunsatisfied with how it was handled."

I was also given a tracking #, but no carrier details so where should I go to track the package? I paid $7.95 for shipping.... and no indication was given as to how it would be shipped.

After this, I'm happy to pay the higher price and know I'll receive what I'm ordering in a timely matter and have all the tracking info I need and the carrier at the time I place the order.

2160,2,"I was happy to see the variety of items this company offered and the pricing was okay compared to other companies although it depends on what you are looking for. They shipped the order quickly and packed it well, but some of the merchandise had defects or was damaged and when I contacted them they gave me a hard time. I had to send pictures and even after that, they still made it difficult. So much for their ""hassle free"" policy. We are taking about an expensive order and a very small amount that I was dissatisfied with so there was no reason for the ""hassle"". Most companies want to satisfy their customers and apparently they don't care about that. I am thinking about returning my whole order. I don't think I will ever do business with them again."
2161,2,"After ordering shipping tags from fetpack 2 years ago I was finally ready to make another order. I placed the order along with a few more items and was excited to receive my shipment. Ups showed up at my door expecting an additional $26.01 for customs charges and taxes, I was shocked as I have never ordered such large items and didn't not know additional charges would apply but I gladly paid it. Once I opened my order, I found that the shipping tags that came were completely different than the ones I order. I contacted fetpack about the issues, they told me that the boarder costs are not their problem (true) and that the items I purchased stated ""reinforced"" which on the past order meant a plastic strip on the backside and blank front but on this order meant a 1/8"" brown reinforcement hole on both sides of the tag. When questioned further they simply stated ""Not responsible for typographical errors. Artwork is representational.Not responsible for typographical errors. Artwork is representational."" but that I was welcome to send my item back for a refund and provided a #. Shipping this back would cost more than the item itself! Completely unreasonable response and I will not deal with fetpack again."
2162,2,I ordered two of the large Aluminum jewelry carrying cases and because Fetpak sent my order out in two separate boxes I was charged Brokerage fees from your courier UPS on both- so for my order which was a little over $200.00 I paid Duty and Brokerage fees of over $123.00. (The duty I expect but the rest was not). I will certainly think twice about placing an order with you again. (And this is not to mention only one of the aluminum cases had keys and two of the ring displays were already broken in the packaging). Very disappointed!
2163,2,"I rate my customer service experience with you all a 1, and that's being generous, as i placed my order on Wednesday, February 4th and was disgusted to find out that, even though you all had received the money for my purchase already, my purchase wasn't shipped out until the following Monday or Tuesday which is quite unacceptable! I don't know what happened but i'm not sure if i will ever order from you ever again because the two times i contacted your customer service rep, she didn't seem to understand or have knowledge of why this occurred. It's definitely not a way to do business, which seriously hindered mine!"
2164,3,"Be Cautious if you have a time sensitive order. No tracking # provided in any of the three emails received from the bottlestore.com. Went to my order page and still no tracking # or shipment info other than an ""Estimated delivery by UPS on....."" - simply not enough info for e-commerce in 2019. Even a $29 a month shopify site will send customers UPS tracking numbers."
2165,3,"My package was pushed nearly 2 weeks behind, with me constantly having to push forward my emails to an employee who wouldn't respond or be extremely vague as to where my package was, and why it was so late. I couldn't even get tracking on it properly.

2166,3,I am so upset over my purchase. I ordered a sample of the bottles before hand and what I got was nothing like the bottles I ordered a sample of. The bottles I have look like they have been made from a top and a bottom. I had one explode after having liquid in them for 22 hours. I am hoping for a refund. These are horrible.
2167,2,My order was projected to arrive a week ago. When i emailed to ask why it had not arrived i was told it was not shipped yet. It is now a week later and i still have not received my item. I have already paid for this nor received an invoice or updated shipping information. The customer service number i was given was disconnected. I am now losing money because of how unreliable this company is and there is very little customer service. Very disappointed and will most definitely be finding somewhere else to buy my products from.
2168,3,"This site provides absolutely no response to email inquiries and does not have a phone number for customer service. I ordered samples in addition to ordering bottles - the samples never came, nor did any email to let me know of their whereabouts. These were required for artwork adaptation and this lack of responsiveness forced delays."
2169,2,"I wish that I could give this review 0 stars. It took a week for me to receive bottles. One whole week. Might I add that I live in Jersey & everything left from warehouses in NH. I received the caps/lids two days after placing the order. I called GS two days after receiving the caps to find out what was going on w/ the actual bottles. I was pretty much told that there was a glitch or some kind of error where only half of the order was processed. I explained to a woman named Colleen, who was very rude, that this was unacceptable & that I needed the bottles for an event on Monday. She told me that she would give me a call back after speaking w/ her manager. So, an hour plus passes by & Colleen calls back & apologizes about the time that it took to call back. She goes on to say that the bottles were sent out & that I’ll have them on Monday. I again explained that it was unacceptable! She gave me a very weak apology, but to add fuel to the fire she offered to wave the shipping cost. Are you freaking kidding me??? I’m still baffled as to why the bottles weren’t overnighted. Especially after being told that the bottles were needed for Monday. Overnighting them that Friday would’ve ensured that I had them in time for Monday morning. Good Start completely bombed my order! I guess it’s safe to say Good Start isn’t so good after all. I will never ever purchase anything from you guys again & I’ll make sure to advise family, friends, colleagues & anyone else that mentions Good Start. Signed, A Very Disappointed Customer."
2170,2,"Unacceptable Experience! I received four different shipments from different couriers for my entire order. For the final product of my shipment I was never notified that it would not ship weeks later. I had to contact the company for them to advise that it was not in their inventory (then realizing they drop ship and are a third party company that does not house the product sold). I was not offered an apology just a statement stating that “this sometimes happens, but rarely and it just so happen to occur with your order”That statement was poor customer service when you provide a 1-2 day shipping service and haven’t sent a notification indicating that an item would be delayed.I will not be purchasing from this company again.

2171,2,"I ordered bowls now for almost 3 weeks. No one told me they were out of stock. I am still waiting on my product.Will find another company to do business with, that will put out of stock button so I can decide if I want to wait 4 weeks or not.If I did not need these I would not have ordered them."
2172,3,"I placed an order 11 days ago. The description says it usually ships in 1-2 days, there has been no update on my order since I placed it. I need the item within the next 10 days for a wedding I am catering. Tried calling customer service today (Saturday) guess they don’t work weekends but you better believe ther will be receiving a call on Monday, I only hope they have acceptable answers and that I receive my order in time."
2173,1,Poor response time and follow up. My timeline was lost due to lack of basic call back. I’m amaze at how companies are not eager to make a new client feel welcome and invited to do business. I guess they are not prepare for customer service interactions. I will not not recommend them for business.
2174,3,"I ordered with papermart and waited for my items to arrive. I received an email saying that my package had arrived only to find it was not on my doorstep nor in my mailbox. After multiple times speaking with the postmaster and independently knocking on multiple neighbor's doors, my package was still nowhere to be found despite efforts to track it with the tracking number. Finally as a last resort I called Papermart directly. The rep was of no help and the only advice that I was given was to contact the police or make another order with them. If I did not receive the first package why on Earth would I order more? I was told despite paying so much for shipping that my package was completely uninsured and that I would not be receiving my merchandise NOR my money back. Finally, I went back to the website and hit the contact button and left detailed feedback TWICE. Still haven't gotten so much as a response. Worst online shopping experience ever! The allure of beautiful products with a decent price isn't worth it if you never get them."
2175,3,"I originally ordered bags from Paper Mart in 2006. Since I am in Australia, and Paper Mart doesnt send internationally, I sent the bags to a contact in WA to forward to me. Since we were going to be in WA in August, 2018 it was a prime opportunity to purchase a larger order of bags from Paper Mart and bring them back with me at that time.In November 2018, I contacted Paper Mart about my order. As stated at that time, I had not had the opportunity of going through the bags earlier (they were ordered in July) due to some personal issues and only had enough time to count the bags to make sure all was correct. During this, I found some of the Rose coloured bags that were so absolutely terrible, I contacted Paper Mart about those and some missing bags. They refunded me the $5 or so for those bags.Unfortunately, I had been unable to go through the bags fully and repackage them for resale, due to my partner’s ongoing medical issues. I sell the bags in packs of 4, primarily as bags that people can craft with, so they need to be of good quality. I went through all the bags, and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. So I contacted Paper Mart TWICE saying essentially what is in this review (including photos of the issues) with no response! no customer service, no trying to make things right. In 2006 the bags were PERFECT. The cutting, stitching and quality was PERFECT. The seams were PERFECT! They were crisp, rightly sized and perfectly shaped. I could just take the bags from them and repackage and away they go. I had absolutely NO losses. The only bags that I could do that with now are the Hearts and Swirls (only losing 3 due to some dark pink being in the wrong spot) and the Daisy ones (only losing 2 due to dark pink ink on the daisy petals). I put the bags aside that were questionable which was very near all of them, revisiting them 2 more times to make sure I wasn’t being picky…I WASN’T. I spent over 3 hours cutting threads off them, over 2 hours ironing some of them to see if I could match up the seams properly with limited results. It’s just a shame I can’t attach photos on this review as you would be as appalled as I am. The following are some of the problems:1. Dirt and marks on the bags2. Seams coming apart3. Stitching coming apart4. Not even rectangle5. Sizing different (some up to ¼ inch which on this size bag is noticeable6. Stitching not straight7. Corners square on one side and rounded on the other8. Flimsy organza (a huge variation on the quality in the same pack)9. Twisted ribbon so bad I cant fixI do understand that Paper Mart are unable to check every one (and going on what I received they haven’t checked any) however I have to, as I package in smaller quantities, and just starting to increase my sales makes it even more important. The quality was so good back then that ordered again, thinking that was normal. Now I know it wasn’t. If I had received these back in 2006, I would not have ordered from Paper Mart again. I paid AUD$309.91 for these bags (1560 of them). When I went through them there are 328 bags that I definitely couldn’t use which in itself if over 21% failure rate. In addition there are further Rose bags I can’t use, the Ivory, Light Pink, Silver and Toffee are almost write offs (which is 540 bags), and the rest are questionable except the Lime which appears to be the only really successful colour. So all in all I have about 360 bags out of 1560 that I could actually feel good about onselling. Honestly knowing what I feel receiving them, I can imagine what my customers would feel like receiving them. As it had been over 30 days when I checked them, and due to being in Australia it would be not very cost effective to return them anyway.It may be an issue with their supplier, but it's ultimately Paper Mart's responsibility to stand behind what they are selling. I have essentially handed over a lot of money and nothing much to show for it. It has bought my sales of this product to a standstill and impacted my ability to bring in extra money for my family. Thanks for that!""

2176,3,"I dont usually write bad reviews, but after dealing with Papermart i had to just state my case. I find it insane how within minutes the order is placed, after noticing an address was wrong i called as soon as they opened (seeing as i placed the order the night before) and they told me that fedex has not picked up the package but its already on the truck and it would be too much of a hard work to get the box and then change the address. Mind you fedex did not come by til the day after. On top of that, the colors did not match remotely close to what was on the screen. so as soon as i received it i over nighted it back to the store where it was SIGNED AND RECEIVED BY someone in their warehouse, almost a week later and my return is still ""processing""They are quick to take the money but not quick to actually give it back."
2177,2,"I placed my order for what is described on Papermart's website as ""white premium two piece heavy gift boxes with lid. I didn't notice that further down the page I had to order the lids separately, so when I received the boxes, I thought something was missing. So I called and was then told I had to order the lids, and I did so. Aside from the way they have described your product which is TOTALLY MISLEADING, there was nothing ""premium"" about the box part. It was flimsy and cheap and was not of the same quality as the lid. My friends commented that the lids did not appear to be the same lid that should go with the box and also made comments about how the boxes were not sturdy at all. I am at a loss as to why any company would sell lids to boxes separately except that it makes them look less expensive. I will not anything from Papermart again."
2178,2,"We ordered some items essential for our business Nov 26th, by Dec 7th we still didn't have the items. We called and they offered to reship the items but we would need to pay the overnight shipping charges. We had to have the items or we would lose money. Long miserable story they charged us for the total cost of the items and the overnight shipping. Then the original order arrives extremely late and now they want us to pay them more! When we have paid for the original order, paid for the replacement order and we have proof of all their e-mails and the charges to our bank account. This has been the worst customer service we have ever experienced. We will find a new supplier so we never have to deal with them again.

2179,1,"I placed a small order with ebottles.com and it will be the last time that I will ever do business with them. They split my order and shipped it out about a week apart even though the company guarantees same day shipping if you order by 12 pm est. When I called customer service, they verbally apologized and told me that it was harder to put together my smaller order than any normal larger order. I will not ever be ordering from this company again and I will strongly advise anyone and everyone to not even attempt to do business with ebottles.com."
2180,3,"I have had several phone conversations with customer service. I was told the bottles would be available 11-11-14. I have talked with customer service on 11-11-14, 12th and the 13th. All three days I was told the bottles are now in stock. I've asked for tracking info and they could not give it to me. It is now th 16th and no tracking or bottles. Payment has been made and cashed without receipt of bottles and tracking info. No follow through for cust service to shipping."
2181,3,Customer service was not that friendly. The online site did not record my order due to a malfunction in the system so I had to re-order by phone and the person I spoke to sounded like they were having a bad day. It's good that the product delivery is timely or my rating would have been lower.
2182,2,"Not only are the items overpriced, the shipping is absurd. I pay cheaper shipping to ship the bottles out internationally, and filled with liquid! Then if you need to make a return, you have to call that shipping cost a loss plus the shipping to send it back and then minus another 25% restocking fee on top of that! $125 to put some lids back in the warehouse stock!? I did order a few thousand units from them until I realized how badly I was being shafted by their service. I understand business is business and I would not be so upset if I would not be losing over 50% of my money on a $500 order just to return an item especially after spending thousands with the company. No thanks, ebottles has lost my business."
2183,1,"This company cost me money, bottom line. I ordered from them, received the wrong order and half of the glass I received was broken. They reshipped and i received more broken glass. Then droppers I received were defective and after 3 uses would not reseal. They shipped me new ones and they were the wrong size for the bottles. After that they reshipped me new droppers and finally I had my full order 3 months later. I called in and spoke with the owner he was rude and his customer service was terrible, I was upset and he refused to give me a refund after he cost me accounts due to the faulty tops. In the end he hung up on me. WOW I warn you now don't do use this company.

You'll order, get an email days later saying they are processing within 3-5 days. Which ends up being more like 6-7 if you're lucky.Oh, and they stopped answering emails and taking phone calls apparently. Worst company to deal with ever.Edit: Havent answered emails in at least 10 days regarding my order. I luckily was able to cancel it even though I needed the supplies for my business. I ended up getting them from a company that actually responds and ships out orders. Edit 2: They flagged my last review because they didn't believe I am a real customer.

2186,1,Worst customer service you'll ever receive. That is if you actually get someone to reply to you. I'm a full time maker of bath and body products and have been a customer for 6 years. I've had enough. You might wait 6 weeks to get something sent to you and not be able to even ask about it while you wait. And they won't tell you it's on backorder before you order. And if you get someone to reply to you they might have the worst attitude you've ever encountered and might also make up a date when your order will ship (it won't ship that day or even close to it). Summary: Even if someone else charges more it's worth it to avoid the headache of this company. I'll be browsing through these reviews to see where else I can order. Thanks to those who were kind enough to share the names of other manufacturers.

Normally five stars but this has been a terrible experienceNo we did not get a response. We do not have a junk mailbox, I also called and left several messages. You all just dropped the ball and it would be nice to own up to that instead of acting as if we are in the wrong. We spend good deal of capital with you all.... EVERY MONTH... It would be nice to get the apology without the back door being left open as if we did not see the response.

Ordered a part with expedited shipping for a customer visit; part wasn't shipped until after we asked for tracking the day before it was supposed to arrive (and we were lied to and told it had shipped already), and to top it off, they then shipped the part ground, rendering the whole exercise useless since it was a week late by the time it arrived. Dishonest or clueless customer service the whole time we were trying to figure out where our product was. Won't be ordering from this company ever again."

I was rushed off the phone so fast I can believe it. Well, that never happened. Here it is 7 day after I made my order and called in. More delays supposedly it will ship today. IT has been over 7 days no calls, email, or any information about my order. So I requested a discount off my next order because I was willing to forgive and forget. I was offered the same coupon in the Facebook group. My business means nothing and I will be choosing another service. Horrible service, I will be informing the groups I am apart of about my experience. Update: After I tried to leave my review on facebook they removed it.

We made 2 orders on the same day. 1. reorder 100 bubble mailer and 2.order 200 larger poly mailers. The company gave both orders the same tracking number. They did not ship the bubble mailers. The box we received had 500 poly bag that were smaller and cheaper than what we ordered and only a few poly bags the correct size at the top. They sent us a Paypal bill for receiving extra poly mailers and refused to mail the bubble mailers that were not shipped. They tried to force us to pay for envelopes we did not order. They refused to send a return shipping label for us to return the small poly envelopes that were received in error. They accused us of trying to send them envelopes from another company. The box clearly has the quantity of bags, size of bags and their website address on the outside. If you cannot find what you need and feel like you have to play Russian roulette with this company, do it on Amazon where you can get your money back without having to wait a long time or go through tremendous hassle if they make a mistake with your order."

2199,1,"I'll try to be as objective as possible and describe my experience so you can draw your own conclusions. I received about a 1300$ quote which seemed too good to be true (it was). Anyway, I set up my pickup date in Bloomington, IN for June 16/17. The drivers were a day late on June 18th and arrived at night. Overall not a huge deal but I had to initiate communication with the company to get answers which was aggravating. It wouldn't have been a huge deal with better communication. Anyway, when the foreman assessed my furniture the quote changed to 2300$. I'm going to assume that however this company does quotes is inaccurate because the amount of stuff I had matched closely with what I provided them in advance. At that point I had no choice but to accept and honestly, not a huge deal but kind of annoying. I will say that the movers did a great job wrapping my stuff up carefully so I'll give them a thumbs up on this specific aspect of the move. The real nightmare began soon thereafter. Since I didn't know my destination address in Austin, TX (I was driving down to select an apartment) I had to fill out a Destination Form (something like that) when I got my apartment which was the 24th of June. I was informed I needed to send it again the 27th. Form sent. Now the real nightmare begins. I wait and wait and wait with absolutely no information at all about when my household goods are going to arrive. I GUESS they guarantee it within 21 business days (I may have had a huge oversight at some point) but I distinctly remember thinking it was 3-10 business days when I paid the deposit. Maybe I missed some fine print that doesn't exist somewhere. Anyway I wait with intermittent communications with the company trying to get an idea of when my stuff will arrive. We come up on July 11th when I have to leave for 2 weeks for work. They won't be there by then so I assume I'll be able to get it immediately when I'm back. I return and can't even get in to contact with the dispatcher (I think?). Repeated calls and texts aren't responded to and I finally send an angry email to the company which yielded at least a call from the dispatcher. This goes on for almost three weeks with vague, nonsensical updates. I'm convinced my stuff is either lost or stolen at this point. I was wrestling with these guys for three weeks and alas, the stuff FINALLY arrives on August 11th. There were some obnoxious add-on charges like this BS 'elevator fee' and 'long carry' fee (which were actually on the Delivery Form I signed AFTER my stuff was picked up so I have no choice) which added about 400$ I needed to pay the guy before they offloaded my stuff. On the plus side, nothing was missing or damaged so I guess that's an extremely thin silver lining. Overall I think the major issue for me was communication. Trying to get anything from these guys was impossible and stressful. You're in the dark about your stuff and this operation doesn't seem legitimate at all. Just look at the website, it looks like a child made it (shame on me for somehow getting blinded by the amazing initial quote). I would recommend selecting a national carrier with a strong reputation. You get what you pay for and I learned this the hard way. I would not recommend this company to anyone (well, maybe somebody I didn't like). I was in the military for 4+ years and they were able to move my stuff from Korea to upstate NY in exponentially less time than this company AND they provided me a delivery window that they stuck to. Just avoid this company, please."
2200,3,"The reason we are giving one is as we cant give it in a negative or minus star.Let me tell you that this was the most frustrating move I had so far as I keep moving almost every 6 months or a year. 1. At the time of booking, they told that they can hold luggage for 30 days whereas Jeremy from Metro relocation threatened me that If i don't take delivery by 7/7, they will not deliver anything in future and he was shouting that storage is not free and he charged me $300 extra and he said that he will not deliver if i don't pay this additional amount. So this entire move costed me 2246 whereas quote was 1946. 2. The pick up guys didn't pack anything and they used the same boxes which we prepared with intention of helping them to make it faster. They just packed as it's without proper fulling the box and whey they are about to move 20 boxes, they said they can't accommodate anything more which is really surprising. As you remember, we discussed during the booking that they can adjust 5-10 more boxes as we can't give exact estimate during placing the order. As a result, I had a lot of stuff which I had to dispose off. They told me they wont even take lamps as they were not mentioned in the list. Do i need to inform you about 2000 plus items i own ? Is not that common sense?3. It was subcontracted to some Metro relocation and they are so arrogant, stubborn and impolite to talk to the customer. As per this quote, i was given two days as move-date out of which second day was for buffer for move however I was not informed until Saturday 06/30 that they will move on 2nd day (2nd July). When the lady contacted me on that fateful Saturday, she told that they wont be coming before afternoon on Monday. When I expressed my concern that its late she said that is when they are coming , do you want me to cancel your order ( the tone was of a threat)? That was the start of the constant harassment of us as customers.And on 2nd July, They told that they can come after only late evening so its better let them come on Tuesday. We told that we can not delay the move after two days delay so they turned up at 8:30 pm which is quite late. 4. They did not wrapped the glass items and just dumped the stuff like a novice. So that they could charge more money by adding boxes but as they came late at night and were in a hurry to leave they just were not even ready to pick the entire stuff although we told them we will pay extra. This whole move was a harassment we were charged, overcharged, threatened, rudely dealt with at every step.They kept our stuff as a ransom and threatened if we do not get the delivery the time and day of their choice(although the contract had 30 days free storage) and threatened we might have to pick the stuff from Atlanta if we do not take it on Saturday. When we finally arranged they did not even bothered to call us( although was trying to reach them and told them just give us a call when you are 30 min away. Is that asking too much? As they wanted to put waiting charged as well. Looks like robbers and thugs are running this business. They charged us $300 for keeping the stuff for three days although they had in the contract that we can store for 30 days.5. They came to deliver the stuff also at night and when we told that one entire box is missing they said we need to talk to metro relocation which again have subcontracted to some random guys and the truck on which they came didn't belonged to metro. So my stuff changed hands thrice.

Amazingly enough when they were trying to get my business they wouldnt stop calling and once they got it I cant get a return phone call. Was promised (lied to) that it would be 7-10 days at most. I've tried calling their customer service that is supposedly 24/7 and get a voicemail message with the following sorry mailbox is full. I also have called numerous times their ""direct line"" also without a call back. Finally talked to Cynthia again this week after she promised that she would contact me as soon as my things were loaded on the truck. I called her (during business hours) to find out that it was in transit but and she apologized again very sincerely (lol) saying that she had just been notified and would file another ""complaint"" because it was unacceptable like she was actually concerned. So after being told that it was in transit and it would be friday or saturday or sunday they just werent sure when they would get to it the driver calls me at 630pm on Friday to let me know there is going to be another $350 charge because they can't pull the semi into the apartment complex and they are going to have to use a shuttle service. Not the drivers fault not blaming him at all but he still cant tell me when he will be here maybe tomorrow maybe sunday. But now that he cant drive the semi and trailer in here if I were to use the shuttle service he has no idea how soon I will get my things. DO NOT USE THEM! Again the guy Ron Ross that I talked to in the beginning of this nightmare was Johnny on the spot up until the contract was signed. Now again I sit here on Friday knowing that Cynthia wont be back in until Monday to return a phone call (I only know this because she informed me she doesnt work weekends and if she takes a day off no one answers her phone or returns calls) 24/7 customer service what a joke. I've called Ron, Cynthia, Customer service and the driver. Still no answers or calls back. I can't stress enough about not using them. The driver who called said he would contact dispatch and have them contact me but then he called back and said they would tomorrow. I am not paying them another penny. I will have them unload it on the street! Really wish I would have seen honest reviews before using them. And now as I go to post this I see other bad reviews with replys from their customer service they must be too busy surfing the net to answer the phone. But they have the apology down to a tee! And they can save their time replying to this one because it will fall on deaf ears."
2202,1,"The estimated price they give you is not worth your items being lost, broken, and delivered almost 6 weeks after booking. I was charged an extra $700 (I only have a very small one-bedroom apartment full of goods) on top of the $1700 quote AFTER my goods had already been loaded up into the truck at pickup. I was never notified of the extra charges by the broker or the trucking company (was only told by my family who helped at pickup location). The customer service was rude and lacked any empathy when it came to discussing the move and services. I called multiple times, weekly, to check and see where my items were and when to expect delivery but was told every time that, ""my items had legally 21 business days to be delivered and they didn't know exact location of my items"". My couch is completely ruined, my dining room chairs and table are extremely scratched and scuffed, as well as miscellaneous items, such as photo frames and glasses, are all broken. When I asked the drivers about missing items at delivery, they told me that the items ""weren't in the truck so had to have been in one of the boxes then"" (which they were not). Upon delivery, one of the truck drivers even admitted that they would never have their belongings moved this way. I tried submitting a claim for the lost and damaged items but had to pay another $50 to submit the claim and was not guaranteed any sort of refund. I tried multiple avenues to contact a manager and was ignored and never acknowledged. I strongly advise against using this company!!

2203,1,"NEVER USE THIS MOVING COMPANY!! They are HORRIBLE!! From the sales people, to the managers, to their “Customer Service”!! I had Ana as a sales person, and I told her I was in a tight budget so she gave me a low ball quote with a “300” discount. Little did I know, two days before the move I was told that I need a shuttle on both sides as well as pay for an elevator fee and additional fuel charges that were not charged up front. I never signed my contract, and when I tried to cancel to get my deposit back I was not given my deposit back! They steal your money. Their managers, Kim, Jennifer and Tammy was worst of all, did nothing to help. Someone from their customer service department called me and hung up on me!! Why is that person on your customer service team!!? BEWARE OF THEIR ADDITIONAL COSTS AND RIDICULOUS FEES!! They’re all LIARS AND TAKE YOUR MONEY!!"
2204,3,"Poor service for a nice product. One item arrived ok. Second item still has not shown up. Reportedly damaged in shipping and returned to sender. Inadequately wrapped in poly for shipping. Expected a quick fix, but still waiting way too long."
2205,1,Horrible experience. Ordered 2 mats for a client. Never received shipping information and was informed by the client they received 1 mat. My husband also ordered a mat as a holiday gift and Fedex lost his order. When the mat arrived it was only wrapped in a plastic bag which was ripped and the mat was wet. Do not waste your time.
2206,3,I tried to order the rug 5 times and it never showed up in my cart. I tried on two different browsers - Chrome and Safari and the item never showed up in the cart. I shut off my computer and then came back to it an hour later and tried to order it again and this time there were 5 rugs in my cart.
2207,3,"I ordered one large scraper mat and two small indoor doormats with my company logo on them. When I received the email of proofs for printing- with a phone number asking me to call about color matching. I called and made a couple corrections (just solid black behind our logo on the scraper mat, and to resize the logo and darken the gray on the smaller mats). She said I could look up the Pantone colors for exact matching on the scraper mat but that I'd have to trust her about using the darkest charcoal gray they had for the smaller mats. She sent back an email with the new proofs where the scraper mat was all black with our logo, but the smaller mat design hadn't changed. So when I questioned it she said they'd use the darkest gray. I neglected to ask about the resizing when I approved the mat regrettably ""trusting"" they'd be darker with the logo smaller. When the scraper mat came and still had a large gray border (which incidentally wasn't set evenly) and the still too big logo on the smaller mats are barely visible in the too light gray background. Obviously the wrong order was sent to the plant. When I emailed her as such she said the plant needed proof. I sent her pictures, and she emailed back they'd replace the scraper mat with the approved one but that I had the assume responsibility for the smaller mats as I'd approved them after all. I protested, but she sent me a picture of the two different dark grays they use -one of them mine and how they weren't very different after all. (Had I known that I wouldn't have made them with either color gray). I get it guess, but it is poor business practice. Or customer service. I'm still waiting to receive the approved scraper mat, to have at least part of what I ordered useable. I like the scraper mat quality though and am looking forward to the new one hopefully centered and borderless.

2208,3,"I placed the order with just enough time to meet a deadline. I realized too late that I had not seen a promised proof from them. I contacted them. They said they sent a proof for my approval. But looking back through all my email I could not find one. They then sent a proof upon my inquiry which had no problem arriving in my email. They then told me I would have to pay a rush charge of $150 (mind you, the order itself was only $160) in order to get it in time. If they had sent the proof and I had overlooked it I would understand it was my fault but truly believe they did not even send the proof. I diligently looked for an email sent after the order confirmation email and there was nothing to be found. But they had me in a bind for the deadline and I needed to have them in place so I agreed to the rush fee. Just disappointed to be paying rush shipping fee (doubling my purchase price) at their mistake. Someone there dropped the ball. :( Products are nice. Logo prints look good. And seem to be wearing fine in industrial and office settings.

2209,3,"Cost of pen refill, $6, was just too high, and was not very high quality, as I learned in using it. Then cost of mailing one refill, $3, was unreasonable. Later I found refill for ""legal - lawyer"" grade refill that fit my custom made pen given to me on Fathers Day many years ago for $12.50 for 12 with free shipping, which worked much better. Will just chalk this up as learning experience, with lesson being if I don't find what I am looking for, just keep looking!"
2210,2,I ordered 50 pen refills. At time of order it did not say out of stock. I paid for 3 day shipping because I needed them in a timely manner and I received 2 refills with a letter saying that the other 48 would be sent when you had them. No specific date. It was terrible. I would have ordered from another source if I knew there was a chance I wouldn’t receive my order when I needed it.
2211,1,"My order ( placed on 27 April 2018 ) was slow so, on 7 May 2018, I called to cancel. I actually bought another pen locally. I received a nice email reply indicating that my order was cancelled and my visa card credited. Only my visa card was never credited!!!! Today, 31 May 2018, I called VISA to make sure I hadn't misinterpreted my charges/credits. I had not misunderstood the facts. They had not applied for a credit to my account. I was furious and when I spoke with Cheryl their Accounting Person, she took all the credit for tracking down the situation. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS .... SHE DIDN'T DO ANY TRACKING UNTIL I CALLED TO REQUEST MORE INFORMATION. Cheryl acted like I was ganging up on her when in reality ..... if she truly did work in accounting, she would have recognized her OUT OF BALANCE situation long before today. Very unhappy with this Company and I have shared my concerns with VISA as well.

2212,3,Order was delayed in being fulfilled and shipped. Order was incorrectly engraved and the “free refills” that they said they were including to make up for the delay in shipping were not included. Called their customer service number and was asked to ship back the order and send a copy of their email about the free refills. Very disappointed in the whole experience with this company.
2213,3,This has been my worst experience ever with your company and my order is still not completed and very little or no updates have been provided. I also found the refills you have back ordered on Amazon and received them within two days at or below your cost. One of your folks blamed all of this on a new system but no one offered any resolutions or suggestions...after 20 years of buying from you I can see where my value as a customer is not what o would have hoped for in terms of service and satisfaction. I am not inflating any of remarks as it is now March 1 and I ordered pen refills on February 5 and unless I call have no idea about the status of my remaining items! Your company does not deserve a single star for this performance. Terrible!
2214,1,"Don't bother ordering equipment. I have always had good luck ordering ID badge cards, foils and other consumables. However I will NEVER order another printer from this company. The service is the worst I have ever had. They don't send you a comparable loaner to the machine you have when you need repairs and then the machine they do send seems to be the lowest grade machine I think they sell and it doesn't even have 1/10th of the options I currently have. I have been waiting 2 weeks to get the a good loaner so I can send my machine back that needs repair. My customers are getting upset and the jobs keep piling up as we wait. When ordering the machine it took them months to get us the part for magnetic badge printing and then when it did come it they simply sent it to me to install instead of installing it themselves like I was told was going to happen when the machine was purchased. WORST customer service I have ever had."
2215,3,I trusted the salesman to recommend the best printer which would help to correct problems that we were having with first printer purchased from this company 4 years ago. The printer that he recommended does not put out same quality when asked if it could be returned or exchanged he told me NO. At no time was I ever told that there is a no return or exchange policy. Our company spent over $6000 with the printer and supplies for nothing. We are currently looking into our options with reporting this company. No one has that kind of money to waste. Company does not even deserve a star. Sales representative was stern and to the point. No reasoning at allThe response from ID Maker has incorrect statements and did not discuss their return policy. The sales representative sent me a copy of the return policy. Why would he send the policy if we had not discussed returning or exchanging the item. I am very disappointed in this company and their services. Stay Away from Zach and this Company. They are not customer oriented. Zach even told me not to contact him but call technical support. What sales representative would do that to a customer who had just spent $6000 on a sale.
2216,3,"After a poor review, I left last month ID Wholesaler responded that ""in consideration of your inconvenience, your Account Manager will be reaching out to you with a special offer."" Alas that was February and now it is March (the order was placed in January). The over $10,000 we spent on the printer and supplies was a complete waste. We missed the printing deadline and had to outsource the work. We have not received any offers of assistance from ID Wholesaler. Worst online buying experience I have ever had over."
2217,3,I was told product will arrive within a week and so I confirmed the order. I followed up in a week and was told product is out of stock and cannot be shipped until 2 more week. Not acceptable. Should have informed me when the product availability changed.
2218,3,"I called to order more key cards was told this business was sold but will honor the last price I paid with last ordered, that was good!I also said I need them asap ....well three weeks plus later no key cards? 3-5 days days is amazing but 3-5 WEEKS not so good. Not getting them at all, what is going on?"
2219,1,"Ordered a product and the company said it has been sent but never sent me the requested tracking number. after 5 days days nothing received. So the company is cheating and not sending the payed product. filing now a fraud case with my credit card bank to get my money back. I can't recommend this company. very bad service.

2220,3,"No email confirmation after placing order. Only part of the order was delivered. Called customer service hundred times and only one time there was actual person speaking to you, and did not solve the problem at all. He said the manager is going to call back or send an email, but no, nothing. Placed the order on March 5th, and today is 14th, did not get any email or call explaining about our missing delivery."
2221,1,"No one can tell you anything about the product. The mysterious ""Randy"" never calls back. Emails bounce back. There's no customer service. The website hasn't been updated, links don't work. Website is also unclear, Am I purchasing a cd or a download? Seems like its a cd, they charge shipping but when you call they said I will receive a link. Where's the instructions? When you call the main line they can't put you in touch with anyone that can help. They can't answer questions and just give you a number for some guy named Randy. Very poor service. Probably a scam. I'm ready to cancel my order."
2222,2,"Employee of Blumberg contacted us following our custom order and was very rude concerning how we ordered the product (we used the website and reordered a custom cover that we've ordered for multiple years. He was upset that we didn't fax over the reorder form that was in the package because apparently that reorder form is different than the reorder option on Blumberg's website. He was rude enough that our firm will be using another company for the few legal supplies that we purchase through Blumberg Excelsior, Inc. (we find them to be expensive and other options are out there where the same or similar products can be had for less money). The employee could certainly learn a lesson in customer service and how to speak with and to the people who place orders! I will happily send the business to a local company who doesn't get upset with the customer for processing an order on the Web versus fax!"
2223,3,"I had to call three times before I was even able to get through and speak with someone. The first time the line rang for at least 3 minutes straight with no answer. The second time I was transferred without being told where to or the reason. The third time I finally spoke with someone and they were not helpful at all and referred me to write an email to get help. Bad customer service, bad communication skills. Bad experience."
2224,3,It took several weeks to receive my product and I asked for the words to be correctly sentenced since the app kept moving it once I placed it. Support was no help when I asked for some sort of refund. Terrible customer service.
2225,3,"Unacceptable. I received my order (order P2240273) for return address labels for our 501(c)(3) nonprofit. The right margin was wide and the address was running off each label on the left. I called them on 12/06, the following morning when they opened and they apologized and said they would print new ones and overnight mail them to me. Nine days later, they still have not arrived. When I called them on 12/14, they said they hadn't printed because they have so many orders for Christmas. So even though they ruined my labels, they aren't taking responsibility. These are for our end-of-year newsletter."
2226,3,"I re-ordered business cards for my business, as I've done before, and when the cards came in the font was so small that I could barely see it. I contacted them via chat and was told that I would have to call customer service, because ""she could not handle that problem' for me. I attempted many times to call the company, but was disconnected several times. Looks like I'm out $29.95.... Very disappointed !!"
2227,3,"Arrived fast, but wrong. My business cards arrived quickly, but there was a major error on them: a duplicate of my logo showed up. I did work through your customer service and was really pleased that there was no trouble getting new ones printed. I haven't received those yet, however. Once I do, I'm happy to update my rating."
2228,1,"I just received my business cards and they are the poorest quality I have ever seen. The print is very poor quality, the edges of the cards are dinged, and the print is not centered/cards are trimmed incorrectly - you can see the border that is supposed to be trimmed! There is no way I can give these to my clients. The quality is embarrassing. I will never use this company again and will certainly be dissuading others from using them as well. If I could rate this as zero stars, I would."
2229,3,"I purchased the customized pillow cases from Inkgarden. To be honest, I chose a very dark colored picture for my pillow case. The problem I have is when I customized it on their website, it didn't show that dark. I would have hoped that someone at Inkgarden would have noticed how it printed and contacted me to discuss. I certainly wouldn't have selected that photo."
2230,1,"By far, the worst experience dealing with a Promo company I've ever had! This company is unorganized, unprofessional & the product they sent to my company was completely Unacceptable! Once I contacted them explaining the issue, they gave me the runaround and sent me to department to department to voice mail to incompetent supervisors. Find a different company now!! You'll be happy you avoided them! If I could give 0 Stars, I would! (They actually deserve Negative Stars) STAY AWAY FROM INKGARDEN!!!"
2231,2,From this company I had ordered something and purchesed 2 day shipping. I had ordered it on the 12th of Feb. It did not get here till 18th. Then I email them about the problem. then when they email back they make the rudest excuse about it and blamed it on me! And not to mention the item I had ordered was BROKEN! I hope every one of you people at ink garden reads this review. will never use this place again!
2232,3,"I contacted inkgarden prior to placing the order to have them review the art files. They felt the files were properly prepared. I then ordered the cups. The finished product is:1. printed off center for the first three cups, and2. blurry for the 4th through 24th cup.I do not believe I can use the blurry cups and do not relish the thought of destroying 21 mugs."
2233,3,I used an image I've had things made with before from other companies.. this time the image was blurry and unrecognizable. .if I would have seen a preview I would not have ordered but you don't find out till it shows up on your doorstep...the coffee mug itself it nice quality..
2234,2,"Our office ordered some tabs, however it was not explicitly written that we would have to pay 40 dollars in brokerage fees for shipping. I attempted to return the tabs for a refund, however I was told that we had no choice but to accept the UPS shipment and pay the fees, otherwise we would not be issued a refund for the items at all. Due to the fact we did not want to pay for return shipping as well, we accepted the shipment and kept the tabs. I was told due to the miscommunication we would receive a discount code for our next order. However, we received no emails and I received no response to my email thereafter. Due to the rude nature of the customer service representative, our office will not be ordering from this company again."
2235,2,"I paid way too much for CD binders from Bindertek. I should have done my research, because I can get a LOT better value for a LOT less...and that's without the extra (massive) duty I had to pay because I live in Canada. One binder (out of 3) shipped broken, and I was able to get it replaced after paying to ship back the broken one as well as shipping for the new one, and customer service was very rude on the phone. Never buying from here again. By the way, the binders are pretty but very bulky, and the main reason I needed them is to get rid of bulk. If you don't need it to look pretty and fancy, get a big zip binder which holds 8 CDs per sheet, unlike this one which holds only one CD per sheet."
2236,2,"I purchased a 5-tier binder carousel. After paying over $1,900.00, I was absolutely shocked to learn that these products are constructed out of wood particle board. At these prices, I expected a solid, steel construction. Given that Bindertek has cornered the market on this type of product, it seems they are more concerned with their profit margin than creating a high-quality product. Either the price needs to come down or the quality improved. Its just not a good value.To add insult to injury, the shelving and packaging were broken apart upon delivery by UPS. It took days for Bindertek to deliver replacement parts, the parts delivered were incomplete, and then it took days more to finally receive the last of the replacements. Since I needed to get my binders neatly shelved in a small space, I just suffered through the process. In retrospect, I would not have bought the shelving at all and went to another option."
2237,1,"As far as I know, we have still not received out seals. Everyone else offers pre-printed forms to help you organize your corporation. You offer nothing, not even the name of the corporation on the book. We have to print our own stock certificates. I will never use your services again and will tell everyone I know to go somewhere else."
2238,3,"I spent $35 (incl. shipping) on a 4"" binder from you because my daughter desperately needs one and I can't find them in any stores. Her current binder is falling apart, poor kid, and it takes 5 minutes to get it to fit in her backpack. But the school requires it, so I was fine with spending so much. We were so excited when we opened it, only to find the rings are like an inch smaller than the binder!!! She can't fit her stuff in it. What good will that do?I would have returned it immediately but didn't feel like spending the balance of what would be my refund on return shipping for something we can't use.Very disappointed with this purchase. Sherri McFall971.334.4513."
2239,3,"I ordered a name tag with a pin on the back and a velvet bag to hold it. The nametag arrived promptly, with a magnet on the back and no velvet bag. I haven’t yet figured out how to return it to ask that things be made right. What a hassle!"

2241,2,"After months of attempting to order from this company, I am pulling the plug. I sent them the file 3 times, the last time two weeks ago. They told me I would get an artwork proof, and I never did. I logged onto their website to see they had cancelled my order. I called up and got no customer help whatsoever, except to learn that I was automatically booted out of their system."
2242,2,"I have been a customer of nametagcountry since 2015, but the customer service I grew to depend on is no longer there. Their express reorder is neither express nor a reorder of a previous tag. If you order more than one tag at a time, they only give you a proof of one of them and charge you for ""extra"" proofs. I've been in email contact with someone in customer service and this is the sort of answer I received: ""Without having knowledge of our software and production process, it may be difficult to envision how we produce name tags without providing proofs of each name. We don't have to ""lay it out again"". Everything about your approved design (template) is saved in our system, including font sizing. You must give us the person's name again so we know what name you want on the tag. If you give us the same person's name from a past order, that tag will look identical to the tag you received in the past. If you give us a different name, that name will also have the same sizing per your saved design. Sizing will be the same regardless of the configuration of the information, per the approved design you choose. If we encounter a situation where we feel another proof is needed for a previously approved design, based on the information you provide, then we will absolutely prepare another proof, but this is a rare occurrence.We serve more small businesses and produce more small orders than larger orders. On any given day we produce between 200-300 orders. Our average order is less than 10 name tags, with different names. We assume that our customers will order different names on their name tags, that is why the customer's approved template is saved to their account and why they must provide the names for the tags each time they order. Our system, and this method of ordering, has worked for us and our customers for over 15 years, and we have thousands of satisfied customers. I invite you to see our reviews on TrustPilot.com We would not attempt to use or continue an ordering process that didn't work."""
2243,2,"Bad customer service!— Placed an order on 9/6, my scheduled shipping date was 9/10. Called on 9/17 to check the status (my item should have already shipped), to be informed that their machine was down & wouldn’t be fixed until 9/21, but that my order would now ship on 9/24. Sent an email on 9/25 for an update on my package. It still hadn’t shipped & the machine was being fixed that day. Finally my item shipped on 9/27 & I received it on 10/1. Bad customer service for not sending a courtesy email about the delay due to their machine being down. But I did get reimbursed 10%. I will not be ordering from them again."
2244,3,"I recently ordered an acrylic telephone stand from UrbanGirl Office Supply. The item arrived broken into two pieces and, therefore, useless. Per UrbanGirl's request, I e-mailed a photo of the damaged item. I have requested a refund three times within the past two weeks. UrbanGirl has not responded."
2245,3,"The company had a NO RETURN POLICY. I totally understand that, however, I requested my order be cancelled DAYS before it even shipped. They refused to do ANYTHING at all to help me! False advertising! Their only recourse was""we're sorry you're not happy. We've had this problem before so I guess we need to work on the wording"". That was it!!!!!"
2246,2,We paid a extra $75.00 for good delivery service and I am very upset that the delivery service called RL delivery wanted to charge me extra to use their lift gate on the truck or help from the driver! I was lucky to be home when the driver was there. He said he would have drove away and not dropped the package if I wasn't there! Wow! very upsetting! might not order the rest of my supplies from UrbanGirl!
2247,1,"Warning, do not buy gifts from here. I just received a gift from Urban Girl. Really cute stuff but a few of the items i already have. I called to see how I could exchange them or get store credit and they said they could do neither. The money would have to be credited back to the gift giver and then I would have to ask them to buy me a gift card?! You never want to make more work for someone who was thoughtful enough to get you a gift."
2248,1,"I ordered two file boxes from Urban Girl Office. They were a little pricey, but I decided to splurge. I paid for the boxes with paypal and didn't realize that my old address in paypal would supersede the address I had put into my Urban Girl account as the shipping address. My boxes, unfortunately, went to my old address. When I called UPS they said they couldn't help me and that I should contact Urban Girl. When I did that, I talked to two people who essentially passed the buck. Yes, it's true, I should have updated my address in paypal, but it never occurred to me that a business would create a mailing label that was other than the one I put into my account. Now I know better, and I also know never, ever to shop at this website again. Hopefully, no one else will either and we will all be spared their contempt for their customers."
2249,2,"I did NOT get what I ordered. I previewed the stamp online before I placed my order and what I needed it to say filled the entire stamp. I work with Elderly people so I needed the bigger font. I ordered a 3/4x2 stamp and got a 3/4x3/4 stamp. When I called, the representative said it was all my fault and they could not replace the stamp to what I had previewed before placing the order. I will be finding another company to order through."
2250,2,"I felt it was too difficult dealing with the person I believe her name was Carole. I was a first time buyer and I asked her to call me just so she can explain a little better. She did not, I felt that was poor taste regarding customer service. When she did finally call and leave a message more than one person heard the message at my company and agreed that she seemed very irritated with me. So I really did not have a good experience and for that I will never order from them again."
2251,3,"Unfortunately, the wrong stamps were sent to me. Still waiting for the correct ones (8 of them). This morning I received a call saying that they could not supply the ""teal"" color requested and would be back ordered. I asked for a simple blue ink instead. Got a call back again saying that they didn't have blue ink. All I could get was black or red. The website has many colors to choose from but only black and red was available. Still waiting patiently for them to send me my stamps. Sorry to say, but this is not a great experience. Not having what is advertised, slow shipping. Should have stayed with my original vendor as I've never experienced this before ordering simple rubber stamps. I sure hope the quality is worth the wait,...if they ever get here."
2252,1,I placed a request for check boxes to be added with the rubber stamp customer service rep on the phone. I hit the button to charge my card and when I received the item. It had no check boxes so I called and they stated it does not show on their system. Buyer Beware.
2253,2,"I placed an order on 12/10/18, after reading great reviews about them. Ordering was easy, called in our payment same day. Two weeks later they want me to send proof I made payment because they can't find any record of it. The owner was out of town so I had no access to get proof. Finally was able to get the statement and send it to them, paid and dated 12/10/18. I received half the order. Today is 01/11/19, a full month later and still waiting for the rest. Wish it had been better, we will definitely never order from here again. Only positive is Diana has been extremely helpful."
2254,3,"Ordered because of an advertised 4-day turnaround. Reached out 7 days later to find out I need to wait another week. Apparently, somewhere in the email, way after the estimated date they add the info that they are backed up. So, you get an email with a subject line ""Your order is being printed"", open it to see that the estimated date to be shipped is within four days (loud and clear), but if you read further, way below, they mention that it also could be delayed by 6 days. IMHO if your competitive edge is a 4-day turnaround, delays need to be communicated BEFORE I place the order. You are obviously aware you are running behind since the ""we are backed up"" message is a part of your automated email notification.I did forego my regular printer who guarantees a 10-day turnaround because I needed it faster. My order was ""printing"" on May 1st, it is May 9th and it hasn't been shipped yet.------The customer success representative reached out and offered an overnight shipment for my order for free. Which is nice of them. As I mentioned on the phone, I'd be happy to remove this review if the company changes the way they communicate about delays. I'm sorry for customer service guys picking up the slack after management."
2255,1,"Our labels were shipped with the wrong color. When you have a company and branding matters, this is unacceptable. We raised the concern, and they called back to inform us that they simply weren't going to help us. They fell back on a notable caveat in their terms...wait for it:They don't ensure that your colors are correct. Yep, it's true. And we're proof...we had the color code (in hex) right on our proof. It was ignored. And when it happened, they effectively said: ""well, we told you so - it's your own fault"".We run a business, and would absolutely never dream of:1) Ignoring the color of the proof that the customer sent.2) Shipping said labels to the customer anyhow, hoping that they don't notice.3) Telling them to pound sand when we're called on to fix the error.We understand making mistakes, but we also expect a legit company to fix those mistakes when they happen. These guys are not legit.Seriously, take your business elsewhere - it's not worth the frustration. Especially after the service experience. Just horrible.We'll likely leave a video review on youtube so you all can see for yourselves.

2256,3,"Terrible experience and waste of precious time. You can not design and print your labels from their website and even worse is that your saved designs can not be re-printed from your computer, There is no option to open saved files, it is directing you to pay $10 for 1 sheet of 10 labels and wait 10 days to get them... This is ridiculous! I bought their blank labels on Amazon only because i need to print them right away, i can not wait 10-11 days!"
2257,2,"After being a customer for over 2 years and spending $1,000's of dollars per year, they refuse to honor their guarantee. Recently I have had an order never arrived that they made me pay for. And another order of labels that don't work in 6 different printers. They also refuse to replace these labels or pay for expedited shipping to get me replacement labels for the ones that do not work. At the end of the day you do not get ""guaranteed results"" or anything from them. Don't order Polyester or weatherproof labels. Also, shipping takes 10 days. All and all, not worth working with them with all the other companies out there that make the exact same products. I called twice to try and let them fix the issue and the support staff was rude and dismissive."
2258,2,"This label paper will NOT suck up! I used online labels, but I hated that they didn't offer any free shipping no matter how much or little you bought so I went with this company. NEVER AGAIN. They charge the same amount of money, but there is something different about these sheets. I called in and the rep gave me the age-old excuse of so many printers and all that. This brother printer is BRAND NEW. Not 2 weeks old! I've printed so many different kinds of paper in this thing I can't keep up. (I'm a business.) No issues whatsoever until I started messing with THIS company. I am having to manually feed these labels in and even then, the printer keeps reading that the printer is jammed when it is not! I'm so over it. This is my first AND LAST purchase with this company."
2259,3,"We were looking for larger beach balls so when we saw that theirs would be 16” in diameter, we thought we finally found them and place an order for 50. When the balls arrived and we blew them up, they were only about 9-10 inches inflated. We were so disappointed that we contacted their customer service (which btw only responds in the wee hours of the morning via email). I was told that they measure these things deflated, flat, and including the extended nozzle. They have since updated their product description online to say measured deflated but still do not provide the final inflated size."
2260,3,"Never received my order. I typically dont write reviews, but this is absolutely unacceptable.First time ordering, the day I was suppose to receive my order, which was a month later, I found out it magically got canceled bc they underestimated shipping cost instead. So I reordered notifying them to charge the extra $21 for shipping so I can receive my order this time. Waited another month emailing in the meantime to make sure it's coming since they took my money off my card, yet no reply. A day after the last day order was expected I emailed them AGAIN. Finally someone emailed me back saying the order was suppose to be shipped directly from vendor and they would contact me once they figured out what's going on. 3 MONTHS LATER!...still waiting on my order AND an honest response. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! How do you stay in business?"
2261,3,"For some reason this company used an international shipping company to ship a 5 oz Oz product from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania. Then USPS picked it up, which meant another day and a half delay. It took 4 days to arrive. Which meant the item I purchased I no longer needed. And I paid for shipping."
2262,1,"I would give 0 stars If that were an option. I paid way over the top far an item because I couldn't find it anywhere else (the shipping charge was outrageous!) When I received the item it was not editable so I called and asked what I should do. They said to send a picture so I did (I was given the wrong Email so it took several calls to get this figured out). I heard nothing. I called multiple times and they said they would pass the info on. Again heard nothing. Finally they said they would reach out to the vendor. A month later and after multiple calls I was told the vendor said they looked fine (you had to blow up the picture to see the item was literally covered with grease). I asked what I should do with them, would they return them or cover some of my costs (over $200. with shipping) and again I was told they would get back to me. This time they did send me an Email with the message: Case closed. I would highly recommend you think twice before ordering from this company!"
2263,3,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Ordered at opentip on 4/28. Order was supposed to be delivered between 5/3 and 5/7. According to tracking details order was processed on 5/7 and ready to go out. On 5/13 it was still not received by carrier. I inquired on 5/9 as to when I would receive my order because I NEED it by 5/15. They replied on 5/13 that ""it had been shipped"". No other information, no excuses, no apology, nothing! Tracking info on 5/14 states it has been received by DHL and is on way to USPS. NOT acceptable."
2264,3,Update - Changed to one star due to the false response given to the review. There has been no follow up to the problem - them not printing the item correctly. Pretty garbage work so far...I am torn between two stars and three stars. They are fast and responsive in the ordering process and they beat their projected production time - you really can't beat that. At this moment you say to yourself why 2 stars and not 5 - right? Well the only way to fall is to not produce what you were asked and that is exactly what happened. Our corporate symbol has a sword as part of the emblem and they left the bottom point off - and it looks a lot junky without the point ( a one star move). Initially I thought I may have approved a bad proof but upon examination of the proof - the proof was in fact correct and contained the point of the sword. Our event is soon and there isn't a time for an exchange and they haven't responded to my customer service ticket (Johnny on the spot during the order - nil heard with a problem). We will just make sure anyone that gets the bottles knows the origin of the poor workmanship.
2265,1,"DO NO TRUST Discount Mugs to get your items on time. If I could give them zero stars I would. We ordered koozies for an important event for our organization. Online they promised delivery the day prior to the event if we paid expedited shipping. No problem. Well, I never heard from them, did not receive any follow up emails or tracking information. When I called customer service once again they promised to have the koozies on time and of course they hadn't even gone into production the day that they were due to arrive. To add insult to injury, the only remedy they could deliver on was to remove the expedited shipping cost (that they could not deliver on) and a $25 in store credit. No thank you!"
2266,3,"I placed a time sensitive order that was needed for an event on 6/4. The estimate was that it would be in hand no later than 5/24. Then that got pushed out to 5/31, which was not what was promised, but was acceptable. I found out the day before the event that I would not receive this order until 6/6. A portion (40 of the 250 items I ordered) was delivered at 3:30 PM on 6/4.I called the company and they promised to have someone call me back, which never happened. The person I originally spoke for blamed me for the issue because I didn't pay for ""rush"" services. I didn't do this because the non-rush timeline was acceptable to me. The ""rush"" services option may be a policy for Discount Mugs but seems like an abdication of accountability and an excuse to me. At no point was it communicated to me that, if I needed the item by a specific date, I would have to pay extra.I order a lot of things like this and will have to take Discount Mugs off of my list of reliable vendors."
2267,3,"Absolutely lousy experience. I found out that the items I paid for upfront with one day rush shipping were back-ordered. Only way I found this out was when I called to find out where they were. I ordered a secondary product to coordinate with this which proved to be useless since the main item was back-ordered. Best offer I received was 20% off of that order. Then, my refund was never processed and it took another phone call to finally get my money refunded. Lousy."
2268,3,"On June 8, 2017 made a purchase totaling $302.50 - Receipt said $302.50.On June 22, 2017 made another purchase totaling $260.50 - Receipt said $260.50.But When credit card statement received a ""FRGN TRANS FEE - IMPRINTPLUS"" of $6.05 was added to June 8th purchase and a $5.21 ""FRGN TRANS FEE - IMPRINTPLUS"" was added to June 22 purchase!These charges were never shown as part of on-line purchase! Very upset!"
2269,3,"The ordering process was easy; however I canceled the order shortly after placing it and received a confirmation it was canceled, yet the product still showed up. The delivery was fast; however the communication was poor since I did not want this product and now have to go through the process of trying to return it and get credited."
2270,3,I called to ask where i could find my item on line and she told me exactly where to find the item but never even offered to order it for me. It would have been nice to have her order it for me instead of me spending the next 10 minutes ordering it on line myself. The shipping charge was $12 and yet a week later i still do NOT have my item. I'm disappointed in their service.
2271,3,"I went to the web site to resupply materials. The site is not intuitive, is actually confusing and hard to find what I needed. For example, pins that we purchased as part of our startup kit (white), were not even available to buy as a resupply? Not a very good shopping site. Products are great, we are very pleased with the products, just not with the difficulty to resupply. Also, there are NO quantity discounts available on the site."
2272,3,"This is an international company, apparently, because the credit card charge was classified as an international charge when I placed the order. Not even a day later, my credit card was again charged, this time fraudulently, in another international transaction. Shopnamebadges.com needs to re-evaluate their payment security, because I have no doubt my credit card information was stolen when I purchased name badges through them. Furthermore, their order processing time took more than 2 business days - which kind of defeats the purpose of paying nearly $50 extra for Next Day Air shipping."
2273,3,Used bait and switch. Sent me item different than promised. Would not issue a return label after being put off for a week and several phone calls. Lied to or led me on repeatedly. Did not respond to emails. I fear I will be out the expense of returning a six pound laptop case that does not suit my needs and having to dispute the charge through my credit card company.
2274,3,"Same bait and switch as other customers reported. They sent me the wrong stapler and tried to tell me mine was discontinued just days before I ordered it, but for some reason my invoice withe tracking info lists the item I ordered, so there was no way for me to know they were just going to choose nay stapler for me. When I contacted customer service, they insisted they sent me a better model. I disagree completely and they said they can charge me more money to send it back. I simply asked for a refund of some of the shipping costs they charged me so that the amount I paid would be similar to what other websites were selling the stapler they sent me and they indicated they could not do that."
2275,1,"CROOK COMPANY !!!!!!! . DO NOT BUY FROM THEM ! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT . STILL DID NOT GET REFUND . CALLED + EMAIL EVERYDAY AND WAS TOLD WILL BE REFUNDED BACK TO MY CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT . DO NOT BUY STUFF FROM THEM .WORST COMPANY EVER . TAKE MORE THAN 6 WEEKS STILL NOT MENTION WHEN I CAN GET MY REFUND . ONLY $82.00 - 25%RESTOCKING FEE , STILL DID NOT GET MY REFUND !!!

2276,3,"Wish it was possible to give them no stars. Ordered a kit for a paper folding machine. Was to be rollers, cleaning solution and a rag. Ordered it in January - received the order 5 weeks later....WITHOUT the rollers. I have called several times a week. Always supposedly assured that our order has shipped ""you will receive a shipping e-mail by 5PM"". Last time it was 2 week that it had not shipped. Label was created - but nothing was shipped. Will not issue an RMA to return what we have - that is of no use to us without the rollers."
2277,1,"Based on my experience and having read other reviews here, it is my belief that Ace Depot makes money exclusively via frauding customers and the occasional successful dropship. Here is my story: A particular marking ink our store carries was discontinued in January, thus were on the quest for any backstock we could find and Google led us to Ace Depot. Their site showed an abundance of stock so we placed an order for 99 units on 2/18/19. Our payment was processed and we waited for a shipment email. After three-plus weeks, I contacted Ace Depot on 3/11 and enquired about the shipment. They informed me they were waiting for a restock and our order would ship 3/20.During this time, I also made contact with the manufacturer of the ink who informed us they had no record of Ace Depot nor were any companies expecting a restock of the formula as it was COMPLETELY and permanently sold out. We thought it rather fishy that the manufacturer and AD would have such different information, so my coworker called AD anonymously on 3/12 and enquired about the product. ACE DEPOT LIED and claimed they DID have the product in stock and could ship to her same day, DESPITE THE FACT WE HAD BEEN TOLD THEY HAD NO STOCK. I emailed them about the conflicting information 3/12, they responded 3/13 and claimed the other rep had been misinformed and they were still waiting for a restock. I should have canceled the order then and there but I am evidently gullible and colorblind to red flags. On 3/27 our order had still not shipped. I emailed them again. On 3/28 they responded and said they had only received stock of a different color and asked if it would work for us. I responded and asked about whether or not they were going to receive the color we needed. THEY DID NOT RESPOND UNTIL 4/15! If you are keeping track, that is nearly two months from the beginning of the order and the initial charge to our card. I called, furious, on 4/17. They promised they were rush shipping our order and that if it did not arrive by 4/22 they would issue a full refund. Sure enough, 4/22 came and went with no shipment. When I contacted them asking for a refund my request was IGNORED and they instead told me again they were ""waiting for a shipment."" It was then that I realized they were attempting to run out the clock on a potential chargeback via our AmEx. I called and emailed them again requesting a return before finally filing a chargeback that was, of course, successful via AmEx. I thought it was the end of the story until MAY 8th when they somehow charged our card AGAIN and sent a shipping confirmation. Again- now three months since the inital order PLUS they obviously kept our card on file without our consent. How could it get worse, you ask? WELL! The ""product"" finally arrive and instead of being the name brand, bottled and labeled ink it was PAINT! PAINT!!! Alcohol-based generic paint in squishy bottles with no toxicity information, ingredient list or warnings. NOT WHAT WE ORDERED AT ALL.The most amazing thing? They refuse to refund me unless we pay the return shipping ($$$) and on top of that they insist on charging a 25% restocking fee. Obviously, we called AmEx again.TO ACE DEPOT, as I said in my last email and in our phone conversations: send a shipping label, return the funds and take your stupid paint. Literally the worst online shopping experience I have EVER had in business or personal life. Everyone else: be thankful you had the common sense to google reviews before buying- I wish I had. DO NOT SHOP HERE."
2278,1,Website listed broken buttons for iPhone under damaged. Didn't mention that if it was the touch sensor that was damaged then it is considered broken and payout was half. Phone was in great condition otherwise. Felt like I was ripped off but didn't want to bother with having them send it back so took the crappy deal.
2279,2,"Ok transaction--somewhat better than trying to sell on Craigslist or eBay. Continuous form communication, not relevant to the actual status of my sellback, was NOT appreciated. I received multiple form email messages and a form text message. One of the email messages stated that they did not receive my phones--even when USPS reported them retrieved from the post office. Replies to those form messages, including use of actual email address instead of form letter reply addresses, went unanswered--they did not respond ""immediately"". Form communication sent over the New Year's holiday, even when it was stated that the office would be closed for the Christmas / New Year's holidays. A telephone call to the company did not receive a response. No bounce messages received when I tried communicating via email. These communication problems would not have been an issue except they used intercom-mail.com to send their form communication and did not pay attention to details. Experience not good--will be much more careful in purchasing cell phones to avoid needing to sell them.Reply: Note that OPEN communication is NOT maintained. NO responses were received to my emailed messages--both to your form letter email addresses and your standard email addresses. Including the form letter inquiry stating my phones were not received when, in fact, they were picked up at the post office earlier that day. Urgency is not maintained as no responses were received. I will not be sending any emails to you as time appears to be wasted in doing so.Reply 2: ANY missed email message is bad--however, MULTIPLE ""missed"" email messages = unprofessional. I am an IT pro and know how email systems work."
2280,3,"I sent my phone in November 20/ 2017 to them, they get my phone Saturday November 25/17. I have a lot of email where they said my check was sent on November 27/17. But I never get my check, the policies said they i have between 3 to 5 Business to get my check, but today is my 12 day waiting the check. I will demand this company for that reason."
2281,3,"Choose buybackboss after a friend recommended them was told $65 when I filled in all the details of my said phone. Mailing to them was painless printed the sheet and sent it via USPS. Three days later got an email saying their offer was lowered to $44 dollars for stuff that I made perfectly aware to them when I filed out the initial information. I told them that I had been offered more from three different places but stayed with them because of my word, my friends referral and their guarantee. They didn’t care about that just like they didn’t care about me. So now my option is send it back across the country and start over. Such a giant waste of time. It sounds like people have had great experiences on here and I wish I could say the same but feels more like a bait and switch with my time and their postage costs being held hostage all for a $21 difference."

I had to open a query with PayPal to get my money back....Paypal sent a query to Cellunlocker and I did get my money after a couple of days.I had to search for other supplier and found (Unlockbase), in 48h I had the unlock code for my phone, good service, but more expensive then Cellunlocker."

I gave photos and links to show that many people have the same issue with this flaw in these $300+ headphones headbands and all I get is ""Please note ALL PHYSICAL DAMAGE (including WATER DAMAGE) will void the warranty and the item will be rejected once our inspection confirms the damage."" with a return fee of £30 (plus outward shipping costs to HK).They avoid the actual issue of the item having a known flaw in design or material... they just make this stuff up to avoid their warranty obligations and try and scare you with made up fees.Based on this logic, if your headphones burst into flames on your head, the warranty is void as they are now pysically damaged.Scammy warranty, staff don't care, make false accusations and refer to statements in the warranty that don't even exist."

2299,3,"""we guarantee that each order is Complete, On-Time and Error-Free"" is that a joke?I bought a very specific items made for Sprint phone. I chose the Sprint HTC TOUCH PRO 2 phone from your website and look for the accessories. I bought 2 extended battery covers and you sent me a Verizon HTC TOUCH PRO2 extended battery door cover with VERIZON logo on it. Fitment is perfect but color doesn't match. very light gray from Verizon and pure BLACK from SPRINT. First purchase from you and will be the last. I would rate you negative stars if I can for their service. I have 100% positive feedback 300+ and counting from eBay with $75,000 purchases over the last 5 years. I do expect poor services from oversea retailer but not from USA retailer like themselves. Prepaid return label is not good enough. They wasted my time and I already put the battery door covers you sent me in trash.

2300,3,Seems that if you have a problem with HTCPedia the only way to get any assistance is to post a negative comment on trustpilot. My first email request for help went unanswered. My first trustpilot comment received imeadiate response but 5 days later I have received no resolution response. More than extremely upset with this service.Ken Anderson.
2301,1,"All these positive reviews are because the store sent out an email promising the first 250 reviewers a free case if they write a positive review. I can't be bought! That's how much this store sucks. It took forever for me to get what I ordered, and it was so horribly packaged that when I received my cart mount, it was already damaged. When I told them about it, they wanted me to pay d'or shopping again. I will never shop with their site again. Check amazon for better pricing and service."
2302,2,"before i purchase my item, i emailed them to make sure its working or not, they said its working. but when the item is here. we called for help. they hang us up 3 times! 3 TIMES! very unprofessional, very bad attitude. the customer service really sucks.the item is not working, and we have to hire a electronica to fix everything, which cost us $200 dollars extra. I don know what to say, but I will never buy from this site again."
2303,3,"Bad experience from the start. I called customer service, inquiring about shipping cost on Google and their website. The guy I spoke to was rude, but I decided to buy the tv anyways. Couple days later, I get an email informing me that they didn't have the tv. Then offered me to buy another one. I declined, but asked them if I could get a discount because of the bad experience. Again the guy was rude. Bad experience all the way."
2304,2,"I ordered a voltage converter for $349 which included free shipping. Item arrived, had a faulty outlet and was of very poor quality. Returned item which cost $75 as they insisted it be returned by UPS. It took a month to get a refund and this was minus $45 for their ""free"" shipping costs. So I am now out of pocket $120 due to being sent a faulty item, as well as the cost of having the transformer installed by an electrician, only to find it didn't work. I was offered a power strip to plug into one of the remaining working outlets but I would like a new product to work 100% if I'm spending that much money on it. On top of that, I was accused of fraud when I told them the item was faulty. Charming. Will never do business with these nasty people again."
2305,1,"Horrible company to deal with. They refused to cancel a shipment ; minutes after placing order. Then , even though I requested they cancel the order they ""shipped"" it anyways. Tried to cancel through PayPal but PayPal said the sellers provided a tracking # and item was delivered. . so not only will the company not listen to customers they also lie to PayPal."
2306,1,"Do not buy from 110220volts.com. Warranty is a lies, basically refuses everything. Once you bought it from them, you are done. Scam on all the additional charges. they will ship you some damaged non good condition item. After you requested a return authorization, the nightmare started. They basically issued the RMA # to you. You will have to responsibility to pay for the return shipping and the original shipping cost which stated ""free shipping"" . They basically made up some amount with the shipping charge. If you paid an item $100 , you returned it with your own cost $30 , and they will bill you another $30. Turns out you will only getting $40 store credit. That's how this business make money. They don't do refund. Double standard meaning on warranty and free shipping."
2307,1,"Worst company ever! Phone never worked and when I asked for a refund, they would not refund in full because they said that I made calls. I was stuck in South Africa without a way to communicate with ANYONE. I would make a phone call (dialed correctly) it would ring once and then a screen would pop up and say that I would get a call back shortly and then tell me my balance. I never got a call back and was never able to successfully make a call. Then, they just charged me another $5 to extend a phone number for another month. Obviously I am not using the simcard because it DOESN'T WORK. I have never dealt with a company as bad as this one."
2308,1,"I purchased OneSimCard Europe based on the advertisement that incoming calls would be free in Europe. Less than two weeks later, when my daughter had just arrived in Europe, the incoming call rate for Switzerland changed from 0c per minute to 65c per minute, making this option totally unusable. I paid US$30 for a card that cannot be used and OneSimCard refused to reimburse me despite the fact that the information they published was clearly known to them at the time. This company cannot be trusted. Buy a local SIM instead or use a more reliable company."
2309,1,"Had the WORST experience using OneSimCard. Firstly their website and product offerings are very confusing and unclear. I spent $100 buying a SIM and data package with expedited shipping for my trip. I checked to make sure the 5 countries I was travelling to were covered.Then upon arriving my SIM stopped working in 3/5 countries I thought I was covered in. Customer service brushed this off by simply telling me I had purchased ""the wrong sim card"" and that the data package did not cover this. By the way, they have the same data packages for different sim cards at the SAME price which is really confusing and unclear. So I was unable to use the SIM card in 3/5 countries I was travelling to.Next I was informed the day before that my data package would expire the next day, when I asked for an extension from customer service, they brushed me off again, simply just saying ""No"" and overall being incredibly unhelpful. This whole process has been nothing but confusing, frustrating and stressful during my travels. I had such high hopes for this product since I travel all the time. What a waste of money, terrible product, abysmal customer service. DO NOT BUY."
2310,1,"poor value for money in every aspect! data packages are extremely expensive, so much so that it is cheaper to use the roaming on your US phone. The phones they sell with the Europe card are good for 2G and 3G when most of Europe is 4G and higher; the networks they use in Europe are the ones with poorest coverage and speed; don't do automatic refill or you will get an unpleasant surprise on your credit card; you have to register your phone and start your package before you leave the US otherwise you will not be able to use the phone when you arrive, You will have to find free wifi and pray. They are disorganized: I received the invoice for an order from Germany with my package; fly to Europe and buy a local card. It is so much cheaper and it works as long as you have a valid passport."
2311,1,"This service is terrible and the and borders on fraud. There is all kinds of fine print everywhere in their website that is impossible to fully read without enormous effort before you enroll. Numerous calls from the US to my personal extra number (PEN) did not go through. In a two week trip to Greece and Israel I had to contact tech/customer support eight times. In the iPhone there is a profile that gets installed that shows you the remaining balance on the account. It was showing a balance of $25.55 (after starting with $30) when a business call I was on was disconnected because of insufficient funds. I was told I had to activate the additional $20, I had already paid for, which I did, only to be told it was used up already when my call was disconnected, despite paying for $50.00 in data and voice service when I enrolled. I primarily used WhatsApp and I was using the OneSimCard voice VERY little during this trip. I still cant figure out what happened to the additional $20 that disappeared. I should add that contrary to the response below, there is most definitely a profile that gets added into an iPhone and there is a feature in the profile that allows you to check your balance (which is apparently not accurate). I only know about this feature because one of the CSRs told me about it. BTW, I have been unable to remove their profile and install the one from my carrier since removing their sim card and replacing it with the my original one from my US carrier. I have spent many hours on the phone with Apple over the last day+ and the incident has been escalated to the Apple engineering department. I am still unable to connect to my data feed since I returned over 48 hours ago (though I do have voice and text).I plan on disputing the entire charge with my credit card company!!"
2312,3,I'm just paid to renew my iphone coverage back in December.. Now i need to make a claim but website is down and phone number doesn't work.. When did they close shop and were refunds issued????
2313,3,Shipped my phone to them and it's been two months and still don't have it. They are trying to repair a very damaged phone. How do they expect you to be without your phone for that long?
2314,3,"I filed a claim and expected contact within the 4 - 6 hour SLA that's promoted on the site. I called two days later to be told 'all our claims and purchases are backed up. We don't know when our system will be back up, call us again Monday.' Given the issue is on GoCare's side I'd expect proactive and regular communication to those affected. Poor customer experience, especially given it's for my son's school computer and they'll give him a loaner only through the end of this month."
2315,3,They got my phone for about 3 weeks and didn't say a word about the repairment process. I tried to contact the service center several times but they just kept silence! When I got the phone back nothing changed...
2316,3,They have had my sons computer for a month. Waiting for an update. Have sent multiple messages asking for an update on the servicing of computer. no response. Its been way too long. I need answers. Where is this computer?
2317,1,"I purchased a Spigen case on the 23/11/2018 and paid extra for express delivery. It arrived on the 28/12/2018. That's 5 weeks later exactly. Shocking stuff and a terrible customer experience.While there is an indication of the stock levels on the MobileFun website it is nowhere near accurate and in my experience is just a gimmick. When I emailed customer service on the 28/11/2018 enquiring about the status of the purchase I was told ""The item you have enquired about is currently expected to be in stock on the 30/11/18"" ""Your order would be added to a back-order list, and it will be immediately dispatched to you as soon as the stock arrives."" That's a long way off the 28/12/2018.DO NOT USE MobileFun. Stick with Amazon or other reputable vendors."
2318,3,"They sell products (specifically, Whitestone Dome) that claim to have a ""limited lifetime warranty"", but when you make a warranty claim, there are issues.1. There's nothing anywhere that mentions Mobile Fun is in charge of the warranty even though the warranty is allegedly from the manufacturer.2. There's no obvious warranty claim process - you just have to email Mobile Fun repeatedly until they cave and send a replacement. They responded AFTER I sicced Whitestone on them.3. Even though it states ""limited lifetime"", Mobile Fun says that means they'll only replace it 3 times, and only within 1 year of purchase.4. When you make your second warranty claim (well inside this one year timeframe), they'll tell you you've exhausted the warranty.

2319,1,"Ordered a Note 8 cover for my new phone - and received an S8 cover instead. When I raised the issue, they confirmed that it was an error that they will gladly replace my cover when I return the original to them via registered post. I highlighted to them that I needed a cover for my phone an waiting another couple of weeks while they receive their product back and only then issue my original order wasn't acceptable - they confirmed that it would be best to send me a refund once they have got the incorrectly shipped item back, confirming that they will reimburse me the additional shipping costs (which I was okay with, not overly happy about but I felt that it was the best way forward). Well, I got re reimbursement for the original order but no payment for the costs to get their product back to them - out of pocket by 13 Euro and have absolutely nothing to show for it - requests to solve this falls on deaf ears. I would suggest that you stay away from this company, if things go wrong with your order you end up paying.

If a company claims to be Canadian, they need to disclose if there will be customs charges and MAKE IT CLEAR THE PRODUCT IS DESIGNED FOR A DIFFERENT COUNTRY)."
2321,3,"I purchased a Whitestone Dome screen protector from Mobile Fun. Whitestone Dome has a ""limited lifetime warranty"" which states they'll replace both the glass and adhesive should the protector break, or start to lift.What nobody tells you, until you try to take advantage of the warranty, is that Domes purchased through Mobile Fun are replaced by Mobile Fun, and not Whitestone.It took days for me to even reach anybody at Mobile Fun the first time I needed a replacement (less than 3 months after purchase). The second time, less than 4 months after purchase, Mobile Fun said I'd already gotten all the replacements their warranty allowed (I'd gotten one), which means the Mobile Fun warranty is just a joke when compared to Whitestone's advertised warranty.When I asked Mobile Fun for their warranty in writing, they told me they only cover three replacements. So not only is their warranty tiny, they were also refusing to honor even their laughable warranty. I'd asked for a second replacement and they said ""no, we only do 3 replacements"".After badgering them, they agreed to send me a second, but acted very much as though they were doing me a big favor."
2322,3,"I ordered the phone because it says they will ship within 4 days. After one week of no update, I had to be the one to contact them. They then told me it was out of stock and I had to wait another 2 weeks. This is ridiculous because I was only back in the states for a week and therefore, by the time they ship it to me, I am already gone. Perla told me that I had to contact a manager if I want to know the details. Excuse me but shouldn't you contact me to update me? Afterwards since my card couldn't go through the first time, they had to reswipe my card and that took an extra 4 days.So I wasn't able to get my phone and I probably have to wait half a year before I can even use it. Thanks for the professional service Expansys/Perla."
2323,1,"Bought an LG Urbane android watch from Expansis-USA. Called LG to check and learned that it was a grey market watch - made in Korea. So if I want to exercise LG’s 1 year warranty I’ll need to send my watch to Korea!Expansis claims this is clearly disclosed in their Terms and Conditions. But it’s just a statement that “Certain import smartphones, tablets, and other devices may only be covered under warranty in the country of origin.” The product description does not mentioned it was the import version and I didn’t buy this from Expansis-KOREA, I bought it from Expansis_USA.Now I have to either send it back at my cost or accept the crappy 6 month Expansis warranty. Yeah, I’m sure that will work out well. Here’s hoping this watch stands the test of time.Buyer beware. AVOID EXPANSIS."

2331,3,I bought a Jabra step wireless stereo headset. It never worked. First of all it came in a small brown carton that was just plain and there was no packing list. I never thought I would need to return it as it was highly discounted. My hope was even if I use it for 3 months and it packs up that would be ok. Now not even a minute use. I got an approval to return but they want the package it came in and a packing list which I don't have. It's just there and of no use. One of my worst online buys. Never thought an American coy could do this. Very disappointed with the seller.

I got to Israel and by the time I realized it would never work, I had to drive to a big city, find a hotel as it was getting dark. I got lost. If I had not ordered a sim, I would have paid extra for getting internet in my rental car and THAT would have helped me not get lost. Instead I had no phone with which to call a motel. After trying for several hours to get it running, Amigo offered to send me a phone for more money. By then, I was too angry to want anything to do with your company because my first night in Israel sucked because of having no phone. Sorry, but I would never recommend you. Plus, your people argued and tried to keep my money. I have disputed the charges with the credit card company. I will never use your company or even try a sim card again after that. I will just go with Verizon international charges and get internet in my car. What a nightmare and a headache Amigo caused me."

I wrote to Amigo support. They responded with a suggestion to try. I tried it and it did not help. I wrote back saying as much but I did not get any further responses from Amigo support. I did not use the modem for the rest of my stay in Paris. I can't see myself using Amigo again."
2347,1,If I could give negative stars I would. This company cancelled my order without notifying me. The only reason I knew of the cancellation is because I looked it up. They stated in their online chat that they cancelled the order due to the product not meeting the quality standards. They then listed the product as a grade B and raised the price by more than $100. Classic bait and switch. I certainly hope that they reverse any credit card charges. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY>.
2348,2,"I'm shocked at how bad my experience with this company has been. First I ordered a router off eBay from them, I tested the item, and within minutes it kept dying, it doesn't work. I open a claim, then I get a refund an no message. Okay fine I got my money back, I tossed the router...not thrilled but not angry. Then I noticed you could buy things off their site directly, they had a first time promo code for 10% off, seemed like a good deal, I bought a Monster Retro speaker and a hard drive. I got the speaker yesterday...it has NO POWER SUPPLY...ummm okay. I contacted them via chat and they said that they ""will try"" to send out a power supply and if not I would get a partial refund, I said that isn't good enough, I would rather return the item for a full refund if they can't provide what I paid for. Well in between I realized I have 12V DC power supplies for various devices. I tried TWO of them...the Monster Retro speaker doesn't turn on at all. So not only did they not include a power supply, they didn't test the item and they sent me a dead item and supposedly this was a ""grade A"" item according to their website...I would hate to see what a ""grade B"" item was like! I'm expecting an external hard drive from them today but after two strikes I'm expecting a third one. Even if it works I'm am so burnt out by my experience with this ""company"" that I would not go back. If I don't get my money soon I will be filing a chargeback with my credit card company."
2349,3,"I ordered 2 items. I have used some discount coupon on the first order. Then I have ordered the second one without discount. So, they have sent the second order in 2 days. The first one got stuck in processing status 10 days and then they cancelled that order. Billing and payment information for both orders was same and they found some problems in the first one. Strange. Terrible. I hope at least the give a refund."
2350,1,This place is horrible. Never got my refund check and it's been almost a month. Everytime I email them they always have an excuse about refunding me and then I would call to ask them again and they would say they couldnt refund me back. I do not recommend this place to anyone. All they sell are junk stuff and will never refund you and admit to their words.
2351,3,Purchased a new Samsung Tablet thru ebay. Instead received old used tablet completely different model. Requested return and it was granted. After receiving the return the VIP Outlets claimed that I returned old item instead of the one they send me and they refunded me only 50% of the purchase price. The old product belonged to somebody else before and was full of e-mails and very personal pictures.
2352,1,Unfortunately I fully trusted this company as a first time house buyer and they completely ripped me off. I got the worst rate unimaginable with a credit score of over 800 and no debt and high income. I tried to be super quick and responsive during the process but unfortunately they did the worst job for me and at the end apologizing for what a terrible job they did and asking for the second chance. I'm refinancing my mortgage with almost 1% less rate with another bank which brought my monthly down to almost $450/month.I'll NEVER EVER recommend PERL mortgage to any of my friends.
2353,1,I will never recommend this company to even my worst enemy. My closing was delayed by 4 days. No one kept me updated other than my realtor ( Desi Smith with Ideal Realty in Chicago). She’s the only good that came out of the worst home buying experience I’ve ever had. Lin was the only pet I would recommend at Perl. Unfortunately he did not handle my mortgage. He was the only one person that got back to me in a timely manner. James Counihan and his team are awful!!!! DO NOT USE PERL MORTGAGE!!!!! To put the icing on the cake they wired the money to the wrong title company during the closing. So everyone had to sit and wait for their checks to be dispersed.
2354,2,More paperwork than any other lender. My closing took over 3 hours. The lawyer and realtors said it was the most paperwork they’d ever seen and there were emails requesting more paperwork during the closing. I had to request the final numbers for closing from Perl the night before our morning close. Would never use them again.
2355,3,"Perl Mortgage fee and extra appraisal fees were not disclosed up front! He compared costs side by side with my other loan option with his fees not properly disclosed. The process started out fine with reasonable closing costs estimated and a can do attitude from Bill Siefken. Up until a couple days before closing everything was ""on track."" Then he said he would pull it off if I just jump through a couple more hoops. Then the communication and updates stopped coming from the broker. I had to keep calling him. He would give a time that he would provide an update, but the update wouldn't come. The closing costs continued to go up WAY over the original amount - including additional fees that should have been disclosed up front. Close didn't happen on time and we were not notified that it wouldn't until the day before. Then the next 2 closing dates were also missed. I would provide requested documentation right away, then wait several days to hear back on the status only to find out that they needed additional documentation. If I had been asked for it all at once this would have been much less frustrating. If there had been better communication, this would have been much less frustrating. Luckily the sellers and the sellers' attorney were very helpful and understanding of the situation. Thanks to their understanding of this bad situation, the close did finally happen. Bill notified me by email the day before close that he would not attend the close (without providing a reason). He often blamed others and never took responsibility for the delays he caused. The others he blamed were his ""assistants"" and underwriters. The assistants would make requests, but never answer or return phone calls. I would strongly recommend against using this company. I now understand why mortgage brokers get bad names."
2356,2,"I am beyond disappointed with the level of service and attention to detail provided during our refinance process. There were errors in our appraisal that our mortgage advisor deemed unimportant before he even looked into it. We constantly had to follow up with him regarding questions, his response always had an excuse about how someone else dropped the ball. We were told to sign things, and when we asked questions before signing was told ""don't worry about it, we don't actually need you to sign that"". The tip of the iceberg... One day prior to closing, they still had not provided me with an accurate statement showing what our monthly payment would be. The only reason that I didn't pull the plug on the entire thing is because I had a locked rate and current rates had increased. I have worked with a few Perl staff for 15+ years to finance and refinance several homes, and I will definitely not use Perl again."
2357,1,"They lied to me about my final payment. And they overcharged me on my VA funding fee. J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, LLC is the worst loan company. They couldn't get a consistent document to save their life. All over the place on all their numbers so I know I overpaid on this loan and super bummed and will never use them or suggest them. You should take them off your program."
2358,1,"I applied with JG Wentworth because they were highly recommended by Costco where I have been a member for over 25 years. I had a good experience with the application and all of the many requirements. It was completed start to finish in about 3 weeks which was very good, however before the fourth week was completed, my loan was sold to PennyMac without a hint that this could even happen. So much for the lie that JG Wentworth services it's own loans and my loan would never be sold. I googled PennyMac and found they had a terrible reputation. So now I'm stuck with PennyMac for 30 years or until they decide to sell my loan. So much for my due diligence on JG Wentworth. I asked this question, ""Do you sell your loans?"" The answer was. ""No, we do not sell our loans and we service the loans we make.""I was very uncomfortable with all the personal information that JG Wentworth required, but they said that due to Dodd/Frank all this personal information was required and that they would keep it secure because they will be my mortgage company for the next 30 years. Well as it turned out, I never made one payment to JG Wentworth. They sold my loan within less than a week after closing and I was never informed that possibility even existed until after the fact.Tell me, how could I ever believe anything I am told by JG Wentworth? Costco needs to get someone that tells its members the truth when answering questions and gives them endless confidential information which they just sell to someone else at will. THIS PRACTICE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!"
2359,3,"They unilaterally changed the signing date without telling me. They rescheduled it during the time I identified as unavailable. This happened three times. This delayed receiving the funds to pay contractors. Some stopped work. They would not answer the phone or return calls. I have many rentals and loans, but this was by far the worst closing."
2360,3,"I used JG Wentworth, one of Costcos providers and they were and have continued to be horrible. They are rude and extremely disorganized. Costco should do a better job of vetting the companies they recommend, especially with something as important as a mortgage."
2361,1,"We have been Costco members for years and have always been satisfied with their affiliates. However, the mortgage affiliate of JG Wentworth was the most God awful experience! We spent over 6 months working on a loan that they said was preapproved. In the end, we had to go somewhere else. We have stellar credit and enough cash in bank to pay for our house, but wanted to get a mortgage. The amount of paperwork they required was way overboard. Then they would not communicate with us about the status of our loan. They talked out of both sides of their mouth. Costco really dropped the ball on chossing Wentworth as an affiliate. I will never recommend them to anyone, no matter how good their rate is. IF I could give a zero star for this, I would."
2362,1,"Horrible experienceIt took over 2 months to do a ""streamline"" loan. The fees imposed on the loan were never explained to us and when asked about the fees we were never given the truth. I had to show the load docs to an outside party to get a clear explanation as to why the fees were outrageous. We were promised the late fees on our previous loan would be paid by Low VA Rates which they never paid. We were told we would be receiving checks at the close of the loan for thousands of dollars which turned out to be only hundreds. Communication in general was poor at its best. During closing, cost were added to the loan and when we asked about said cost, Dan our Loan Officer bold faced lied what the cost was for. We had to call the title company to get the truth. Using Low VA Rates to refinance was the worst possible decision to make. I caution anyone who calls Low VA Rates to make sure you know what your are getting involved in. This company is not out to help veterans, taking your money is the only thing they care about. The loan I was offered was going to put my family further in debt by over $10,000. Dan from Low VA Rates knew it was not going to help us, in fact it was going to put our timeline to gain equity further behind but that did not stop him from signing us up. DO NOT USE LOW VA RATES!!!"
2363,3,"After looking around online for VA mortgage companies, I received emails from this company. I looked at their page and decided that it seemed like a bad way to do business, so I did not contact the company. Their representative, Dave Stephens, called my cell phone number, and I let him know that I was not interested in his product, that I was going to go with a local company. He began a hard-sell conversation that put me off even more. So I told him I would think about it, just to get off of the phone. There were several more emails and calls, which I ignored/deleted. Today, I answered a call and told him that I had locked in a rate with a local company and he said, ""But don't you want the best rate."" I told him I was happy with the company I had, and as I was hanging up, he yelled, ""Good luck with your worst rate."" He was borderline rude on each call, but that was just over the top. He should have some people-skills training. If this is how this company requires their representatives to interact with potential customers, they need some training, too."
2364,3,I’m finding more and more unexpected negative surprises along the way...I’m locked into the loan now but there were several things not properly disclosed by representatives as well as the title company at time of close...I wish I would have just stayed with my old lender at least I knew what to expect.
2365,1,"I was very unsatisfied with this company, they charged me too much on my closing costs, my balance went up $12000 more, I would submit them info they needed to do my refinance but they woudnt follow up sometimes with me. Most of the time were not very helpful at all! I will never use this service again or recommend anyone!!! this company does not help veterans, except steal theyre money!! I give them an F grade!"
2366,1,"Low VA rates was so unfamiliar with the process of refinancing a VA loan, my refinance was a tedious process. I had to personally contact the VA to confirm that I did not need a pest inspection. I had to personally contact the VA to confirm that I did not need a septic inspection. I would not recommend this company to veterans."

Michael Griswell (NMLS #133229) And his Loan Officer Patricia Smith (NMLS #1257033) lie to their customers first they will help you 100% I received an approval letter and we had an inspection done and a termite inspection done because we were going through the VA once we found out that we had to wait 6 months to get our house because Sam just opened his own company they have turned their back on us and have refused to give us back our inspection money and the termite inspection which is only $380 is there refusing to return my phone call they're refusing to do anything to help they're the ones who gave me the approval letter they're the ones who told me I had to have the inspection due to the fact that it is VA and now they refuse to answer any of my calls or any of my emails. Also their manager refuses to answer my calls or emails. I just want everyone to know in the future do not use this company they are liars and once that you do need something from them they refused to help."
2368,1,"Poor service delivery once they get your loan. Some customer representatives are better than others. Overall I have been extremely frustrated with their escrow department. I’ve requested o three occasions now for an escrow analysis. A couple weeks ago I was told that it would be ready on Tuesday, so I called on Wednesday to check on the status. You guessed it...it hadn’t been done. They ordered it again and indicated it would take a week so it would be ready by the end of the following week. I waited three days after they said it would be ready and guess what...still nothing. I asked to speak directly to the escrow department but was told they don’t talk to customers but he would send them an email (really an email...wouldn’t calling be faster I said, but his response was their procedure is to follow up with an email). He said he would ask them to expedite it so I should have something in less than a week. Ridiculous! It’s like pulling teeth to get this one thing done. I’ve had other experiences with them that left me feeling like a very unsatisfied customer. I can’t wait to payoff the loan and not have to deal with Planet Homelending Mortgage Company. I would never recommend them to anyone."
2369,1,"We have our loan through Planet Home Lending. We decided to do a refinance. Our initial person we spoke to David was great! Things were going great until it was moved to the closing person. Dejuan. We were scheduled to close only to find out we also needed a water test. We had to pay the expedite fee $187 to get that done. Then we found out we needed to get some paperwork from the Military statingy hubby is employees even after we provided 3 months of statements. We have never had to provide these documents and we have closed on 3 houses before this one. Every time we turned around there was something new that was needed or that we had to. None of which we were informed about initially. They sent someone to our house to close and she was an hour late. After talking with her it was because the company was late getting her the paperwork. And to add insult to injury they ended up taking out the next months payments from our checking account, still waiting on that to be returned. Good luck if you want to go with these people. They have NO idea what they are doing!

2370,1,"Name of the company should be Pathetic Hopeless Liars. We were forced to accept this company when previous mortgage company sold our mortgage to them. We had some financial problems, but our loan is up to date with them and they will not allow us to payments electronically, instead returning them to our bank a week after submitting it. Additionally one of the payments was lost and they used the convenient scapegoat, the USPS to blame, had to pay 35.00 to stop payment and send another check. In August after changing homeowners insurance a refund check was sent to cover escrow, never has been deposited. Allstate sent a check directly to them on Sep 12, and it has still not cleared. We have tried sending our concerns, received a reply, but no further action. So now our escrow is short and property taxes are coming due. My recommendation is to avoid this company altogether no matter what the positive reviews say."
2371,1,If i could give a negative below zero rating star I would without a second thought. Poor customer service .each person tells you something different. Very rude. They will ask that you dont record them so no one knows they talk horribly to the client but yet they dont want to be. Agents with poor customer phone skills ..They often refuse to take your payment then want to talk mean . Avoid this place at all cost if you are read in this review . if your thinking of using them as a lender ..you will regret it. My loan was sold to them. And it is the worst thing.. they asked me not to record them. . they are frauds and horrible. I will from here on out call higher authorities on them on any other instances of harrassment. Treating their clients so bad and not caring one bit... The poor records and dont document well . I think in have has one person who was any good at all. It is almost like they hired immature teens on the phone who they picked up off the street to work for them Its truly sad and they have poor ratings. More horrible than good ones .dont be fooled by the fake reviews they post.
2372,1,"A commercial loan company, NOT an advocate for Veterans. Approaching a month after alleged closing date, which was postponed for redundant paperwork, while my wife and I are now broke with delay costs (truck rental & $100/day contact extensions,storage, more movers for storage). If I needed a commercial processor with no initiative to help Vets,I should have gone to a more reputable track record. Be cautious Vets, they're just another commercial step in the for profit gauntlet. Stay Clear."
2373,1,"Veterans First called my mom to get a refinance on her home and talked her into a refinance to lower bills and get her credit better. I explained to them that she was moving at the time because of her disabilities and had to relocate to an area with better health facilities so we were not interested in the refinance. They coerced her into it anyways and now there is no equity in her home and is stuck here with her health declining. Veterans First is a Predafile lender and would not recommend them to anyone and to stay clear of these people at all cost. So thanks, Veterans First for ruining my moms life and the rest of our family, really appreciate it!!!!!"
2374,3,"I did not have a good experience with Veterans First. I was purchasing a manufactured home. 1,500 sq ft nice home.After 4 weeks they decided they couldnt do a new modular home because it it wasnt delivered and set.I understand them not wanting to do a manufactured home, But why did they have to wait over 4 weeks to tell me that?The final straw was they were silent the last 9 days, after several calls and emails I sent to agent and his supervisor was I informed of this."
2375,1,Veterans First continued to call my number until I answered. I requested to stop being contacted. The rep gave me the sales script and requested to do a soft inquiry. I told her that under no condition was a hard inquiry to be done for this would affect my score.I was informed on my credit report that a hard inquiry was conducted by CBC for Veterans First Mortgage. I contacted the VFM rep to file a complaint and was told by her that no inquiry was done. She Lied and I will be filing a formal complaint against VFM.
2376,3,"I was pre-approved quick and easily, found a home went through all the inspections and appraisals, I was told on Friday May 31 2019 that we were set to close on Friday June 7 2019 I was told by Tyler Gaisford that my loan had cleared underwriting with the condition that I walk away from my home that I was currently buying on contract. So knowing that this was the only condition that the underwriter needed I did so on June 1 2019 only to be called on Wednesday June 5 2019 to be told that I had lost funding from them, not really being told anything else and very confused by the situation I called another lender. The new lender requested some information from Veterans First on Monday June 10 2019, that is when they called me to say the underwriter now says that I need to wait 3 months to Close, this has put me homeless and they expect me to stay homeless for another 3 months, it put the sellers in a bad spot because they moved out and got an apartment after being told we were closing on the 7th. The only thing I can say is to record your phone calls with them as I have done. After speaking with a few attorneys and playing the recordings I have they informed me that what they did is a violation of law and they will be seeking some kind of settlement for far more than what I was going to borrow. I hate to do this but there was no remorse for making a person homeless from this company."
2377,1,"Extremely unprofessional. Lost some of my paperwork, kept telling me different things every other day. The underwriter I worked with was useless. If they needed something of mine from loan officer would ask me to call them and ask them instead of walking down hall to get it. Would never tell anyone to go here.

2378,1,"Overall we had a very disappointing experience with Premium Mortgage. Our first representative, Julie Wilde, was extremely poor at communicating with us, going one point 2 full weeks without returning multiple phone calls and emails. Then she left the company without notice. Honestly I don't know what happened, but I would not feel bad if she were fired. I feel like we got a very poor interest rate, after we were promised ""we will call you frequently when the rate goes down"" We were allowed one switch if the rate went down, I'm sure it did between the time we locked in and when we closed but Premium was never interested in working with us once we signed up. In hindsight, the whole concept of selling our loan to another bank after closing proves we weren't getting a good deal. I would never use a third party like this again, and would instead deal directly with a bank. By the time we realized we should switch, we were too far into the process to back out. I would NEVER use Premium again, and would not recommend them to anyone."
2379,2,"Getting this mortgage was an absolute nightmare! There was very little to no communication at all between the employees at Premium Mortgage. It was a complete joke! I was asked for the same paystubs at least 4 different times, they kept losing them every time along with many other items I sent them numerous times. They lost everything I sent them at least 3-4 times. They switched loans on me 4 days before I was due to close on my house almost leaving me homeless!! If I wasn't able to get in an early at my new house I really woukd have been homeless! They are absolutely horrible and I will never deal with Premium Mortgage again or send anyone to them!! I would call and call and I would never get a return phone call back. Buying and selling a house is stressful enough and getting this loan from Premium didn't help with that at all. I would give 0 zero stars to rate Premium but the minimum was 1."
2380,1,"We will NEVER use Premium Mortgage again! They would never return our calls, emails, or texts. Our mortgage guy Dylan Randall even blew us off and didn't even show up to the appointment we had scheduled with him. We had the WORST experience with this company and you couldn't even pay me to use them again next time we purchase a house. Do yourself a favor and go with someone else. It will save you a lot of tears and stress!!!!"
2381,1,"Is this review even going to be read? Anyway, I was repearedly assured that my house closing would be on the twenty second of September, which was a Friday. Friday...Saturday...Sunday...came and went. Not one word from a single person until late Monday morning. I took off from work to get everything moved in during this timeframe, instead I got to sit here on my hands. When I told the individual that I took off for the move, they said that I really shouldnt have done that. Are you serious? As if buying a house is something that someone does once a week. So I hope whoever was responsible for this nonsense had a terrific weekend because I will never recommend Premium Mortgage to anyone."
2382,2,"I contacted your AAG over a week ago, gave them a great deal of personal information and was told I would be called back by 3:00PM the same day. I haven't heard a word from them since. Not to surprised......this is the kind of service that is associated with Reverse Mortgages. Rest assured any business I might do in the future certainly won't be with this company!Andrew M."
2383,3,"My issue is more with the individual assigned to my account than with AAG itself. Once the initial application was signed, my account manager would not take nor return calls unless I contacted her supervisor. It became very obvious very soon that my ""representative"" was only interested in selling and was not at all interested in answering questions or making the process in any way easier for me. I feel as if I was taken advantage of and thought seriously about cancelling the entire deal."
2384,1,Loan fraud made easy! You approved a loan knowingly to family members who not only do not live here but have never spent the night in my home! Your inspector came to verify residence of the house to find that they do not live here yet you still gave them a reverse mortgage! The house does not even meet FHA standards and yet you still pushed the reverse mortgage through!!! Our home was purchased outright and now we owe you.
2385,3,"The lady that was the lead person at AAG on my loan was very nice, helpful and stayed in communication with me during the process. On the down side, I eventually felt that there was a lack of communication between her and other people at AAG working on my account. I had a tax lien on the house and was told that (for some reason) the lien was not attached to the house and they would not have to pay it off at closing. Then later I was told that they would have to pay it off at closing. Also, I was told that everything was done and the closing process would begin. Then I was called by another person wanting to know when I retired. What difference did this make? Then she wanted me to prove that my wife had cancer. She wanted me to prove that my health insurence from eight years ago was $2,500 per month. Not many people keep paid bills for eight years.The amount of money we were to receive at closing varied widely from $27,000 then $15,000 then $7,500 - we finally received $2,500.It seemed as if they didn't know what they were doing but in the end it all worked out fine."
2386,3,"I called twice about a week between calls. Both times I was told that the computer system was down. I was told that they could answer general questions but couldn’t access my account. My first impression is that AAG’s priority is selling loans, not servicing them. As a new client I find this very disconcerting."
2387,3,They Pretend to operate with the best intentions but actually ignore them to get money. They once issued a penalty notice for non-payment and demanded £4500 to be paid for my residential mortgage loan. It has not exactly been the best option for me not until I met Christine. She helped me in clearing off my £4500 and also helped me out with a credit bureau hack. Other services I know she renders is getting Clients some loan offers without any collateral. I will say this has been the best. christinerecoverysolution@gmail(dot)com%%Replace dot with .
2388,3,"I was late once, and then few months later served foreclosure notice. I had auto pay from account set up, it paid every month, but they were returning my payments, not accepting them. Those returned payments are the reason they foreclosed. No sense. I did not know pymnts were being returned. Anyway, filed ch13 bk to save house, payment plan was set and made payments as planned and they began accepting mortgage payments again. This was march 2018. In dec. I was told the bk was cancled, out of blue. I had been paying bk to court send i thought bk was all set. Anyway, contacted MSF regarding situation and said to continue reg payments, then was later told payment went up, so stayed paying higher amount. Anyhow, been making my payments every month, then yesterday got a 3 day notice to vacate on my door?? I am so completely lost. I don't know wth is going on. House was appraised at 180,000.

2389,1,"Mortgage solutions financial cheated us out of our family home. So what happened was. My mother passed away in 2017 and she left the will to me for her house. The houses current value is 300k. I called mortgage solutions financial and talked about my situation and ask if I could get a loan to pay off the remaining balance so that I could keep the house. They said for me to give them all my docs which I did and they wanted my debt card to charge for a appraisal. I gave it to them. They returned back with a pre approval and they told us were good to go. They asked for a few more docs and I gave it to them they again said ""we are golden to close"" they sent docs to title. They fax docs to the bank that own the remaining balance. We were all set. There was a deadline to close by the bank or foreclosure. Mortgage solutions financial said were good. 3 days before closing they fired the loan officer who was working on our case with out telling anyone. So were all hear at closing and they never showed and we got voicemail. This cause us to get our home foreclosed on. So now were are taking them to court to ask for the balance between what was owed to its current value plus sentimental value of 200k. So my lawyer and I are asking the court for a total of .

2392,1,"My wife and I have been on several other wine tours in different wine countries similar to the Platypus Tours. Our experience with Platypus was average at best. Our driver was friendly and took us from point to point, but there was very little insight or commentary along the way. We went to 4 wineries: Cosentino, Benessere, Varozza, and David Fulton. Benessere and Varozza were very interesting and informative about their wines and history. The other wineries seemed to be selected more out of convenience and did not provide the ambiance expected from other quality wineries in the area. With the amount of wineries in Napa, we were expecting Platypus Tours to have a better insight and access to the many beautiful wineries. The next day, we toured on our own and realized how much better the tour could have been. Overall, I would be hesitant to recommend the Platypus Tours."
2393,3,"Tour guide wasn't the best, seemed very stuck up and not approachable. Not a great pick of wineries either...I didn't go to Napa valley to try a wine called ""bromance"" that is draped with fake dog tags and seems to mock the men and the women who serve this country."
2394,3,Driver was upset with our friends tip which did not seem professional. We also would have liked to seen some larger wineries not just smaller family owned ones. The wineries we went to by our self we were able to choose from a list of wines but on this tour you had to start with a Chardonnay which I do not drink so I was out one taste. I feel we would have been better off going on our own.
2395,3,"There were 4 wineries in 8 hours!! It was very slow with little time at each winery except the one we had lunch at. This seemed inefficient considering we spent 8 hours (most of it on a bus). The tour guide kept promising we would have ""so much fun, drink so much wine, etc"" and that was not the case at all. We were dissapointed."
2396,1,"Platypus doesn't provide any tours of wineries on the ""wine tour"" vans. We were taken to obscure wineries for tasting only which we could have done on our own and at much better wineries. Our driver was in a bad mood which got worse when she found out she was no longer being employed by Platypus during our trip. She gave my husband some grief about not buying enough wine (even though he had purchased two cases at the first place). Why should it matter to her? Does she get a percentage? And their van doesn't have seats but benches along the wall, so you have to keep turning to look over your shoulder to see out the window. We used a different company on another day and they were SO MUCH better (Grapeline). We do not recommend Platypus. Luckily, we had a good group of folks on our trip which made it tolerable."
2397,2,"I will never purchase from them again. I have purchased wine online for years, and never had a problem. This wine seller does not make clear the size of their bottles. I purchased a dozen Roth Cabernet 2 months ago from the seller I typically deal with at $20 per 750 bottle, They were out when I went to repurchase, so thought I'd try Saratoga. The price was just below $19 per bottle ... The fact that it was a 375ml bottle was not clear enough. Either there was an intention to deceive, or the wine from this seller is way over marked. Either way, I don't want to deal with them."
2398,3,"I ordered the Master Distiller's No. 3 from Jack Daniel's. The bottle arrived but was missing the limited edition box it comes with. I am trying to find a time to contact customer service for the return but I am in meetings back-to-back each day so it's difficult to do this. I have 2 minutes between a meeting so I decided to quickly fill out this survey.

2399,3,"I was unimpressed with Saratoga Wine. I ordered a case of wine that was marked as being on sale. A few days later I was notified by the company that the sales price was a misprint and they would be unable to sell me the wine at the price advertised and confirmed by email. Instead of fighting them and wasting time and energy, I ordered the same wine from a different company and asked them to deliver the other part of my order. Two days later a bottle of wine arrived from Saratoga Wine. I had assumed it was a bottle of wine as a sort of apology for their mistake. The next day, Fed Ex contacted me to notify me that my shipment was cancelled. Come to find out, the bottle delivered to my address was mistakenly sent by Saratoga Wine and they were asking for Fed Ex to retrieve the bottle before delivering the case of wine I had ordered. The whole experience of course took time to sort the mess out on the phone with Fed Ex. I am thoroughly unimpressed and do not view this organization as organized nor professional."
2400,3,requested audience with manager many times and NEVER heard back from him.wrong wines sent and company insisted that i return them at at my expense.return policy DOES NOT COVER OR MENTION this type of situation when it should state that the co.will correct its errors AT ITS EXPENSE. customer should be able to reply to any and all emails and not have to look for a different email address in order to respond.this caused a number of problems.
2401,3,"I ordered a case of wine for a Valentines Day gift. I made it clear I wanted it by then. I was then told you were short one of the bottles and because of bad weather you would not get it in time. I asked if you could substitute it for another bottle and was told no. So the case came late and you didn't even have the original bottle I waited for but a much cheaper one! Why a substitution could not have been made so that I could have received this gift on time is not clear. Bad customer service or you should have more wine on hand for such situations.

2402,1,"I have booked Canadian maple syrup on market view liquor. The website showed the bottle is 750ml per bottle. But they finally sent the 375ml per bottle!! And I asked why the difference, they never replied!! I think they cheat on the website."
2403,3,"I ordered a case of 2011 cab and received a 2012. I called and explained that the wrong wine was sent to me. They said oh we ran out.That's non sense, dont advertise product that you do not have. This wine does not have the same flavor!"
2404,3,"I ordered a bottle of brugal about two weeks ago and still haven't gotten it. When I try to use the link in the email to track it, it shows that the account doesn't exist. I know I ordered it and paid for it because I have the emails and the charges on my card."
2405,3,We did not receive our order. Tracking showed that it was delivered to a citizen in a different state...or else the tracking info was wrong. We intend to call Marketview Liquor about this. We ordered from them twice before without trouble.
2406,3,While Marketview Liquor initially responded fast and the order was shipped. I received an e-mail advising me that the order was damaged while in route. I ordered this item in November and I still have not received it. So what type of review do you think I should give.
2407,3,"They advertised wine they didn't have. I ordered a bottle off of their website, paid for it, and was then contacted to say that the specific vintage was not actually in their inventory.I responded to ask if another vintage was available, and if so, what year was it, and the response was that they didn't have the wine at all. Merely listing the wrong vintage would be a 2-star rating; not having it at all is a 1-star, at best. They did refund my transaction, but that should go without saying."
2408,1,Cellaraiders had a good selection of wines I was looking at for a good price so it seemed like a good fit. They were easy to work with but the first problem I had with them is they tell you that the company will get a hold of you regarding shipping charges. That is actually not the case as they billed me for shipping on UPS which i didn't want and never contacted me on any options. I had to call to change the shipping co. and they never bothered to send any tracking info afterwards. The second problem I had with them is they never had any interest in warning me that where they were sending wine from a place that had freezing temperatures. I live in California so I had no idea where these people were located and their weather situation. Well two of the wines arrived with popped out corks and when I called them about it they said to send pictures. They then emailed me later that they doesn't know what to say but to drink them quickly at this point. He then said it was my fault for not holding the wine even though there is no notice on the website stating this as an option. To send out 100 dollar wines like this and then blame the customer for the mistake is in my mind a company I would not recommend anyone due business with.
2409,2,"Charging nearly 20 dollars for shipping without any warning is deplorable. Will not be ordering again. Shipping needs to be agreed upon beforehand. Worst possible way to run a company. Broke student as is, now an extra 20 gone after spending over 50? Terrible."
2410,3,"Order shipment promised for Thursday. Order did not ship until Monday. No tracking or shipment confirmation provided, just a receipt for my credit card being charged a shipping fee. Scrambling for a last minute Valentines Day gift for the wife as the wine will not arrive on time."
2411,3,1985 las casas purchased from Ben. He later responded there was an error and he did not have the wine<U+0001F974> offered refund or pick something else out from his list. I just had this happen with Vinfolio for 1990 Montrose. They said they would try to source it. Wonder what others are seeing with this online purchase of older wine.
2412,2,"Published 6 days agoWe joined Naked Winery 3 years agoWe joined Naked Winery 3 years ago. When we first joined we got fantastic service at the Bend location. And by service I mean every time we went in there for a tasting, we got a detailed education and explanation for each wine we had. Over the last year and half, that service disappeared. We barely got spoken too. Further, we use to able to take in as many friends/family as we wanted in for a tasting or a glass of wine and some snacks...now that has been limited to just 4 people and ONLY tastings (no glass of wine instead of a tasting). We just feel the service and what you got with your membership originally isn't what it was when signed up. Too bad...it was a nice place to hang out in the Old Mill District.Naked WineryReply from Naked WineryPublished 4 hours agoThank you for your review. Our goal is to wow every guest, but unfortunately we must have fallen short. Sorry if you were mislead on number of free tastings per visit - in the membership contract you sign it states complimentary tasting for groups of four at any of our Tasting Rooms & Events. We have passed your review feedback along to the management team. Thank you again for your many years of support as a Club Naked member. Please feel free to contact us with any other comments you have. Thank you.From Michelle and John:So your reply basically implies that I didn't read the small print when we signed up 3 years ago. Yes, that's true. But your sales staff in Bend verbally told us what the deal was 3 years ago. And for a year and half on multiple occasions we took more than 4 people in there at a time and they provided a tasting or glass of wine with no questions asked to everyone we brought in. Further, this is how we got introduced to the wine club as we too were guest of members. We thought was a good deal and decided to sign up for ourselves. Your half-hearted apology doesn't mean much when you add in a comment about not reading the fine print. It comes across as ""sorry but not sorry"". This just confirms to me that dropping our membership was a good idea since the customer service is no longer what it used to be!"
2413,3,Merlot was almost vinegar. Chardenay was flat with no body. Blush was not sweet as advertised...bad after taste. Either wine was not properly cold packed or wine is just quality. When I did receive it...cold packs we're warm.Had others taste test my results and we all agree. Again...not sure what the cause was but would repurchase any of these choices. Sadly...a waste of a lot I money on dull flavored vinegar.
2414,2,"Had a $100 coupon and got 6 bottles of wine and still owed $90. Received the box and had only 2 different kinds of wine , which I thought they would have had 6 different kinds. I could have went to the store and picked out some I really would have enjoyed.Never again will I use one of those coupons :(."
2415,2,"How can I enjoy my wine if it cant even be delivered...?? So disappointed in the delivery method, never left a time they would try to redeliver, never left information on when and where I could pick it up. So sad that i have to go through this for the next year, cant wait to cancel because of a silly thing such as delivery issue."
2416,3,"I am pretty disappointed. I ordered it for my best friend who was turning 50 in December. They assured me she would get it for her birthday, which was my main concern because I was to be out of the country on her actual birthday. The delivery never came because they said it broke in transit. She also had no info about who sent her the gift. Now she is waiting for her January order, in which they said she will get double the quantity. So much for sending what I thought would be a quality gift."
2417,1,"While the marketing of the special value bottles of wine was good, the wine I received was Walmart quality wine. I would NEVER buy this wine, yet I fell prey to sharp marketing tactics and bought a lot of it. Tempted to dump it down the drain or just throw it away as I wouldn't even GIVE this wine away to anyone I know."
2418,3,Your delivery company GSO is the worst. We have been waiting a week for our wine. They attempted to deliver once in that time according to their website but no notification was left. I cannot tell you how unhappy I am considering we are paying a premium for this service. You need to use someone else if you want me to continue ordering through WOM. I have been very loyal to you but the constant delays and high cost of shipping are making me rethink patronage.
2419,3,"I bought a subscription for my Dad on Fathers Day. They have been sending too many emails since my purchase. Each time I click “unsubscribe” I get directed to a website which displays this error: ""The given key was not present in the dictionary."" No idea what that means. I wouldn’t have bought this if I knew there was no way to unsubscribe from their emails."
2420,2,"I was very very disappointed with Wine of the Month service. I ordered 12 bottles of champagne to be delivered to business clients on Dec 13, 2018 with the expectation that they would be received by clients by Christmas. Delivery for some clients did not take place till just before New Years and some clients have still not received delivery (end of January, 2019). Shipping details were not made clear to me at time of order; by the time I found out about the delivery schedule it was too late for me to make other arrangements. Will not be returning to them for future orders."
2421,1,"This is a joke from the word buy. I paid over $100 for a bunch of substandard, didn't pass quality control standards over produced wine that they are trying to cut their losses on. NOT one bottle was worth drinking, and yes it has only been a few days since I purchased/received the order I opened all but 3 of the 18 bottles trying to find one that was palatable. Not only do they send you nasty wine, but they charge you shipping and a membership fee, if you want to cotinue with receiving the wines. In my case they could pay me and I would still not want to be a 'MEMBER' . If ""Splash wines"" Would like to have new, consistent orders, they need to #1 allow free shipping on your first purchase whether it be from their own website or one that they advertise on (for example Groupon), forget the membership fees, (They aren't Costco for sure and don't offer wholesale pricing for ""members"") everyone pays the same amount, there is not instinctive to join their membership program because you still get the same substandard wine, which you can buy locally for 1/2 or less of the price they charge. If you want some Maddog 20/20 go to your local store and buy it as it about the same quality of what you get here on Splash wines. A big waste of money and time in my opinion and will not be ordering from them again. I will not pay a membership to get this quality of wine. I will be however sending reports of my experience to ripoff.com, pissedconsumer .com and local/state authorities and the BBB as getting products not as described."
2422,2,"I ordered a case of 18 South African 2016 Radford Dale Cabernet. This is a spectacular wine, when stored properly. This consignment however was really cheap. I should have known. I also then had to pay an extra +-30 bucks shipping to on top. It arrived, I tasted, We now have 18 bottles of very expensive cooking wine, it was OFF. Never again, Splash Wines you dirty swines."
2423,2,ordered a groupon which I've done with many other wine companies in the past... would not order again even if it was for free. Every bottle of white wine tasted the same and every bottle of red wine tasted the same and neither was good... I'm convinced that it's the same one blend of white wine and one blend of red wine with different labels... very disappointing!
2424,3,I was never sent notification that it had shipped. The only notification I received that it was delivered. The bottom of the box was falling out so it was delivered upside down. The bottle holder packing was all broken on the bottom of the bottles. It is amazing that none of the bottles broke. Will have to think long and hard before purchasing from Splash Wines again.
2425,1,"The wine I was sent was garbage, complete garbage. I received 5 bottles of three different wines. A chardonnay, a white, and a verdego. They were all unpalatable. I emailed the company about the variety and taste and they never responded. Not worth the money at all. I've had $3 wine that tasted better than this bottom of the barrel toilet waste."

Message de plainte :
On May 22nd I ordered two boxes of red wine from Vivino, to try them out. 
Four different times I received emails saying the delivery ""would take place tomorrow"". Absolutely nothing arrives and I do not receive a call or a note from Vivino or their delivery company.
I call customer support and while they are incredibly patronising, they basically say the problem is with the delivery company and they will call me back when they have spoken with the delivery company (Parcel Force).
I never receive a call back from Vivino Customer Support. I have to chase them.
After 3 weeks I call Vivino Customer Support to cancel the order and request a refund.
A refund is promised - but a week later: absolutely no refund and certainly no delivery.
Poor delivery service, with an indifference that is only exceeded by the patronising Customer Service."
2428,1,"Absolutely the worst customer service! Do not order wine from Vivino.I saw several reviews of ""bait and switch"" and I have to agree! This is exactly what happened to me. Trust me, they aren't doing this by mistake. The vintage they are sending is much cheaper and NOT what you ordered!Vivino tried to tell me that they can substitute for a different year. There was absolutely nothing on my receipt or packing slip that states this. I sent them a copy. (Vivino requested this to show them, as if they don't have the same copy?)Good luck getting in touch with customer service as well. When you finally do, they drag it on forever and it's like pulling teeth for them to do anything to help you.I had to ask for a return label over 4 times and finally had American Express step in and get my money refunded. Vivino did absolutely nothing to make the return easy and I received no compensation for my hours of wasted time. I wish I could give Vivino 0 stars."
2429,2,Search for a 2009 and you get a large picture of the 2009 bottle but small print changes it to 2013. There is also no options for shipping and everything comes UPS. Not good and they lost me as a customer.
2430,1,"Can I give a ZERO!!! Horrible, terrible, atrocious - there aren't enough accurate, derogatory words (that will make it past the trust pilot censors!) to describe these buffoons!! I cancelled my membership after the first shipment of mediocre, over-priced wine many months ago. Still - I get a charge last month for $185. Ok, mistakes happen. But they proceed to send me on a month-long rabbit hole of customer support half-truths (contact PayPal, we've done what we can... blahblah) only to find out they are EFin buffoons who in my opinion steal. Yes, steal- sue me if you think it's libel you freakin thieves! Terrible wine! Terrible service!! DO NOT JOIN THIS CLUB OF THIEVES AND (in my opinion) LIARS!"

Of the first 6 bottles opened, we couldnt finish any of them. They were disgusting.Never again !!!"

Seriously considering canceling my subscription and trying another club."

They say they issued a refund, but it was never received in my PayPal account. Now I'm having to deal with PayPal and my credit card just to get my money back. All Laithwaites Wine will do is make excuses and false promises. Join their wine club at your own risk...it's been a terrible experience for me, and a huge waste of my time."

I'll stick to my scotch and get wine from a legitimate company!!!"
2436,1,"Very, very shady business model. They rope you in with a great deal on a case but they don’t tell you that they’re gonna charge you 40 dollars every month and you’ll get nothing in return unless you go on the website, which now will not even allow me to log in. I have been scammed out of over $200 by this website and I hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else."
2437,1,did my best to use my coupon with out ant thing angel will not work they still add a angel discount which signs you up for the 40 a month i tried all the different wine after i put in code no deal it all says angel sign up and they are right no on line chat this my friend is a scam hoping you will not notice the 40 a month even it says is not required you can not order without the so called angel discount being attached no matter what they say.
2438,3,"Got a kick out of ""we don't auto ship"" that's for sure. The auto billing -- well that's a different story cause that goes on and on and on and on!!!Lucky we caught this early (auto billing) and have now stopped it (we hope) examples of why people seem to think you're a scam: just my recent experience #1. I went to use my account balance and ordered the Steak wine package for 141.00 - we had a 140.00 credit when i went to check out it placed over 300.00 billed with minus 140.00. So I emptied that cart. Next it said get 2 extra bottle for $16.??-- it didn't say each-- it said 2 for $16.?? and by the time I caught it the check out was done. Warning; be cautious before checking out. Lastly--- there is no account number-- just billing statement so you can't reference anything to CC company or wine people. Sure that is by design. YES they do send out notice-- it's been going to my wife's email for 3 months-- disguised as wine advertisement as in purchase wine. Not you've been ""auto"" billed.FACEBOOK-- folks not everyone in the world is on facebook."
2439,1,"Naked wine's $100 voucher deal is a scam. Shame on them! This is a dishonest way to lure people in. Even with the voucher I still have to pay like $80. And when I try to order 6 bottles of the cheapest wine they've got, right under $100, the value of the voucher is $0. What a bunch of lairs! If I were to trade your stock I would only short it!"
2440,1,Please please do not buy ANY wine from this company! It is a complete scam. They sign you up for a “wine club” with $25 bottle of disgusting wine. I signed for the shipment without knowing what it was and got stuck with (unless I paid for shipping to return plus a restocking fee) 6 bottles of the grossest wine I’ve ever had. Save yourself the headache of ordering any wine from this company! I spent 3 months disputing it with my credit card company and only won one of my two disputes. I’m also dropping my credit card company.
2441,1,Huge ripoff. Sucks you in with a deal and then renews membership in clubs with no notice or way to cancel after order is “processing”. Got screwed out of $144 for six bottles of mediocre wine and am waiting for a $111 order that says it includes two bottles. Never doing business here again and I recommend you don’t start. WSJ wine club is by far better.
2442,1,I give them a one star since you can't give them a zero. I went around all the phone calls and said no more withdrawals from my checking account. I thought I was sending a check in for a box of wines and did not know I was being enrolled in a wine club. I did not know you could do this without giving authorization to the bank but I guess it was in the fine print. Also I was not aware I was going to be charged $146 for 6 bottles of wine that I did not order a month later. I was disappointed with those wines because there was only 3 different ones. At $24.00 a bottle I don't think so. I usually can figure out a scam but they got me on this one.
2443,3,"I joined in August and then tried to cancel but they are hard core sellers and don't give you an option to cancel so I told them to hold off for 6 months. They then shipped a case to my old address without notifying me that they were shipping it. It was returned by the person currently living at me old address. Vinesse never contacted before the shipment or after the shipment was returned. However they charged my account and did not credit me for the returned shipment. Then they went ahead and sent out another shipment, again to an address where I no longer live. Again, did not notify me and charged my account. Now they want to charge me a restocking fee. Awful disgusting company to deal with. Woman I spoke with was rude. I only gave them one star since I couldn't give no stars."
2444,3,"It is quite disappointed to their services. I have called them 2 times and the lines were disconnected for what kind of reason I don't know. The incident is that I have 2 new order accounts, one is under my husband's name, one is under my name for my son's wedding. He is going to marry, he has new house but not yet move in, so I order the wine for him and the delivering address is the same address that my husband's order address. They denied my mileages that Vinesse Supposed to offer for me as the advertising posted in united.com web page. I have checked the term and condition and the limitation are not posted and declared there. After I found out the mileages are not yet posted to my account. I called them they said one household one offer. I told them it is for my son, I order for him because it is secured for you Vinesse the wines will not be lost during the delivery. I can check the deliveries as I am a stayhome mom They even changed my American wine club account information and withdraw my wine club account.I am thinking about you Vinesse the best but as a result I have got the services out of my expects. I hope the customer service supervisors can help me to solve the problem. And I hope you can do what you said 100% satisfaction guarantee services.Thank you for attention."
2445,3,"I purchased a gift certificate as a Christmas present that is to be emailed to me. Filled out credit card info and the order was processed online. I received notification of the order but no gift certificate and order showing payment still needed to be processed before they would email gift certificate, but they wouldn't process the payment. So I called three times and emailed them twice. No one will return calls or emails. Crazy!"
2446,1,"Buyer beware! I searched for a certain 12 year bourbon whiskey that Finewinehouse had on their website. I check that I did not want a substitution to call me if they didn't have any more. I received not what I ordered but a special reserve bourbon from the same distillery and was charged $79.95 plus my fedex charge of $24.58. I can go to my local liquor store and buy this W.L. Weller Special Reserve for $24.95 a bottle. So not only was I sent the wrong bottle but I was overcharged $55 for the bottle. When I called, they said that I ordered the special reserve (which I did not). I could send it back & they would refund for the bottle but not the shipping either way - $45+ for nothing. This was supposed to be a gift for my father - a fantastic & special bourbon. Instead, I will keep my $24.95 bottle of bourbon that I was taken for $105 ($79.95 + $24.58 to get it to my dad for his birthday). If you do choose to purchase through them, be sure to take a screen shot of your order in case you don't get what you order too. Really bad experience both on the ordering & the customer service. Thanks Matt for your ""help""."
2447,1,"Order a case of 2008 Chardonnay, they confirmed, processed the order and shipped...one case of 2009. Interestingly, they provided an invoice in the box for 2008 but 12 bottles of 2009. I guess they thought they could sell me something similar. When I called to complain they refused to issue credit. They explained the 2009 was better than the 2008. Avoid this joke of a wine retailer. They will use any tactic to take your money. Worse wine retail experience that I have ever had. I buy 100s of cases of wine a year."
2448,2,"These guys have a lot to learn about customer retention. I ordered 6 bottle of wine on Dec 21st so that I would have it for NYE party. I called a week later and was told that it would ship soon. An attempted delivery was made on Dec 28th but I had no knowledge of it (no email was received) and I had to call their shippers (Golden State Overnight) to try and re-schedule. They told me it would be re-delivered on Dec 31st between 8am and 4pm. I stayed home all day. Never got the wine. After hours of being put on hold and lied to by GSO I finally was told that they damaged the package and sent it back to the shipper (Fine wine house). Fine wine house refunded me for the original shipment and were willing to re-send me the bottles if I pay for them in full and offer me a credit of $15 for shipping charges. Sorry, but when you ruin somebody's New Year's Eve, a little bit more than free shipping would have been more appropriate. I didn't ask for free wine but a deeply discounted price for all the trouble and time I went through trying to track my shipment (with no help from Fine Wine!) would have been a decent apology and perhaps keep me as a future customer. Its called the cost of doing business. Instead, they would rather have a bad review which in the long run will cost them more. Oh well............................ Happy New Year!"
2449,2,f I had -5 stars? I'll check them all but I got to check at least one to be able to write this review with that said HORRIBLE!!! I will never try to order from this place again never! now go ahead and keep the hold on my card hope that helps you sleep better at night . Very very disappointed.
2450,3,Your website is the problem. I’ve been clicking “Place Order” over and over and getting an error message each time. Please don’t send me 7 repeats of the same order!!!I can only assumed that my order has been placed since I’m being asked to write a review. Please send help!
2451,2,"I ordered three bottles of Mead. They arrived in the time they estimated, but when I opened the box, two of three bottles had leaked. It was not much, but if the Mead came out it means air got in. I have pictures to show their arrival condition. I haven’t tried any yet, but the flavor probably suffered because of it. I think I will find a more local source that I can drive to next time."
2452,3,"I placed an order for a case on April 10, and then 9 days later, was informed by email that they only had 10 bottles and no means to order more. I said, ""Okay, process it."" I wish they would have sent what they had to begin with and not waited.A few days go by, and no wine. I call to share my frustration in a voice mail that the order is still delayed and that it will now arrive after Easter. I ask for someone to please contact me. They don't.While out of town for Easter, I get an email stating the shipment was finally made and will arrive on Saturday while we're out of town visiting family. It must be signed for by an adult.On Monday, April 22, I'm sure to be home all day so I can sign for the shipment. No delivery happens. I call GSO to get an update. They don't know where it is and why it's not been delivered. They will call me back. They do, and ask if I got it. ""No, why don't you know that?""It's Tuesday and I've received no window for delivery and call GSO. They don't know when it will be delivered. It maybe got misplaced. I call GSO again in the evening at 5:30pm because I need to get to the supermarket. GSO thinks it might be delivered. They will call me back. No one calls. I call back at 6:40pm. They tell me it will come between 6:55 and 7:25pm. ""But, aren't your delivery windows between 8am and 5pm?"" I ask the rep. Yes, but we get behind and you were outside the window. It arrives just after 7pm.Now, you might be thinking that Napacabs shouldn't be held accountable for GSO. However, if they would have only a) processed the partial order way earlier, or b) contacted me about the shipment as asked, all this could have been avoided. It took from April 10 to April 23 to get my order from a store located 90 minutes drive away. Oh, and I didn't get the 10 bottles they told me about in the email. I only received 9 bottles. Ha!"
2453,3,"Decent experience, but website needs to be more searchable. Customer needs to be able to enter multiple search terms into the engine and have it narrowed down. For example, enter the words Pinot Noir and 90 points and just get Pinots over 90 points. The current search engine is a bit primitive for a site of Napacabs' popularity and ambition."
2454,2,"Bought Game of Thrones wine for a GOT series finale party. I paid over $40 for 2 day shipping on a Wednesday and did not receive the wine until Monday which was one day too late. I wish they would’ve communicated the expected delivery date so that I wouldn’t have wasted so much money on gimmicky wine that serves no purpose after the party or either that would’ve opted for 1 day delivery. Luckily, I was able to find the wine on the day of the party at World Market. Will NEVER order from Napacabs again."
2455,1,"Beware of billing discrepancies. On our last order with wine.com, they over-billed us by $40 more than the receipt showed. When we reached out to complain, they claimed it was an error. But errors seem to happen a lot with this company, so beware and double check your statements."
2456,3,"This is a company that is in the wine shipping business and they failed at shipping my wine. It was supposed to arrive at a Fedex store on Friday. However, Wine.com did not fill out the shipping label properly and so the fedex people did not know where to drop it off... They tried again Saturday, which did not happen. I called Wine.com and FedEx on Monday to let them know about the situation. The lady at Wine.com said she would refund me the shipping, she never did. Finally, on tuesday, when I learned that the package would be delayed yet another day, I called to let them know I was canceling. The Fedex folks were blaming the Wine.Com folks and the Wine.com folks were saying Fedex should figure it out...I'm left in the middle holding the bag."
2457,1,They will overload your mailbox with SPAM !! You will not be able to get rid of it. I have requested they stop spamming me at least 6 times. Somehow they can get around my spam blocker. I will seek other ways to warn the public about this annoying company.
2458,1,"This is by fast THE WORST company I’ve ever tried to do business with, I ordered everything and it never shipped. I called customer service only to be transferred 2-3 times to end up at a voicemail service and still get no help! I will never order through them angain nor would I suggest anyone to do it!!!"
2459,1,Stay away from this company !! They cannot get the most simple things correct and they load up your inbox with SPAM that Cannot be blocked. I have asked them four times to stop the spam but it keeps coming.
2460,1,"Partner ordered mothers day flowers well in advance of mothers day, the night before mothers day at 12am they sent a message saying 'is unable to fulfill your order due to low stock levels' and sorry about that here's a refund. He didn't actually see the email until mid Sunday, looking like he just forgot mothers day, had a very upset mother! I got onto them saying this was totally unacceptable and how disgraceful their service was!!!They apologised 'we're so sorry, as an apology we're sending you a voucher for the €52 you spenT' and all they did was refund his money he originally paid for the flowers!! This isn't resolved yet, I'm onto them complaining again, they said 'oh we're sending you the vouchers now' so they never actually sent him the first lot.Utter disgrace of a company!!!! As a florist you're only using them around sensitive subjects, birthdays, anniversaries, condolences etc.....for them to mess up so much and be so blasé about it is an utter disgrace!!! DONT USE THEM!!! USE YOUR LOCAL FLORIST!!!SORT YOUR COMPANY OUT INTERFLORA!!!"
2461,2,"I was regular customer. Every Valentines, every birthdays, every Christmas.... But NEVER AGAIN! Why?Last week I ordered flowers for my girlfriend - I wanted to apologize her. I paid 75$ and what? My girlfriend received withered, old weeds! ""Flowers"" were nasty and like from a horror!"
2462,1,"""Interflora S.p.a.: no satisfied, no refund!""here's what happened relying on this historic company for international flower deliveryHere's what can happen to you if you use Interflora Italia S.p.A. and their services of sale and delivery of flowers.On 2nd June 2015, I have placed an order on the Interflora website for a flower composition (i.e. some flowers plus their jar) that should have been delivered to a friend in England to be then brought to a cemetery and put on a tombstone for a commemoration - which would occur on the day after. On 3rd June, the friend just received a simple bunch of flowers, with no jar to contain them.I have then immediately contacted Interflora, asking to fix the error, by sending what I had actually purchased - mandatorily - within end of day on 3rd June or, in case this would not be possible, to be reimbursed as the item delivered was different than what I had purchased.In such occasion, I have also clearly stated that after 3rd June the flower composition would be useless, indicating that they should not re-send anything after that date.On 4th June, my friend in England has received the correct flower composition I had ordered on the website; it's a pity that it was useless on that day, as the commemoration was held on the day before.Despite my request for a refund, Interflora considers the matter settled and that nothing is still owed to me.So be careful when ordering from Interflora as you might receive a different item, the company might deliver late despite you tell them not to, nor they refund you.P. Malaguti."
2463,1,"Useless! Ordered flowers to be delivered today, for Valentines. All fine until 5 mins ago when I get an email saying ""We are sorry to advise you that, due to the high volume of orders, we are unable to deliver your order"". Phone up to complain, only to be told that they can't take my call due to large number of calls!Obviously no-one told Interflora that today was Valentines day, and therefore more people might be sending flowers......Totally and utterly disappointed with Interflora. All I can do is make sure I tell enough people to avoid them like the plague! Letting people down like this is 100% totally unacceptable.Poor show Interflora. Time to try one of your competitors I think."
2464,2,"Very disappointed. I had found a beautiful selection of flowers on a competitor's website but was unable to get a Sunday delivery slot. I only chose Interflora for that reason; such a shame. Paid an excessive amount for Sunday delivery and watched the tracking all day, which stated that the order was 'out for delivery'. Having not heard any positive comments from my mother I found out that nothing had arrived the following day. Not only do I look like I missed the date, but I have no idea where the order is as tracking now states 'no information'. They have, however, taken my money. What a terrible company and would recommend to avoid like the plague. 'At Interflora we aim to provide the highest quality service and delight every customer with each gift we deliver'- I am sure they do, but it has to be delivered first. I am hoping to get my money back soon and I will be using the other company that I should have in the first instance- they are cheaper too."
2465,1,"I felt so compelled to write this review. I have never written a bad review in my life, but because of the awful experience I have had, I felt as though you, the buyer, needed to read before purchasing from this company. I purchased a rug that cost roughly $800-900. The rug was not available at the time and so I needed to wait a few weeks to pick it up at a warehouse. After putting in my order for the rug, the company sent me an email stating that they will take half of the payment midway through the process, and the other half before I could physically pick it up. I ordered it at the 3rd to last week in November, and was told that I could pick it up Mid-December. I called Mid-December, and was told that it was back ordered until the end of December. I called again some time later (after finally reaching a customer service representative 40 mins later ""due to high call volume"" - also a recurring theme anytime you call) and was told that that my payment method was no longer valid even though they had charged me for half of the payment already. After confirming my payment method the customer service rep stated that she would call back that day when the payment was finalized and I could set up an appointment to receive to pick up my rug. She never called back and after trying to call 2 more times, in which I couldn't get a customer service rep for over 30 mins each, I decided to hang up and wait to HOPEFULLY hear from this company. I did not hear from them, but did see that payment went through and inversely returned to me. I called to see why my payment had been returned to me and they simply stated that the order had been back ordered until Mid-January, in which I responded to have them return my full payment because I was not dealing with it anymore. Moral of the story: do not buy from this company if you would like a smooth and easy purchase, go to the store and just pick it up, if you want to utilize crate and barrel at all."
2466,3,"Extremely poor service. I sent an e-mail to their customer service email address on 12/07 and as of today, 12/11, have still not heard back, other than an email that said they would get back. Meanwhile, calling the 800 service # is no better. Numerous calls just result in unacceptable hold/wait times. I am currently on hold 23 minutes so far. Sigh!!!!"
2467,1,"To start, it hurt to even tap 1 star here.We ordered the Axis 2 piece sectional in September, were told it would be 7-9 weeks for delivery. 6 weeks in I went to check the status and found out there was now NO expected delivery date- my husband called customer service (after waiting 30 minutes)- passed along to 3 associates- found out the couch was delayed, they could not give us a reason why, but now delivery would be the end of December. As weeks went by I still could not get an accurate status online so we continued to call Crate & Barrel and to say the customer service is horrible is a massive understatement. NO ONE kmows what’s going on. Everyone gave us different info. What he upset us the most is that never once did C&B reach out to us and inform us of delays. We have had to do our own homework and ask a million questions. It turns out that when we ordered, there was a fabric issue ( we assume they didn’t even have it), and they never let us know. The delivery has now been pushed back to FEBRUARY. Again, we were told 7-9 weeks. February will be 18 weeks plus. Absolutely beyond infuriating. And every time we do speakWith customer service they love to throw in that we ordered a “custom sofa”. As in, we ordered a fabric from price group 1. They have made excuses, tried to act as though we didn’t read the fine lines regarding delivery time, etc etc. I cannot believe there are not more complaints. While they make nice furniture, they are an incompetent company that you cannot count on in any capacity. We have been through the ringer. Now the holidays are coming in 2 weeks and our visiting family will have to make do with no couch. We have been “couchless” since September. Don’t trust ordering from them."
2468,2,"I thought this place was top-tier...Ordered two lamps; one came broken. The online returns/exchanges service doesn't seem to have the functionality for an exchange. I was going to do a return and re-order, but they charge for shipping both ways. Called customer service; Kimberly Monroe processed my exchange. A pickup of the broken lamp was scheduled for an 8am-12pm window... a no-show. Call Customer Service and you. are. going. to. wait. Your default automatic response message can't be ""Our call volume right now is higher than usual..."" that just means that 1 hour wait times IS YOUR USUAL. I'll never do Crate & Barrel again. $1000 price tags, dollar store service."
2469,2,"I ordered some furniture almost 3 months ago and still waiting for one piece. Availability date keeps changing and they charged me money but they don't even bother keeping you informed that the delivery date so you have to call them all the time. Finally scheduled the delivery date but with the item not being in the warehouse, who knows what may happen. My advice would be to only buy what they can confirm on the spot because you will be waiting an eternity for it to arrive. sadly this will be the last furniture we buy from Crate and Barrel."
2470,1,"Crate and Barrel has the worst online order and customer service I have ever seen anywhere.I orders two different items and paid for separate wrapping (extra charge for that of course).Items came in in one box wrapped together.So ,I get in touch with their customer service who resent the items,promising to refund me the money I paid for the wrapping and extra box(8 days later,still no sign of the refund) ,and guess what,they came in ,they were AGAIN in one box.Now the second mishap arrived a day before i was to give those presents to two different people which forced me to spend Saturday driving around to find adequate boxes to wrap the presents separately so that I can make my friends happy.. Of course,i contacted C&B again and they offered to send me a 50.00 dollars for the two wrong orders.I turned their offer down because they are the one who twice made the same mistake in the same week.They seem to be very oblivious or I would say,not concerned at all for their mistakes or for wasting my day off to find presentable boxes and wrapping,and they said they will forward my emails to their Home office to find a resolution,adding that I will be contacted within 48 hours. 96 hours later I still haven't heard a word from their home office,so i sent another email and this time ,the next day someone called me,apologized,saying the email was not sent to them until today.So now i am looking at customer service that lied or was lazy,not sure which is worth and still no resolve for two orders that they didn't fix. Home office upped the bribe to 100.00 gift card (that's what they called resolving the waste of my day off and ruining two perfect gifts for my friends.Yes i turned down their offer,but also told them social media will hear about this.It is not a question of revenge at all, a company like C&B proved to be unorganized,liars and seem to not care about their customers and that is what I am showing here."
2471,3,"I ordered approx. $1000. in pillows. I spoke to a supervisor because I wanted to return some and order others. She took my additional order and sent me a FedEx shipping label to return the ones I was not keeping. I requested a refund for the returned items. I shipped the returned items via FedEx on April 8. I never received confirmation of C&B’s receipt or a credit. I called today, May 4, and was told they had received the returned items. They were just sitting on my credit of almost $600.with no explanation. They have said they would issue the credit. TBD. I would hesitate to deal with C&B again."
2472,1,"Alternatives to Crate and Barrel exist: The Restoration company. Crate and Barrel has been sued for stealing ideas - the company is struggling with outdated technology, poor customer care and inability to fulfill promises. As a customer care employee, you are trained to bounce around customers. A customer waits for 30 minutes to reach you, then you send them to another line of 40 minutes. The holiday trick now is to mark everything processing or shipped so that customers cannot cancel within an hour. That includes the weekend. Meanwhile, there is no one processing any of that stuff. The timelines you see on the website are all lies. The plan is to have you the customer pay the money, while customer care have a different true timeline. Online you will see availability of Mid January, the true availability is March then the deceit begins. The whole point is to make it hard enough that you wait for that March or whatever date they have. Also, the chemicals used in production of their items are not regulated - from overseas. Be careful not to poison your children. Nightmare buying from them."
2473,1,"Purchased the cameo white bookcase April 2018. It was delivered June 2018, however it was missing the entire crown molding at the top, base molding and a finishing piece on the inside. This was noted at delivery. After more than 40 phone calls, 8 employees, 4 deliveries (plus 1 booking when the delivery team didn’t show up) and another 7 months...I finally had the bookcase that I paid for. The bookcase plus delivery was just short of 2500.00 Canadian dollars. I was promised compensation for my troubles but the customer service manager at Yorkdale, named Janis, will not return my calls. I have left 4 messages now. I would discourage any furniture purchases. This company has the absolute worst customer service I have ever encountered. This is the first time I have ever written a review."
2474,3,Believe me when I say... I frickin LOVE Billie eilish. I play her non stop during the day for weeks at a time since I found out about her. I actually wanted to buy physical format music again ok. I haven’t done such a thing since Napster/limewire came out. So imagine my damn disappointment when all 3 (returned and replacement) came defective. First one came cracked. Second one had dots over it. Third one skipped my all time fav track “you should see me in a crown”. I cleaned all three vinyls before attempting to play it. These vinyls have a bad pressing. Please make sure you play through the entire album before leaving a 5 star review. I’m pissed. I won’t be owning this until they release a new one.
2475,3,"Love Billie Eilish but her songs just don’t work well on vinyl - the bass is too low (ex. the low beats in Xanny just make the record skip through the song) and either it wasn’t formatted well into the record or it’s just too much bass for vinyl. I’d only recommend buying this album if you have a very very good quality record player, because mine just skipped through most of the album and I had to return the record."
2476,3,"Replacement item arrived today and playback is just as bad as the first one. We really gave this the benefit of the doubt but were definitely disappointed again. Returning this for a refund. You can see artifacts in almost the same exact location as the previous record. The replacement was plagued with random skipping and distorted audio. Can't stress enough, this record player has absolutely no issues playing the other two sony manufactured records we've purchased. Playback is smooth and effortless with those, while this one you can't even enjoyably listen to. It's unfortunate, but I do not recommend purchasing this particular item. You might have better luck with another batch/ collector's version but two bad ones in a row is not a good sign. You're better off sticking to digital on this one, unless you want it for display only.
-----
My younger sister recently got a record player for her birthday and we're slowly building her collection. She has two other records that are fantastic. Smooth playback, no skipping.
As for this one - terrible skipping, unusable playback. It has minimal to no warping and yet it plays like the most warped piece of vinyl ever. Very disappointed that so many customers on here were right, and the amount of defective products being sent out is honestly inexcusable. I noticed one review mention that even their replacement was defective. I echo that person's statement, and if the replacement I receive is also defective I'll just return this.
We listen to this album on that one music app that starts with an 'S', and it's a great album the whole family enjoys. So it's a real shame if they do not resolve this."
2477,3,"My sister bought this, so I thought I should give it a listen. Is this really the future of pop music? The vocals are whiney/wispy and fed with a downmix of toilet paper roll tube effect. I saw a couple music videos, and she clearly knocks off Tool in terms of wanting to be creepy and artistic. I really hope this girls music evolves or becomes experimental. Clearly this cannot be the direction for female pop artists. I thought we were all over emo?"
2478,3,I have requested a replacement so here's hoping the one they send me isn't defective. I took this out of the box (which was undamaged) and immediately put it on my turntable. The record was so bent that the needle skipped ahead during every song and I couldn't listen to it. hoping the replacement isn't the same.UPDATE: received a new one and have the same issues.
2479,3,"Country of manufacturing not stated. Original order had one of the posters ripped and a printing defect on the sleeve inside. LP had too much surface noise and was scratched; stickers missing. Replacement had outer sleeve and inner sleeve all ripped; LP was warped causing bad sound distortion. Returned both items, not worth keeping."
2480,3,I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE !!! THERE IS NOT A SONG ON THE DVD OR BLU-RAY THAT IS COMPLETE ONLY PARTS OF SONGS AND TALKING OF THE SONGS. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET A COMPLETE CONCERT AND INSTEAD ITS ALL PARTS OF SONGS AND A CONCERT !!! I SENT IT BACK !!!
2481,1,"I was sure looking forward to this release. The first copy I received was quite warped and made a noisy whoosh at every revolution. The second copy was better but still warped. There was quite a bit of surface noise, too, and the sound struck me as harsh and thin. Well-pressed vinyl always sounds warm and deep to me. What a shame that Harvest and EMI didn't exercise more quality control on such a special release. I would avoid this version if I were you. The SACD version from a few years back is infinitely superior despite this latest remastering."
2482,2,"Where is the list of songs... Oh found it. On another site. Sigh... I will not purchase (saddly enough), so little content. I am very disapointed in what is available. The Doors have so many good songs... where are they? Volume 2? I will not be ""riding this storm""..."
2483,3,"This boxed set was a deep disappointment and I was embarrassed to have bought it. The new material is patchy and badly recorded. The great classic hits are there, but in really poor versions. You really should save your money and use it to buy the individual albums."
2484,3,Bad quality. To be honest I don’t know if my record player brand BYONE is too bad or the quality of this Vinyl is awful. Both I bought on amazon. If I knew that it was not going to be possible to listen pretty well I should had save more money to buy a better record player. Some vinyls I can listen something but this Bob Marley legend it’s impossible to hear any song with quality in my record speakers.The vendor Byone actually offered me 50% refund of my record player but even though it doesn’t help because I can not enjoy the vinyls anyways. Thanks for the attention but unfortunately it didn’t solve my problem :( .
2485,1,"Hahahahaha! Ok,ok, joke's over. You guys had me going there for a while! Everyone that gave this five stars can come out of their hiding spots and review this album for REAL now. Shame on you people! Pulling a trick like that on me. For a minute, I actually thought there WERE people out there who'd give this album rave reviews. You guys are SO sneaky!"
2486,3,"Playable, but not very good quality. Both discs appeared to be undamaged, but during playback there was a consistent hissing/static that I haven't experienced with any of my other vinyl. Returned for full refund."
2487,3,"The cds were good but the case was scratched all over and broken on one of the joint corners. The case is unusable. But I got the cd I wanted so, oh well. These things happen sometimes."
2488,3,"Record arrived with damaged corners inside of an undamaged shipping box, the soundtrack record is very warped but plays through on both sides, and the jacket immediately puffed up and swelled open as soon as it left the shrink wrap; to the point that on the shelf pressed between other records it's pushing them away on both sides to open itself up. :/ ."
2489,2,"Ordered this online so I could download it to my computer. Even downloaded the retarded music player amazon uses even though I already have one and wound up with popups on my computer now that bypass my firewall. On top of that it won't even download to my computer. It won't even sync up with the craplousy music player I downloaded, and since its an electronic download and not a product I can't return it. Amazon music is a waste of time. I'm going back to Microsoft. What a waste of time and money."
2490,3,"Cheaply made, recorded on low quality tape with no noise reduction of any sort, generally terrible from a practical perspective. If you want to listen to this soundtrack on cassette, I recommend you record it yourself from a digital download.
However, this still looks really cool. If you want to cosplay, the lower tier Walkmans are dirt cheap, as are headphones similar to the ones from the movie. This can still be used to play music for novelty, if you avoid fast forwarding and rewinding, and don't put it in any deck you are not ok with filling with tape dust."
2491,3,Arrived in perfect physical condition but the recording is terrible. A lot of static. I gave it as a gift. Needless to say they gave it back to me.
2492,3,Some of the copies of this classic are in fact bootleg European product. These companies take advantage of lax copyright laws and reissue old recording. My suspicion is that they simple take a cd and press a master vinyl disk from this. My copy was not only bootlegged it was defective. Side one had an audible tick over 90% of the side. There was no visible scratch. Poor mastering?
2493,1,"The wall is a 2cd set, I received only one. The jewel case broke apart opening it. I got half the order for the full price. Out of dozens of CDs I've ordered this is the first that was terrible. I recommend using other distributers that are reliable, this one is terrible."
2494,3,"I returned the first two I received as 3/4 sides skipped. This third one does as well on side B and C, but not nearly as many songs. Very disappointed. Customer service with Amazon was fantastic. No problems sending them back, upgraded shipping for the third album and the agent I spoke with on the phone was fantastic!! Still debating sending this third album back, the music when it works is just so good, just not sure there is a copy that actually works. The contents are pretty fun, comes with prints from the movie and the record sleeves are nice with pictures on them."
2495,3,this is the second time having to replace the vinyl due to manufacturing. First time the vinyl didn't fit on the record player as expected due to the label sticker. The second time the album arrived with white streaks causing the vinyl to skip/scratch when playing. was unable to remove the white streaks. Hopefully third time is the charm.
2496,3,"Both these double album records were Christmas gifts... in last week, heard from both recipients that1- one record did not even fit proper on turntable! (hole not big enough) they pushed hard... ended up making their whole system screech when tried to play! so immediately stopped but nearly broke the peg trying to pull it off player! second record skipped on many songs!!2-next recipient had one record split/ cracked totally thru vinyl when opened! definite fault in record as you can tell by location of the break! plus 2nd record skips as well!i am so disappointed & embarrassed! where did these albums come from that both are so damaged? definitely extremely poor quality when BOTH are so faulty! HELP !!! anybody else ever experience this before? i never have ...what the heck?!!! i want my money back! Absolutely ridiculous!"
2497,1,"relative garbage from a band that copped a number of it's ""genuine"" sounds from the greats (pixies,very early replacements,etc.)and so forth made billions. The reason why this stuff sounded so fresh to everyone at the time was because the air waves were spewing out Axle Rose and slaughter, but to the initiated everyone knows that you gotta stay away from the airwaves in the first place. Im not saying that cobain didn't have great taste in music, because he did, im just saying check out the originals. Do yourself a favor and put down the rolling stone magazine, and look into something genuine. I recommend Surfer Rosa by the pixies or Tim by the replacements."
2498,3,"Like others, I encountered the same problem with the new Sgt Pepper, 180 gram LP edition - an absolutely atrocious pressing on BOTH sides, filled with fade-outs and distortion that bleeds from one speaker to the other. Amazon is sending a replacement copy; mine was purchased back in November at the time of initial release (but not opened until Xmas), so hopefully the replacement copy comes from a subsequent pressing that remedied the problem.Otherwise, Let it Be sounds just fine !!"
2499,3,This my third and final copy of Sgt. Pepper. I urge everyone to put it on and listen to LCD. This is the most obvious problem. The hi end is scratchy finger nail chalkboard awful... I hoped 180 g would be an improvement. I returned the first two copies to a local record store. I thought I would try Amazon hoping that somewhere else in the run a good copy may exist. I played this copy on three different systems for the same result.Side 2 was not so bad. But Side one is ruined.Keep your old copy and the 20 dollars. This one is going back to amazon for the refund.
2500,1,"Hello, I returned my Sgt. Pepper Vinyl as the album was unplayable. Clearly there are some LP's with defective pressing. I gave up when I got to Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds as the sound was horrible with one side having distortion and the sound coming in loudly and softly. This doesn't hold a candle to my old 60's Pepper pressing. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR IF YOU WANT THIS ALBUM, GO TO YOUR LOCAL VINTAGE RECORD SHOP AND PICK IT UP. Original analogue sound with no pressing issues, maybe a few warm cracks and snaps. If you choose to buy, buyer beware.Since I wrote the review of the Stereo vinyl they have re-released the MONO version. The MONO version is a five star rating. None of the pressing issues outlined above and superior sound."
2501,3,This is the censored version. Very important detail left out in the description. Not once was it written in the description. And the photo has the explicit lyrics on the cover. Completely ruined the experience.
2502,3,"""SACD"" stands for ""super audio CD"" and means that it likely will NOT play on your CD player UNLESS you've spent extra money for a special system. Amazon.com does not say anywhere what ""SACD"" stands for or what having an SACD actually means to you, the end-of-the-line user. If, on the other hand, amazon.com DOES inform you, the information is buried so obscurely in the website you'll likely NOT figure it out until after you have the product in your hands and it's too late to do anything about it."
2503,3,"It actually comes in a clear plastic sleeve with a cardboard insert displaying track information ONLY!!! No jewelcase, no ""gold record award""-like display.As Michael would have said, ""you know they're bad!""."
2504,3,I received Thriller on vinyl along with a Dire Straits album. Thriller has a visible stain on side A and has audible distortion. I would return the product but then I would be forced to pay for the expensive shipping costs of a record.
2505,3,"I purchased this app several weeks ago for my son to play on my samsung galaxy phone. The download went through and I was charged for it but the app has never worked. It doesn't even open on my phone. I spoke to several customer service reps about the problem through email and over the phone but no one was able to correct the issue. The last person to look into it said that there were some reports about issues with some downloads and they were ""working on trying to find a solution"". Also said they had no idea how long that could take. Since there is a no refund policy I completely wasted my $7."
2506,2,"I love Minecraft on PS3, specifically survival mode. My issues with survival mode here is that there's no farming aspect, there's only two difficulty choices (no hostile mobs or hoards of hostile mobs that appear even in well lit areas), and in my world I could not find any caves! And I dug from one end to the other and down to bedrock. I don't mind the world's being smaller, but give me something to explore. Add in the lack of many items to build, and that I'm not one for creative mode, and I'm left with a product I would not have bought if I knew this ahead of time."
2507,3,"Hello,Mine craft is getting vary frustrating I created a creative and it just deleted it my friend and I can't play on the same game cause it will just freeze, glitch or disconnect both of us. But when I'm playing it alone or in the car it won't do any of that stuff .other than that PROBLEM you should keep updating it to the full Pc version.Thank you for your time by by."
2508,3,"I had played a lot of Minecraft at one time, on a laptop. I thought that a tablet version might get my young son interested. However, I find it difficult to control which way Steve is pointing, and where he's going, and what he's hitting. It's like the field of view is too small; I can't see enough of my surroundings, and I find it frustrating. I probably shouldn't have bought it; keep it to a computer."
2509,3,"I have been playing pe for 5 years, and now... YOU CAN'T PLAY IT! WE ARE NOT PLAYING ON A PC! WE HAVE ONE BUTTON! FOX IT MOJANG! I WANT MY MONEY BACK! I am not 10. Just having a bad day..."
2510,3,It's currently pretty useless because of the limited functionality with lots of bugs too such as pop-ups that lock you out and force you to restart. I love Firefox so I'm hoping Mozilla rolls out updates asap and this gets developed into a full browser.
2511,3,"I'm very disappointed. 99% of the apps are in English. Almost all of them are with money. You download the app free and after when you want to see the shows you pay. You can see old movies for free. I'm dissatisfied of my purchase. Even when I look the quality of image is poor. It is a very weak product if we compare with Google Chromecast. Probable it works great if you buy the Prime package and you see their shows and movies. I'm not interested in this, so I looked up for another purpose and I failed."
2512,3,"Wife told me to take it out. Her Brother was here and wanted to watch You Tube, and so installed FireFox to use it. Problem with the Fire Stick, no current stream web browsers available such as Internet Explorer nor Google."
2513,3,"I gave up and sent it back. It's probably just me, not tech savie enough. I couldn't find a full manual anywhere. It doesn't come with anything more than the set up. I couldn't find one on line either. I managed to set up OK. Fluked into finding the right HMDI but trying to shows I wanted to watch was a stumper to me. In the end, I disconnected it all, repacked it and returned it. Then I had to struggle with getting the HDMI back to where it needed to be for the TV to work. I'm sure it would be great for someone who understands how these things work. I expected it to allow me to send something I was watching online to the TV's larger screen. I guess I was wrong."
2514,3,"This app appeared when I logged into Britbox for the first time. I thought I was supposed to download it to stream shows from Britbox. When I started watching my first show, there were breaks for commercials. I called Britbox and found out I didn't need Tubi to watch their shows. I uninstalled Tubi and proceeded to watch my shows commercial-free. I would never have downloaded this app if it hadn't been placed in such a way that it seemed to be necessary to watch programs on Britbox. This was sneaky and misleading. The app costs nothing, and that's what I think it's worth."
2515,3,"Nice Hardware and software both on Android & the remote w good image&audio.No Voice remote.& Apps?¿.I just set up this Amazon Fire stick TV thing without voice apparently The Voice version is not available in Canada :-( first thing I took a shot at was trying that TUBI App. It kind of looks like Netflix which I once had a couple years ago on trial and sort of like Crackle TV that they stopped using or adding two and then cancelled on the Samsung smart TVs. I picked it because it was there and it says it's free. Then I get an automatic email from Amazon saying we're billing you for this and then the building says free so it's kind of Freaky Like Big Brother is watching and Amazon connected right to my wallet and if I make one wrong move I'll be charged for anything that's a wrong move. I noticed the settings automatically on the Fire TV are automatically start audio and automatically start video. That means if I accidentally pressed something that cost money that I spend on so it kind of feels like I really better watch my step here. Period. Or I could lose some money very quickly doing the wrong thingThat being said, I know when one criticizes one should start with the Positive stuff first so here it is now. The packaging was really slick and compressed Compact and easy and perfectly done and the equipment is exceptionally simple to attach as long as you have an HDMI slot. I had to struggle and make one because I had other junk hanging in my slots that I wasn't making use of. The remote is highly responsive and the sound and image on my older Samsung Smart TV most sound and look great. I'd random I picked a Korean spy Adventure movie I think it is LOL almost randomly and when I did some more settings and explore settings more and came back I couldn't come back because there was no place that I could find where things I started watching where held in a special place to continue watching them. Maybe it exists maybe it doesn't because I don't know. The intro mention that there was an Android app for a smartphone app to handle the remote control stuff and I got very excited about that I downloaded it right away and it works in the slightly unusual and you. Since this remote control in Canada is called the basic version basic all over the place I guess meeting there ain't no microphone in Canada to control Android TV and Android Echo and Echo. I also have the Google stuff as well. I figured with verbal commands on the echo products from Amazon and since they do have the speak into and command remote controls for the fire stick in the state's why not in Canada and here it was with a microphone on the software version and I pulled out on the microphone and you hold it and you see an audio waveform horizontally across the top of the screen as you talk so I figured maybe I just have to have the right commands does nothing happened. Now I'm thinking because it's only available as a Hardware in the states and because I set my location to Canada for haps I could talk into the damn thing all I want and nothing's going to happen because they shut us out for the audio commands. Here in Canada both the speaking remote control and now it looks like the software on the Android for this fire stick... that's shut out here too. I hate feeling like a second-class citizen brought to me by Amazon, just because I'm in Canada! :-(.Nice Hardware and software both on Android & the remote w good image&audio.No Voice remote.& Apps?¿."
2516,3,"I love all the free tv apps out there, so... I tried out Tubi TV. So..I downloaded it on my Fire TV. My sister downloaded the app as well to hers. Initially I was pleasantly surprised. I watched Europa Report, and a few other movies. It wasn’t bad, better than local tv, very few commercials, much like Hulu. Then..I went to check out the documentaries, since I am a big fan of those. I was surprised to see almost every documentary was about porn stars, or the porn business. No documentaries about history, WWII, science like YouTube or Amazon. I watched a few minutes of a documentary about porn stars who left the business to get a regular job, and live a normal life. There was very graphic material in the documentary. The documentary had a MA rating. The odd thing is I did not sign up for Tubi, or create a login. I just downloaded the app from Amazon, and started playing movies. Not a good thing for a child, or a young teen in the house, which is the case for my sister. I did search a Google, and Tubi does have parental controls. But..it’s kinda backwards, you have to create an account to block mature subject material. I have clicked on videos on YouTube, and got a warning before the video loads. YouTube will warn you, mature subject material, and that you need to login or create an account to view the video."
2517,3,The app it’s self is easy to use but the Canadian content is lacking. Mostly B movies almost all of which we have never heard of and we are mivie watchers. Update us to the US standard and it would be a 5.
2518,3,I was enjoying this app on the BlackBerry Passport up until recently. I cannot re-download it on my device. It's not searchable and does not come up in my Cloud within the Amazon App Store. Re-enable this for the Passport as there were no issues.
2519,1,"won't let you install on most android's now, soooo stupid. plus netflix get you shyt together and do 4k accross all android boxes, right after you support all boxes again.just go download the apk your self . don't bother with the amazon store for this one."
2520,3,"When I first signed up for Netflix they were great. The shipping was lightning fast whether I was signed up for 1 disc or 3 disc delivery. If I had a problem streaming, I got some sort of a refund (prorating). If I received a damaged disc, the replacement was in my hand the next day. If I switched plans from a more expensive one to a cheaper one, they would prorate for that's month service. Then Netflix got angry at its customers or got greedy or something. No more fast delivery, no more prorating, price increases, etc. They are not the company they once were, and if Blockbuster can ever match their shipping speeds or if Amazon ever gets as wide a movie selection, goodbye to Netflix. Netflix got rid of party watch, which was a service I enjoyed because my brother lives on the other side of the U.S. And they got rid of their Netflix social thing which I very much enjoyed. They truly are only worried about profits. They now rank up their with Wal-Mart in terms of ""services"" I hate to give my money to."
2521,3,"Not working on Fire 8 tablet.. I logged in, logged off, restarted the tabled, updated the software, deinstalled the app and installed it back again and none of this work. So sad that Netflix doesn't work on my Fire 8."
2522,3,"I can't give this app a good rating until they work out the bugs. I can't watch anything with the netflix app on my kindle fire. It constantly freezes the frame then quickly speeds back up to where the show is supposed to be. And when I say constantly, I mean it in the literal sense of the word. If it only did it a few times - ok, I can deal with that. I can't deal with it every 3-5 seconds because it makes watching and enjoying a show impossible. Also the video quality is very grainy on my fire.
Please fix this Netflix! I know I'm not the only one experiencing these problems. Guess I will have to stick to my Wii for netflix enjoyment for now."
2523,3,"This game is good but it needs some changes. First of all sometimes when I open the app sometimes the screen turns pink and just stays there and then the game starts but I cant see anything and I die! Second off all the game HORRIBLY lags sometimes. Third of all sometimes when the game starts I tap
once and then my character just stops and I can't move and the hawk gets me! Also when I am moving my character stops in the middle of the street and I get duck run over! Fourth of all this all causes viruses on my kindle fire I download the app to get rid of the virus and it does but then the virus comes back cause of this game! And last but not least, when it said there was a update I clicked download and when the update was at like 99 percent it said install failled! I try to download it again but I get the same result. Please fix these bugs, otherwise this game is great!"
2524,3,"I've updated this game more times then I've played it... each time 40 mb's to download and I've only played it 4 times as it crashes after a few rounds. Which is a good thing because I could play it all day, when not updating. Once you get used to the controls it's entertaining and creative."
2525,3,I bought this app a few months ago and the kids and I love it. Works good on iPhone and Kindle Fires but too slow on Fire Stick and get run over constantly. For the last several days it won't open on Amazon devices. It crashes after pressing the screen to open the app. The app went through an automatic update just before it crashed. I don't t want to lose the in app purchases I bought! HELP!!!! Giving it two stars because it's been DAYS and app is not fixed and it happens to be the kids school vacation when they have time to play.
2526,3,"I see people love this game, but it's basically frogged with chickens. Why the heck is the chicken crossing the road? I have no idea. It's a slow chicken. It might even have a broken leg, because the response time between pressing go and when the chicken goes is confusing. I've lost a lot of chickens in the forty five minutes I tried to mess with this game. They lost their lives in vain, and while this should be a lovely mine craft styled game of daring, it just wasn't for me.
The colors and graphics are nice though."
2527,3,Garbage. Would not run properly on my blackberry - serious graphical issues on blackberry. If you're a blackberry user don't waste your time. This game works perfectly on my other devices.
2528,1,"I don't know why you would want to download a program like this, it is only to waste your time, and it is spyware. God knows why it wants everybodys name and phone number on your phone. Run, Hide, don't download. or put it in a device that is only on wifi that you can turn off the internet."
2529,2,"I stay off Facebook, except for a quick posts from something I have read. I do not like the pettiness, the hatred, the criticism . . . Even some videos of animal abuse. It is too much . . ."
2530,3,i WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT FACE BOOK WOULD BE THE SAME AS i GET ON MY PHONE OR COMPUTER ...BUT INSTEAD ALL I GET IS VIDEOS AND i CANNOT GET MY PERSONAL NEWS FEED WITH POST FROM MY FRIENDS OR GROUPS...WHAT'S UP WITH THAT ?
2531,3,"Facebook worked great on my Kindle Fire HD for the longest time. There must have been an &#34;upgrade?&#34; when I wasn't looking. Now, none of the links work and there's no way to change any settings. Unable to read stories longer than what's on the main page. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling. It works like normal for about 2 minutes or until I leave the app, then it goes right back. Not happy."
2532,3,Loved this app so much I made the in-app purchase for unlimited access for $15. It worked great until I upgraded my kindle. What a waste of money that ended up being. Customer service tells me in-app purchases cannot transfer to other devices. Save your money and stay with the free version. Amazon..I loved dealing with you but this policy makes me question future purchases.
2533,1,"It gets old fast, even for my almost 2 year old. DO NOT purchase the ""LIFETIME ACCESS"" if you have a kindle free play account. There is no way to add the ""digital subscription"" to the device. You will have to use a different account / device, which defeats the purpose of them moving away being able to lock them into a screen. Took me an hour of searching to figure out this wasn't supported and finally cancelled and asked for a return through calling customer service....what a mess and a headache. We all have so much free time as parents, pun intended."
2534,3,"Does not work in kid's profile.This is a pretty nice app, but I don't like it as much as Endless Wordplay. This app just like the ""Endless"" apps has a very limited number of words available in the free version and Freetime does not support ""in app purchases"" therefor you are not able to purchase the full version of this for your child to use. I wish Amazon would either address this really serious problem with FreeTime or the developers who's apps are being used by Amazon would offer a full paid version without the use of ""in app purchases"" so that people can purchase the full version for use by their children in their own profile. Without the ability to do that, these apps are really just very minimal sample versions with no ability to purchase to full version for use in your child's profile."
2535,3,"App is great, but purchased subscription is not available from kid's profile, making it useless waste of money. I researched so!utions, emailed support many times and got no reply. Daughter is heartbroken daily as I try to explain why I can't remove locks."
2536,1,"Unfortunately I have to give this app 1 stars. I never buy anything in the apps until I know how my son likes them. I have never had problems with apps working in the kindle freetime. As soon as I paid for the unlimited word version ($14.99 + tax), I have had nothing but problems. When the kindle was turned off for the night this app lost everything. It will not allow me to restore the previous purchase. It needs to be made right. I will not recommend this app to anyone."
2537,3,"I have a subscription through my internet and TV provider so I can log in and watch crave on my computer but when I log in through the Amazon app I can see my lists and my account but can't play anything. Every time I select something to play, I keep getting the message that I need to have a subscription. I've tried logging in and out and it still won't work."
2538,2,"DOWNLOADED CRAVE BUT DID NOT INSTALL IT - DUE TO SUSPECTED DEMAND FOR CREDIT CARD INFO.WHY IS CREDIT CARD REQUIRED FOR ""FREE"" CRAVE SUBSCRIPTION.I SUSPECT THE ""FREE"" WILL END AND YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE FOR IT - FORCING ME THRU A LONG PROCESS TO CANCEL AND RECOVER CHARGES. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN - OR WILL CANCEL BELL ALT FIBE ASAP."
2539,3,"Product states that it offers a streaming service but when used, a security pin number is required to access programing. This security number is not provided and when I called for assistance (22 minutes on phone) no solution was provided. I used an Amazon fire stick to access the Crave app. A total example of false advertising to get customers to subscribe; do not get sucked in by this so called service."
2540,2,"I would give it less than one star if I could. At least my Netflix account doesn’t kick me out, make me go online to enter Crave’s 5 digit code, then say the code is wrong. Did that about a dozen times! I’m still not signed back in! Not worth the 9.99/month! Definitely will not be paying for the upgrade if I can’t even sign-in on the fire stick."
2541,2,"Crave TV itself is pretty good, not as much content as NF but it’s getting there. Although, the app for Firestick is complete garbage. It lacks all the basic features you can think of. You can’t restart a movie/tv show once it’s started, you have to rewind it like a VCR. You can't select individual episodes once you started watching it, you have to search for the tv show and then select it from there. Even worse it doesn’t remember where you were last time you watched and the my crave list doesn’t sync with the web app. Overall, extremely badly designed. It’s the only reason I will not renew with Crave until they get a UX designer that knows how a basic tv app should work and redesign the whole thing."
2542,3,Years ago board games were created so people could have fun. This game was created so the designer could have fun and make a lot of money. To move to higher levels you have to spend a lot of money. That is addiction - not fun.
2543,2,Like tbis game but also play GardenScapes. You need to add some of the features that GardenScapes has. Add some extra bonuses etc. I am not one to real.$$$ to play games but if game goes no where because of no way to move forward .... I will delete game. Getting there with Homescapss.
2544,3,"The game itself in good, however I find that having to purchase boosts not very appealing to me at all. Why can you not put a bonus wheel in this game just as Gardenscapes has, or any other game for that matter. Not cool!"
2545,3,"Very beautiful, and quite fun, until you get to the higher levels... Then you cannot win without spending a LOT of money. I would rather pay a one-time fee for this game to be less frustrating. :( ."
2546,3,This game obviously alters gameplay so that you are forced into buying coins/boosters/etc. The makers of this game are very dishonest and respond to complaints with canned comments that do not help at all. When a game is programmed to cause failure this is the worst kind of dishonesty and it is very disappointing since his game can be so good.
2547,1,"You claim I am a cheat and won't let me claim coins from watching a video. Technically you are cheats too. You have cheated me out of the coins for several months. So as they say, it takes one to know one. You advertise how to get free coins all the time. That's nothing but a huge scam to suck a person into more games.
I am not a hacker. If I was I'd certainly be at a higher level.
Waiting 18 hrs to open more jewelry boxes is a little absurd also.
So sit in your office and continue to judge people. When my coins are gone, I am uninstalling the game."
2548,3,"I kept getting messages from others, that I usually access on my laptop, but while my wife was in the hospital and I only had my tablet, I thought I'd give it a try. I quickly found out I didn't like the way it ran on the tablet so tried to uninstall it, only to find out it can't be done! Now I have something I will almost never use clogging up memory from my OS."
2549,3,"I got this for my Kindle and it does not work. Wasted my time. Very frustrated. If you fix it, and if it works with my Kindle, I will use it. But for now... a pain in the neck!"
2550,3,"On my KFHD (1st Gen) there is no sound on video chat, but the text part works. On my KF 5th gen 7"", the text part works until it updates, then won't open at all. I delete it, disable automatic updates, and reinstall. It works for a bit, then updates itself anyway, and then won't open.Update: Something updated and now it's just a white screen even when I re-install. :("
2551,2,"I did not want it, I did not need it, I had no choice in the matter and given a choice would NOT have used it. Once an alternative comes along to give what I currently get from Facebook, which isn't much, I will leave facebook in a heartbeat."
2552,3,My 6 yr old downloaded this without my knowledge and has been playing it for awhile. I finally got a chance to take a look at it and it is gruesome. You see people slowly die and blood and guts. NOT A FAN.
2553,3,"The game starts off fun, but quickly becomes a pay to win timeShare. From begging u to spend real money <U+0001F4B0>right after the first match because you have to wait 2days or pay to continue. To bad I was starting to like it, but have better things to do than play a waiting game. A game with ""player choice"" to pay so u don't have to play."
2554,3,Play for 15 secinds watch 20-30 second ad after victory. Then another 20-30 second ad to unlock reward. Then another ad to double it. Never had enough time to figure out if game was enjoyable long term. Tried a few more matches and the add ratio got worse. Literally anytime you touch the screen an add Is shown. At least give some time to figure out if the game is any good before asking for 5 bucks to remove the ads.
2555,3,"My 7 year old grandson downloaded this game during my last visit. Soon after, he asked me to remove the game from my tablet. I asked him why? He said ""it was inappropriate for children."" So I asked ""Why?"" again. He said ""it showed blood"". I, myself did not play the game, so I cannot say how offensive the graphics were."
2556,3,"We allow our grandchildren to download games on our Kindle Fire tablets when they stay with us, which is frequently. They know they are allowed only one hour on the tablets, then we do other activities together. They also know that all games downloaded must reflect FREE and they follow this rule. When something is questionable, they ask us. This game reflected FREE when downloaded, but when the home screen is opened the quite large ""START"" button displayed is not for playing the game, it is for signing up for a ""subscription"" at a cost of $7.99 PER WEEK. There is small print with the button identifying this, but it can be easily overlooked. The 'START"" is large font and the other print is very small font. When my grandson downloaded the game, I received an email alert from Amazon of the charge. When I researched the app/game I realized what occurred. Fortunately, there was also a notice of a 3-day free trial period in the small print. I immediately deleted the game the same day it was downloaded and contacted Amazon explaining what occurred, the 3-day Free Trial, and requested they remove the $7.99 charge, which they did. Users beware of small print and read it. One last comment, the quality of the graphics looks simplistic, that is, not even close to the graphics in Angry Birds. $7.99 a week, REALLY!!!"
2557,3,"Purchased a new Android Tablet to replace another that is no longer working. Wanted to download my apps previously purchased from the AppStore. Needed to download and install the Amazon appstore app (APK) on tablet to accomplish this. This is something I have done several times in the past. However, now, there is no way possible to do this from the Amazon website. It just tells me I already own it with no options to download or purchase it again. Only option is to use a 3rd party download which I would not trust. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. I guess I'll have to now solely use the Google Playstore for my app requirements. Very disappointed in Amazon especially after so many years of using them for my purchasing requirements."
2558,2,"Very annoyed with this app on my Gal 6...it keeps trying to force me to change my global settings to allow any random 3rd party apps/software to be downloaded to my phone, and is CONSTANTLY putting reminder messages on my phone, even after I allegedly disabled them. If Amazon can't spend a few scheckels to make sure I'm not going to be hit with every random piece of junk code that sneaks into the Goog Play store, then I can't be bothered to update this app, ever, and I'm going to spend some time trying to figure out how to get it off my phone."
2559,3,"Using Amazon coins to make in - app purchases seems like a great idea, and it is. When the transaction goes through.When you don't receive your items in-app, you have to contact Amazon customer service, who may or may not help you by refundng your coins so that you can attempt the transaction again.I used to spend $400 a month on Amazon coins. Now I'm told I can't receive refunds because I've asked for too many. And yet, it's not me that wrote the code that's supposed to communicate between the app and Amazon. How come that guy still has a job?I guess Jeff Bezos already has enough money."
2560,1,5s yourselves! Simplify damnit.You infect MY phone that i PAY FOR and I OWN!!!!!! WITH YOUR FECES. Then you abandon that make a new one and have all this other shit you offer. Both music and the prime videos.Why isnt there one central Amazon app. If you turn into alphabet #2 im done. Im about ready to abandon android. Garbage now a days. Been down hill since google bought it from android consortium.I think Apple won years ago.. Better platform. No question.
2561,1,"Need to bring back the appstore that lets me shop for products AND app store (underground appstore just maybe?) instead of having 2 seperate ridiculous apps running in the background hoping to garner some business. And in reality because of the app changes, my Amazon shopping has dropped by at least 60% and moved on to wallyworld. Yes, I would rather use helmart than the new crap amazon apps. Oh and fire your idiot developers..."
2562,1,"Once again, someone tries to take the classic match-3 genre and invent new game play mechanics to make it seem new and clever, but all it does is highlight the fact that you should buy boosters if you want to succeed because those new mechanics just make the game frustrating instead of fun. This game is garbage. Avoid."
2563,1,"Well I tried it, and it's a no. It's really boring, but people who like matching games like this, might like it. So don't waste your storage and time to get this app unless you like matching games.Thanks!"
2564,1,"I enjoyed playing Fishdom until I purchased the Bank. I had it for all of two hours when I paused playing for a bit and came back, it had disappeared. Contacted their Customer Service and was told the game is graphic intensive and my Kindle Fire HD10 was just shy of the memory needed to load all the items. Very unhappy. They said I should contact Amazon's CS for a refund. Be careful that you can keep what you pay for in Fishdom."
2565,1,"This is exactly like Candy Crush and a bunch of similar games. I had hoped for something different and more challenging. I deleted it from my device as soon as I realized what a knock-off it was. It was free, so no loss of money, but not worth my time or taking up valuable space on my device. Don't waste you time with this game if you have a multitude of others -- it's not a bit better!"
2566,1,Beware!!! I was lured in to buy diamonds but they disappear and I had not used them all- I like the game but it is costing to much money because of disappearing diamonds. I am deleting it -it is costing me too much money!! Gambling!!!
2567,3,"I downloaded the app for Amazon Fire TV. I couldn’t see what any of the content was without creating a free account, only to realize there was not one thing I was interested to watch. And getting support to delete that account was a major headache! You can see the content without an account on their website. I would suggest looking at that first before adding to Fire TV stick - otherwise it’s not worth your time."
2568,3,"The description inviting you to download the app says it has ""hit movies and tv shows"" in their available selection. Not only did my husband and I NOT find any hits in what is available, we had never heard of most of the movies and shows listed. The titles of many of them sounded like they would be rated as b movies, barely fit for even that rating. We found nothing available that we would want to actually see. If I could reduce the rating to 1/2 or 1/4 of a star, I would!"
2569,2,"I downloaded this app and went to watch my first movie. Before the movie loaded, I was presented with 5, 90 second ads. Understanding this was a free app, it was expected and I wasn't surprised so I sat through them. After the 4th time of watching the same 90 second prescription drug advertisement, I couldn't believe it came on again for the fifth time. I got through the painful 7 and a half mins, watched maybe 10 mins of the movie, and the same commercial again started. I watched it until it started for the 2nd time then closed and deleted the app. I fully expect free services to have ads, but the same one over and over and over and over and over and over again is ridiculous. And over, sorry, I missed one. Farewell Bigstar and Bigger Pharma!!"
2570,3,"I loaded this not knowing anything about it. I spent a few minutes looking for familiar movies. After looking a short time, I concluded that I wasn't familiar with a single one. Granted, I didn't conduct an extensive search, nevertheless, I was disappointed that there wasn't a single movie I had the least interest in. From what I saw, I would be willing to bet these flicks were ones that bombed at the box office or were in very limited release. When I have more time, I will look again, but am not very optimistic that further searching will reap much reward."
2571,1,"Don't waste your time with this app. In my teens and 20's I worked in a video store and since then I have always kept myself informed about new movie releases. But after downloading this app and spending 10 minutes browsing I couldn't find a single movie I had heard of or would want to watch (the only thing I recognized were some classic Superman and Daffy Duck cartoons).Most of these movies are free, but some are available as premium content for $4.99 a month. But even those movies I have never heard of. Plus by spending a small amount more you can have access to Amazon Prime Video which has a lot of great movies and TV (along with every other Amazon Prime feature). With the amount of really good streaming content out there (both free and paid) I can't see any reason to use this app."
2572,1,I play games constantly and quite frankly don't know what the big deal with this one is. All the jeweled games are better and not a blatant ripoff. Playrix matching games are a lot more challenging and you get to play forever for one purchase. Don't like anyof theese &#34;so-called&#34; free games. Would rate it no stars if I could. Also upset when I read about a lawsuit regarding naming rights. That's ludicrous...
2573,3,"Is there an end? Can someone finally say they won? This is like Chinese water torture. I give up! There was a show on tv and someone asked what they were playing and it was candy crush and they have been playing the same level for a week. I laughed because of the truth in the statement. The game brings out the worse in you (anxiety, high blood pressure, etc.) and you stop being attentive to others or your other responsibilities."
2574,2,"Dangerously addictive. When I was in the clutches of the game, several aspects of my life suffered. I stopped reading interesting articles on the train. I stopped observing my surroundings. I'd be irritable and antsy if I had to actually interact with someone instead of working on a level. I paid less attention to my family. I couldn't even watch TV without multi-tasking with candy crush.I finally deleted it from my phone and had to re-learn a bit of self discipline to detox this game out of my mind. I will never EVER let this back into my life - and I will certainly not allow my kids to play. This game is dangerous and adds ZERO value to life."
2575,3,"All my friends have been playing Candy Crush and tell me I have to play. It's great! It's awesome! It's fun! So I was told. I do NOT share these same feelings. Positive comments- the game is colorful, cute illustrations, interesting music. The first 10 levels are very easy and you advance to next level easily.After that, levels/boards are much harder and extremely frustrating. You can be stuck on one level for days. I like a challenging game but this is ridiculous. Also, I've noticed that the level's board changes with every replay. It's not like you are getting a chance to change some of the moves you made in the previous game. It is very frustrating. It is not my idea of fun or enjoyment.Also, the game initially provides you with ""gold bars & special boosters"" to help you. However, once you've used your free gold bars & boosters, you cannot get more unless you pay for them with real money. I am NOT going to spend money to play this game! Another thing I don't like is that you only get 5 lives per game session. Once you've lost your 5 lives, you cannot play again for a certain period of time. Why should I have to wait 30 minutes or an hour or more to continue playing? And again here, you can skip the wait and buy more lives for $.The last thing I dislike about this game is the Facebook ""share"" aspect of it. Ask your friends for help. Ask your friends to send you extra moves or an extra life. Share with your friends that you conquered a level etc. No, I don't want to ask my friends. No, I don't want to boast that I beat my friends' score; I JUST WANT TO PLAY A GAME FOR MY OWN FUN AND ENTERTAINMENT AND I WANT TO PLAY WHEN I HAVE THE TIME TO PLAY. I don't want to be told ""you can't play anymore now, come back later!""."
2576,2,"first, the game has you pay for more things to help getting past the levels. GREED....Then you have to wait if your lives are gone up to a whole day. People have figured out that if you reset your day and time a few hundred years out on your device, you can keep playing... REALLY....I just wanted to play when I have time......not fiddle with my time and wait till the game says I can play....I AM OUT!!!"
2577,2,"This magazine is such a disappointment now. When I subscribed, it was what the title proclaimed. Great! They'll sift thru the site and choose recipes many folks would like; and bring to the readers' attention unusual recipes they have missed on the site.Then they started adding ads. No problem and no surprise. How else could they continue?THEN...they started adding other stuff! In my Feb-Mar 2018 issue, the first recipe didn't appear until pg. 36 (out of 104 pgs., mind you). And what was this stuff? Fitness, lifestyle, tablescapes, kitchens renovations, utensils, baking with kids, and choosing healthy snacks (plus ads). FINALLY, we got a recipe!If I wanted all that ""stuff"", I'd subscribe to a mag that does it well (such as MARTHA STEWART LIVING). And, in fact, I do subscribe to MSL. AR does not do this sort of thing well, at all.I will NOT be re-subscribing to Allrecipes. It has turned into something unlike its charter. A very big disappointment. If you want recipes without extraneous barely-related material, AR is not for you.mbPS. TASTE OF HOME used to be ""no-advertising,"" too, but they had to add advertisements to survive. They've avoided padding their content, however. AR should take a lesson."
2578,1,"Just a horrible rag of a magazine. All the recipes do is to try to sell you the ingredients of their advertisers. There's no real discussion on the recipes, just a list of ingredients and some simple steps that you can find much more easily on the internet. Anyone who can buy this magazine on Amazon has enough internet skills to do much better with a quick Google search, and with less ads.Oh, and the food highlighted is either boring or fattening. In my six month subscription I found only 2 or 3 I would consider making.Save the trees this is printed on and save the fuel used for shipping."
2579,3,"I ordered a subscription of this magazine for my mother in December. It is now mid-March and she has yet to receive an issue. So I reported a problem saying the magazine still hadn't shown up. I got an email back saying the order I placed was for the digital version. NOPE! Nowhere in my order does it say I ordered the digital version. Nowhere at all. Furthermore, why the hell would you ask for a shipping address if it was a digital version?!?! And if I did order a digital version, where the hell is it? It's not on my kindle or anywhere in my email. And they don't have my mother's email."
2580,2,"I am much more interested in creative, healthy, low-fat, recipes... not more of the same old high-fat American diet. Everything I saw in this magazine I can get for free on the mobile app. Cancelling my subscription."
2581,3,"Had previously subscribed to print magazine a few years ago and liked it. Just subscribed to print version again, but the volume of ads has increased substantially. Had to go through 22 pages of ads before getting to first recipe, and there were tons more throughout. I realize ads keep subscription cost low, but with that many ads the magazine should be free. I'd rather pay more and get a magazine worth looking at.
Also, when I subscribed on Amazon, it said I'd get free digital subscription after I received my first print issue by entering info from magazine label. Now that offer seems to have disappeared. Very disappointed about that. Not happy."
2582,2,"Time magazine used to be a source of news, now it is just one photo spread after another. Most issues seem to be almost entirely dedicated to a single subject; and really, how many full page versions of the same person does one magazine need to have? The answer is that a photo costs less than paying reporters. If I wanted nothing but pictures, I would watch YouTube. I already gave up on Newsweek, and now I am letting Time magazine go as well."
2583,2,"As of December 2017, I cancelled my subscription. I wrote this to their feedback department, but they will learn nothing from anyone's feedback.The articles and magazine has trended down. As a small time reporter, Time has become a one sided, extremely biased, poorly written mess.The last straw was the person(s) of the year and the continuing destruction of the magazines credibility. Cancelling was the only option at this point after subscribing for years; I put up with a lot, but my hard earned cash will no longer go to this awful product."
2584,3,"I am very upset with the start date of my subscription. I aready receive Time Magazine and the subscription is over the end of Sept 2010. I was told I would start to receive the new subscription between Sept 22 and Oct 22, 2010. I have already received 3 duplicate copies. I wrote before and never heard an answer from AMAZON. I would appreciate if I get partial refund or my subscription is extended for an additional month. Thank you."
2585,3,"I ordered a one year subscription to Time through Amazon in May 2009. As of November 2009 I still have not received one issue. I contacted the seller's customer service and confirmed my order details, address, etc. They responded in September and said my order was somehow ""not on file,"" but it had since been ""resubmitted."" It's now two and a half months later, and I still have received nothing. My credit card was charged for the subscription six months ago. It seemed like a good deal to order the magazine through Amazon at the time, and it would have been... if they had actually delivered it! I have learned my lesson."
2586,3,"Ordered Time in March 2011 with auto-renewal. In December 2011 received an e-mail notifying me that my subscription would be automatically renewed. That was fine so I did nothing. Today I received 2 copies of Time, one with a subscription ending March 2012 and one with a subscription ending December 2012. OBVIOUSLY AUTO-RENEWAL DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY!!!"
2587,3,"This magazine was a very big disappointment. It is basically adds with a couple recipes thrown in. I wish there was some way to get my money back and cancel. I was really expecting some decorating idea or something. It was like watching a 30 min show and 20 minutes of it was commercials. I wish I could give it no stars. I know this sounds harsh and trust me I'm not one of those overly picky, like to complain types but boy was I disappointed."
2588,1,I had a two year subscription and didn't receive about half of them. Since it's not a monthly publication I never knew when to expect it but then I'd see a new issue at stores and would never receive my own copy. There really wasn't much of substance to the magazine so I guess I wasn't really that disappointed to not get much copy of advertisements. I wouldn't recommend.
2589,2,I have loved everything they do but the magazine really missed the mark. It’s full of advertisements and lifestyle type articles. I don’t need them to tell me how to live. It should have been full of decorating tips and ideas. I’m so sad I got a subscription and definitely won’t be renewing it.
2590,1,PUBLISHER HAS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE - STILL WAITING ON AN ORDER THAT WAS A BIRTHDAY GIFT. THEY GIVE LOTS OF LIP SERVICE AND ARE EXTREMELY RUDE AN BELLIGERENT!IF YOU ARE EXPECTING NORMAL DELIVERY SERVICE - DONT HOLD YOUR BREATH. WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN.
2591,3,"I had hopped that this would contain info about how to decorate, show some of the stores she shops in, hits on grouping, projects. More along the lines of hgtv or this old house burnt with jo's style. How she keeps organized, even talking about towns or communities in Texas that they've worked in and recommend. I love The show and the family, not the magazine."
2592,3,"The first installment of my subscription included 2 back-dates old issues. The product description is for a recurring annual subscription of monthly current issues. The fact that the subscription includes non-current issues is means that the product is defective. Similar to what other reviewers have said, I don’t want 3 issues (or 25% of my subscription) to come on the same day and for them to include old non-current and out of date issues. That’s not what I paid for, not what’s listed in the product page, nor what I expect. And to be clear, this is not a shipping issue. I’m trying hard to phrase my review to be clear that this is a defective product and not a shipping issue so my post doesn’t get removed again. This is a defective product. My suspicion is that many others have left similar feedback but it’s not reflected in the reviews for this reason."
2593,2,"I've always enjoyed Nat. Geo. magazine and have subscribed for many years. I just re-subscribed in September 2018, and on Nov.9,received the Sept,Oct and Nov issues all on the same day. Not sure if this is Amazon or Nat. Geo.but I think it's lousy to send back issues as part of my 12 issue subscription.Won't be renewing at the end of this year,whenever that is."
2594,2,"Having subscribed to this magazine a few years ago, I decided to try a digital version. I assumed that since I can read my purchased books in the Kindle cloud reader, I would also be able to read purchased magazines. WRONG! I must have missed that this is NOT AVAILABLE for reading on the cloud reader. Not having a Kindle device or a tablet, my only other option is trying to read on my phones. A HORRIBLE READING EXPERIENCE FOR THIS MAGAZINE! NO MORE MAGAZINES for me until Amazon fixes this major defect."
2595,3,I purchased this as a gift for my Dad last year. The magazine must be great since he asked me to keep the subscription going. My only gripe is that they can not seem to get the mailing address right no matter how many times he has asked for it to be corrected. He receives his magazine a month or two late due to this.
2596,3,"Poor customer service from NG. I used Amazon to renew my present subscription. When I received my first issue, I also received 2 older issues. These older issues of NG were ones I already had. It turns out I'm then only receiving a 10 month subscription to the magazine. When I inquired with customer service at NG, they blew me off and deferred me to Amazon. They should have taken care of it ASAP."
2597,1,"Deny Amazon's request to share your name and payment information. I have a 135 IQ, and it took me six months to figure out the scam. Here's my original review:I've been ripped off! This is bs.Low introductory price, then an auto renewal that is impossible to stop.This is a deal breaker. If they take another penny from me for this magazine, I'm severing ties with Jeff Besos.How much money do you need?PS. I will do my best to publicize this. And the call to the FTC will be followed by calls to my senators and congressmen. And Fox News."
2598,3,"Dislike online magazines. I believe I ordered this at a promotional rate as a trial. I forgot it was even there. When I did see it in my library, I tried to read it but found it cumbersome. Then I couldn't figure out how to cancel. Thus, everytime I see any special offers for online publications, I delete them as soon as I see them. Wish I could cancel the New Yorker."
2599,3,"I love the New Yorker and I love my kindle Voyage, but for some reason I cannot access online content for the New Yorker with my kindle Voyage subscription -I need a subscription for a Kindle Fire to access online content for free. I seem to need a digital subscription to the magazine for that. It is ridiculous."
2600,2,"I was given a reduced price mini subscription, with ZERO notification that I would have to ""opt out"" of the huge hundred-dollar full price I didn't request. Beware the dishonest ""opt out"" marketing ploy. I fell for it because I love the writing. But without notice, I was auto ""updated"", and could not cancel the order because they didn't give enough notice for me to do so. Convenient marketing ploy, that.Once burned, twice shy. I'd rather buy it at the news stall."
2601,2,"I was a subscriber to the Kindle edition for about nine years, but the publisher recently raised the monthly price from $2.99 to $8.99. To me, this tripling of the price seems excessive, especially since Conde Nast Is known for raking in the money and The New Yorker's circulation has probably gone through the roof in the current political climate. In the interest of spreading the wealth, I have chosen to support publishers more likely to appreciate the support and not engage in price-gouging."
2602,1,"SO Disappointed! SHAPE was my favorite magazine years ago. Didn't subscribe for 4 or 5 years because couldn't afford magazines. Was excited to get back to it, but now that I'm a few issues in, just throw it in the trash when it comes. This is a shadow of what it once was. Hardly any fitness and health info now. It's just another beauty magazine filled with ads for high-priced clothing and cosmetics. Miss the original badly. Don't waste your money on this one."
2603,2,"I have been a longtime Shape subscriber and am now cancelling my subscription (letting it run out) - last 3 issues contained all fluff, no workouts and more about beauty than anything else. As if there were not enough beauty magazines out there! Last issue I received was Oct 2018 - cover model was Alexa Chung (who I like) but is not a ""normal"" person to use for fitness inspiration - she is a model! Shape used to have weight loss stories - workouts, and food. Now I literally have ZERO articles I wanted to read 3 months in a row. I'm trying out a true fitness mag - Health or FitnessRx for my next subscription."
2604,2,"Shape used to be such a great magazine. They used to have detailed workout plans for cardio, strength training, and diet that were excellent, creative, and challenging with amazing photography. I remember their beach body workouts that were a part of an ongoing 5 month series and their total body workout plans that would be kicked off in January issues. Every issue would be full of cardio and strength training plans, along with express workouts and specific moves for arms, abs, etc.This magazine used to be so inspiring! Now when I flip through it, I actually get mad at how little this magazine invests in giving their readers a real workout plan. The magazine likes to write articles about the art of exercising but with little to no tangible exercise examples. It drives me nuts to get teased with a picture of a person working out only to turn the next page and see text descriptions of what to do. Seriously? This is a fitness magazine and you can’t provide a picture of the exercise you are recommending, you want me to read a text description of what to do? Another annoyance I find is how Shape will feature pages and pages of glamorous fitness models posing and flexing their lean muscles in trendy workout clothes, along with text describing how great a workout you are going to have. After eagerly turning the page to reach the actual workout ‘section’, I see one page crammed with tiny photos. Shape will only dedicate a single page to the exercises after the huge buildup. They don’t even lay out the exercise photos with enough space to separate out the moves, they are smashed together and shrunk down. Also, the exercises are not that attainable - some of the moves are complicated but with the limited photos, you are left puzzling over how to move from step 1 to 2. And that is only if you get any kind of exercise plan. I’ve just flipped through a years worth of Shape mags that I have been needing to recycle, and it is not predictable to see any workout plan laid out per issue. If you enjoy reading about exercising, but not interested in actually doing it, then this mag is fine. But I wish Shape would make big changes to their direction. I am so profoundly disappointed in what it has become and will no longer subscribe to Shape."
2605,3,"I bought this as a cheap subscription for my fitness studio. I haven't looked at the magazine in a couple of years. I forgot how lame it is, and now it is even more ads than ever. Hardly any reading content at all, and very few exercises and very little diet and nutrition information. My clients like to read something while they are warming up on the bike when they are waiting for me, but this isn't worth their time or mine."
2606,1,"This magazine is not a fitness magazine. I counted 63 add pages out of 136. And most of the content is beauty and food. There is one workout on 2 pages and like 5 pages of a model who I guess works out, but you have to go the website to get that work out. Ridiculous. I bought this hoping for information and inspiration related to get in shape. This is not that magazine. No wonder it was $5 and is failing. Do not buy this magazine if you actually want information on getting in shape."
2607,3,"While I enjoy reading Woman's World, I don't like the digital version of it. I want to do the Sudoku and crossword puzzles they publish and I have yet to figure out how I could print that page so that I could. The digital subscription barely saves any money over the print version, so I really have no motivation to continue with it. Three stars for content, one star for digital weakness."
2608,3,"I don't normally write extremely bad reviews, but it's necessary in this case. I have received Woman's World magazine since 2002 and thoroughly enjoyed it; however, delivery has been sporadic in recent months. In fact, I haven't received an issue since February 19, 2018, even though I've contacted customer service and I can see that they extended my subscription.I see that an electronic version is available and I would have been interested in receiving the magazine as an e-version, but this experience has been a total turn-off. If they didn't want to continue selling the print version, they should have just said so."
2609,3,"Every year I get my mother-in-law this magazine for Christmas. Last year was no exception. Today when I presented her with her subscription for the coming year, she thanked me and said how much she missed it last year. Turns out, she didn't receive a single issue all last year even though I clearly paid for it in December of 2015 for the entire coming year. I just paid for it again for 2017 without realizing she didn't receive it the entire previous year. I will be contacting someone soon."
2610,3,"While my family and I like the magazine, we have not subscribed in years. There are simply much more affordable magazines out there and online. Out of the blue, my mother received a notice from WW that looked just like a bill saying she owed $159.90, with a June 7th payment date WHAT?!!! At first, I thought it was a scam by some unknown entity.As it turns out, it was just a sneaky way for WW to try to get people to buy a year or two's subscription. I am certain there are others who were confused by this mailing, and may have been deceived. Bad form, WW!"
2611,3,"The magazine itself is fine. I bought for my wife, she loves it. It is light, easy reading. We are having problems getting it delivered. Got a message from the EBSCO - Magazines Express, that there is not a problem. I say there is, we have only received 2 of 7 magazines and the comment from them is..."" Your subscription started on blank date and ends on blank date.."" They offered no help or any type of restitution."
2612,1,AWFUL!! Sign up for this readers digest you will get a ton of junk mail! This is the only thing I get deliverered to my boyfriends house in my name and because of that now I get a ton of useless ads and crap I don't want there in my name so it's easy to identify the problem. Don't buy unless you want your mailbox full of crap you don't want/need.
2613,1,"The information in this MAGAZINE is a joy to read and includes current non-fictional information, biographies, jokes, photos, and so much more. It’s smaller size makes it handy to keep in a purse or larger pocket. There is even a large print version.We had been RD subscribers for years prior to moving, so when Amazon offered this offer, we eagerly signed up for ONE subscription.(However we received TWO subscriptions!)Why only ONE STAR? The RD magazine would get 4 or 5; however we gave it only ONE as a warning. Our subscription, as mentioned in other reviews, initiated a ton of junk mail offers for additional products/books arrived by e-mail and by USPS! There was no requirement to buy these products, but let’s face it, junk mail appropriately earned it’s name. But, the nightmare got worse!We recently received a package containing a book (untitled) that was the first volume of many to follow. The book cost $10+ tax, but was free for the first volume, $0.00. There was no price listed for the following untitled books. NOR was there any way to opt out of further issues!!! The [only] ONE instruction included and was to return the “payment slip” with a check (bank information). Talk about the RED FLAGS for FRAUD!!!Please note: The company requesting this information was not Reader’s Digest nor Amazon... another red flag. And there wasno way to return the book or auto-shipments of further volumes! Not even information on the titles or genre.Just a friendly warning..."
2614,1,"Love the mag, hate the company. Ordered 2 yr subscription thru Amazon. The subscription shouldend Feb 2013. RD had it ending in Nov 2012. Emailed Amazon, told them of the problem, and afterseveral tries, they go it fixed.Several months ago I noticed the expir date had mysteriously ""slipped"" to Jan 2013, from Feb 2013I contacted Amazon yet again, and once again Amazon got it fixed. I fully expect that one or twoof the remaining issues will get ""lost"" in the mail.Moral of the story: If you subscribe to Reader's Digest WATCH THEM VERY VERY CLOSELY. And,Amazon was great in helping out.More? Ordered a RD subscription myself and one for a friend. At year end I noticed I had paidfor 3, not 2, subscriptions. Never got a satisfactory answer from RD. This was several years ago.Another one? When my mother passed away I had RD sent to me for the remainder of the sub.When it expired RD started sending renewal notices. Having dealt with them before I just filed each one.After a few renewal notices, they changed into what looked like a bill. Then this ""non-bill"" morphedinto a bill, the came the demand for payment on this ""bill"". That was followed by a threat to turnher over for collection. One letter to them informing them of their ethics problem stopped the ""collection"".Go on the web and key in ""Readers Digest Complaints"" and see what pops up. It'll be a ton of them.After doing just that I learned that RD apparently cut EVERYONE's subscription expiration date bya month after printing a double issue. Of course, when they do a ""double issue"" they don't do anissue for the next month. Then, they use that as a lame excuse to take one month off your subscription.And, from what I read, I'd have never gotten the problem fixed had not Amazon went to bat for me once again.Just go on the web and take a look for yourself."
2615,3,"We did not even get the first issue. Emailed and they wanted me to do all the work. No apologies We had this magazine years ago and it was amazing. It is a good magazine but the customer service was poor. They did want to extend the subscription by 3 months. All I wanted was my first issue. Oh, it comes as 2 issues. Sept./October. Will send you Sept. but it will take 3 weeks. Ok, do the math. I am getting that issue anyway so in 3 weeks I would be getting the issue I was owed."
2616,1,HEY!!!!! Where have all my issues gone? This is B.S. I paid for them they should be in the cloud. Why wasn't I notified about this mass dumping of magazines? How about a refund for past unread issues. I subscribed to RD so I could read at my leisure now they are gone. You owe everyone an explanation.
2617,1,I have a problem with having my account charged for something I didn't intend to buy. I signed up for a 1 year subscription magazine as a gift for my Mom that I cancelled to find out Ive continued to pay for the kindle edition that I didn't even know I was signed up for. I will be sure to leave a good word for you guys to family and friends. Find another way to do business.
2618,2,"I contacted the magazine NUMEROUS times to ask them why I was no longer receiving their magazine and they never bothered to fix/address/remedy the situation. I probably got 5 magazines from my ""12 month"" subscription. With generally declining magazine subscriptions, as people move more and more to digital, you'd think they'd jump at the chance to help a customer who wants to subscribe. But no, they do not. Will not subscribe again."
2619,3,"I'm glad I got this on a lightning deal, and I paid standard subscription price I would be pretty upset. Most of the magazine is full of advertisements for drugs, and other useless products that are not related to food at all. Most of them ended up in the garbage.When there are so many advertisements in a magazine, you have to ask yourself why are you paying a subscription to be advertised to. Unacceptable."
2620,2,"Apparently the entire world (except me) thinks all recipes should contain peppers and cilantro, both of which I don't like. I don't watch cooking shows so I don't care who these people are, how their homes are decorated, etc. Unfortunately the magazine is loaded with all the above. I have yet to try a recipe that's I'm excited about after a year subscription, but then I haven't tried a lot. Only cost $5 but I won't buy it again."
2621,2,"I love the magazine. My issue is that Hearst doesn't ship it in the clear, protective wrap. It comes mangled. The 3rd issue was torn up and creased horribly. It looked like someone stomped on it. I have ordered it before and it came protected it. Major let down. I'm not renewing due to this. Who wants to pay for an item that comes looking like it came out of a garbage can?"
2622,1,"As stated by others, the content in the magazine is...lacking, to say the least. Honestly, the emails they send out for free are a better option than the magazine sometimes. I guess this is just one example of print dying: pay for hard copies of ads but get the articles in your inbox.However, that's not ALL you'll be paying for. Even after cancelling my auto-renewal (I'm a sucker for that price), I signed up for a ""free"" giveaway they were doing on their website. Hey, free tools are free tools! After I filled out the entry form, it brought me to a page that said, in essence, ""Would you like to subscribe? Give us your details and we'll bill you later!"" Naturally, I opted to not fill the form out and just closed out of the tab. But Family Handyman is like a garbage disposal hellbent on money. It wants your money. It NEEDS your money. It's sole purpose in life is to get your money and dispose of it on paper leaflets filled with ads. And Family Handyman was not happy it didn't get its money. So, about a week later, I got a renewal notification in my email inbox. I replied to them, saying that I did NOT want the subscription and that I was already subscribed. A few days later, they sent me a bill for $10. Now, I'm a disabled man. I am not made of money. I was born far, far away from the garden where the money tree grows. My income is limited, to say the least. So, while $10 may not seem like a lot...to someone who gets $34 a month that DOESN'T go to rent...that's almost a quarter of my monthly income. And Family Disposalman needed that money for ads. I emailed them AND filled out a form on their website to cancel the renewal and what was left of my subscription. A few days later, they acquiesced. I somehow managed to slay the monster and keep my precious ten dollars.The moral of this story is that, if you want a magazine mostly full of product pitches and predatory practices, go ahead and put your money down on the barrel for Family Handyman. If you want something decent, just go watch old This Old House reruns."
2623,2,"Amazon really needs to cycle through it's highest rated reviews every few years. Maybe this magazine was great back in the early 2000's, but today is it nothing more than a advertisement rag posing as a DIY magazine.I have received 2 issues and other than the cover article, it seems everything else is a tiny little blurb amidst a sea of other party ads. There is very, very little substance or instruction to be had. I would much rather pay you are higher price subscription for more content and less ads, than the current model that Handyman currently has.I'll look elsewhere for my DIY interests."
2624,2,"This magazine is pretty useless. I totally agree the ad to actual content is very weak. The first issue I received had maybe 3 projects available in them. One how to remove shingles from a roof faster. Second being how to build a planter box. And, the third, how to build a slide out drawer/storage for under a bed. All of these things can be quickly found and multiple forms on Pinterest with fewer ads. I will not be renewing my sub with this magazine."
2625,1,"Ordered a 1 year subscription, in August, and received one magazine. I emailed Amazon about this problem and they forwarded my complaint/issue to Reader's Digest. No word from Reader's and it's been 10 days. Reader's Digest used to be a respected publisher back in the 70's & 80's but, it appears that they have really gone down hill. I wish I would have read the other reviews related to subscription problems as I never would have ordered this magazine from them. Buyer Beware."
2626,3,"The very first issue I received had a wide red band across the envelope with it that said, ""OFFER EXPIRATION NOTICE"". Inside the envelope was a red piece of paper saying, ""OFFER EXPIRATION NOTICE"". The renewal letter makes statements such as, ""LAST CHANCE BONUS"". After coming to my order, I get the information that should have been provided be I ordered, which was that this subscription will automatically renew itself charging the credit card that was used originally. I will be confirming that this is a monthly subscription or I may cancel it per the magazine's Money-Back-Guarantee plus contact my credit card company requesting a total refund."
2627,1,"I purchased a non-renewing subscription last year. The subscription was set to run from November 2012 to November 2013. In October 2013, I received the following letter from HGTV Credit & Collection Department:---------------------------------------------------------Dear ...Your delinquent account with us has been brought to my attention for collection.""Subscription Suspended for Non-Payment"", that's what our records reflect. When we agreed to bill you later, we anticipated that you would forward payment upon receipt of our invoice. A review of our files shows that you have failed to respond to our numerous requests for payment.Take a moment now to settle your obligation with us and we will promptly reinstate your subscription.Sincerely,HGTV MagazineCustomer ServiceP.S. To pay online go to pay.hgtvmag.com---------------------------------------------------------I never agreed to a renewal. It appears that the business practice used by this publisher is to scare people in to renewing by sending them a credit/collection letter. HGTV has forever lost my business and I will never recommend them to anyone. I've canceled my subscription via Amazon. Only time will tell if they use low-ball business tactics by sending this to an outside collection agency."
2628,3,"To many adds, everything is more modern…If you like country/crafts this is not the magazine for you! I guess I just miss the old HGTV where they actually showed you neat things to make. If you live in a big city and want to make a pot garden…ok..get this magazine. This country girl didn't like it..can you tell? Lol."
2629,2,I will not be ordering any more magazine subscriptions from Amazon. I was promised there would be a cancellation button if I wanted to quit this subsciption and not have it auto-renew. There is not. The phone number shown on the page is disconnected. This is so wrong. Very poor customer service by Amazon. HGTV magazine is a good product but not what I was looking for.
2630,3,"Nothing but ads. There are about two actual articles in each issue. The rest is filled with pictures of things you can from their partners. Not even any features from any network stars. Not worth paying for at all, they have more content on their free website."
2631,2,"I've received 3 magazines and all of them can be summed up as basically one giant advertisement for paint. Specifically rooms and front doors. and some common sense information thrown in, like this month's advice on how to wash a car and patch a beach tube. Really? I subscribed thinking it would be more hardcore gardening (and instead the gardening sections are for entry level planters. This month, for example, was daisy vs. chamomile (hint, one is an edible herb!), and a shovel vs. a spade (hint one is pointy...I wonder what on earth it could be used for???? ect.) and the home improvements are just advertisements to buy buy from their sponsors. They do copy beauty magazines cheap vs. expensive comparison which was interesting, but ::spoilers:: the cheap one is almost always the ugly item.I was not impressed and after this month have cancelled my subscription. clearly 34yr old females are not their target audience...if you order this thinking you'll get advice on DIY home improvement, how to do more earth friendly living, or how to have the perfect back yard think again. I will stick to watching the cable shows at the gym."
2632,3,"The quality of the Magazine has diminished compared to what it used to be. My Mother was a long time subscriber of this magazine and I used to love it too. The paper and binding were heavier and used staples to bind in the past. I used to archive and collect the older SL mags, But I see no reason to do that any longer. The magazine seems to have more ads, less quality Southern content than it used to have. I cannot recommend this magazine any longer at this price. I have reverted to Garden and Gun Magazine for quality Southern material with archival quality.Most of the photos and covers they show on Amazon item page looks to be from the OLD magazine setup look & feel. Seems they are riding on the old quality while delivering the new lesser quality."
2633,3,"It has been a month since placing the order but I've yet to receive my first issue. I do believe the disclaimer said 4 to 6 weeks so I'm still optimistically waiting. Unfortunately, when I mentioned this subscription price deal to a few local friends, they responded with their tales of difficulty getting their Southern Living subscriptions delivered, even when ordering through the magazine, not Amazon. So we will see.... it was just a $5 gamble."
2634,2,"I was looking forward to leafing through Southern Living again. Got first issue today and promptly cancelled. A dozen or so brief lifeless articles, a handful of recipes, and the rest is ads. This is the spectacular 50th Anniversary issue too! I'd cancel even it had been free, to save the trees and a trip to the recycle bin. Maybe Time doesn't understand this, but we don't pay to look at advertisements when there's so little of value between them."
2635,3,"Did not receive all issues, & the one I did get arrived months late. No easy way to report or remedy this either. And it auto-renewed 3 months later (as advertised, but I thought I would at least receive my 3 months of issues before that happened, since the only issue I received arrived months late. Nope; it renewed exactly 3 months after my original order was confirmed. Crappy system, full of bugs."
2636,3,"I still enjoy reading this magazine, despite the changes that have lowered the quality, but I may have to cancel my subscription. There are so many problems: missing issues, with no explanation given, late delivery, download problems. I am frustrated and disappointed."
2637,2,"I never really thought much of EW- just a rag that kept me up to date on entertainment news. Recently a new editor (Henry Goldblatt) took over and the magazine became a true disaster. They've eliminated top box office and other charts... I think they figure that you can get that information in a more timely manner from the web... But let's be honest, you can get everything in a more timely manner from the web. The articles are superficial and the format annoying (it's hard to tell where one article begins and another ends). They've also eliminated reader feedback- and maybe that's because everyone has stopped reading. It takes me 5 [painful] minutes to get through this magazine. I won't be renewing!"
2638,3,"I have been an Entertainment Weekly subscriber for 4 or 5 years. About two weeks ago, the new issue didn't arrive. I gave it a few days. Sometimes it arrives late. Always look forward to it.Usually I contact them and ask them to resend it. About 9 times out of 10, they'll resend a duplicate copy of an issue I already received. I tell them in my request what issue date, what's on the cover, yet they almost always send the wrong one. If that's not bad enough, this time I contacted them and was informed that my subscription ended TWO MONTHS AGO. Without any notice for those two months, I continued receiving issues and then they just stopped. In the past, they would send a letter and have a special notice attached to the magazine saying to renew. So I contact EW to tell them they made a mistake and never notified me. They tell me to renew. By having to renew I now will not receive another magazine for another TWO MONTHS. I told them that they made a mistake and should rectify it immediately. They told me all they can do is have me renew. They're not apologetic. They're not helpful. It's a shame the writers and editors of the magazine are at the mercy of their customer service team."
2639,3,"Not sure I'll renew again. What kind of thoughtless entertainment magazine publishes such a blatant, unavoidable The Walking Dead spoiler on the cover just 5 days after the episode aired? I opened my mailbox and it was right there. In this age of DVRs and streaming, is it really necessary to ruin the surprise for many of us? Entertainment Weekly, you are thoughtless!"
2640,2,This used to be my absolute favorite! I would count down the days until Saturday when I could read it. Ever since the summer when they took away interactivity the magazine has gone to crap. It is now absolutely unreadable on my Kindle. The type is too small and the pages don't even take up the entire screen . I am canceling my subscription of 20 years since the magazine is now unreadable.
2641,1,"The Economist is a great magazine. This subscription service is terrible. They processed my renewal too early and I started receiving two copies of the magazine each week. When I notified them, they said they fixed it. Then I didn't receive any magazines at all. Go straight to The Economist to subscribe. This service isn't worth it."
2642,3,I bought this for the audio edition which you can listen to when purchased from the publisher directly. No audio was on offer here. Had to buy it again directly from the publisher in order to listen to it. Wasted my money. I should have carefully checked before purchase.
2643,3,"I enjoy reading the print edition when I am traveling, so I thought the Kindle edition would be perfect. However, the formatting is awful for a Kindle, and I had to zoom in to be able to read anything. Then, it was too easy to accidentally scroll off of the page that I was reading since I had to zoom so much. I am not sure why publishers think they can just throw their printed versions onto a mobile device without looking at the end result. If you are going to sell a product, at least test it. I can't believe that anybody who tested this would have let it out to the public."
2644,2,"I have been subscribing to The Economist for years and it is a great magazine. Truly five stars. I also like the electronic edition when traveling as I can read the current issue on my tablet computer. It's also nice when my mailed copy is a little late in arriving as it's hard enough to get through the magazine in the 6 days before the next one comes, so getting it a day or two later means it's hard to do it justice.So why one star? This subscription looked like a way to save a very small amount of money, but the hidden cost is that you don't get the electronic edition. Bad tradeoff. I had to cancel this subscription and subscribe direct with the publisher to get the full package."
2645,3,"The Economist is a great magazine and I love it, so this one-star rating is based purely on AMAZON'S AWFUL SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE. For starters, I was not given a heads up when the original order was set to auto-renew, unlike every other Amazon service (like subscribe & save). Second and most importantly, by subscribing to the magazine through Amazon instead of directly through The Economist, YOU CANNOT ACCESS THE WEBSITE, DIGITAL VERSION, OR KINDLE VERSION. So you're paying $150/year for the paper magazine and nothing else, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. And this is NOT laid out in any of the descriptions or info on the product page, so you don't know unless you read these reviews, or until it's too late."
2646,2,"I accepted the 30 day trial offer, though canceled the subscription because of the lack of features. I've read Vogue all my life. When many pther kids were reading Highlights magazine, I had Vogue. The reason I cancelled is due to the lack of features which degrades the expereince. For the print edition, I enjoy a full read then tear out the images or articles I find inspiring. (Called scratching in the creative world) With the digital edition there is no way to make a bookmark, nor is there a way to clip articles or images you like into notes. There is no way to share to a clipping site, like Pinterest, where I could refer to view saved images. I will say amazon customer service perfectly handled canceling on the trial. I called because I could not find the order under my account. ... If this had bookmarking, and saving or sharing features for articles and images I would choose this over paper simply to avoid the recycle cycle. However, my old binder filled with magazine clippings rules over the digital version for a better experience."
2647,2,"I waited two month and didn't get a single issue. Customer service is terrible. When I contacted them several times, no one replied. Don't count on Amazon either. My complaints got no response at all. The most ridiculous thing is when I try to cancel it, they only give me half my money back. But I didn't even get one!!! I will never use this company again. Nor will I ever subscribe magazine from Amazon anymore. Just terrible experience."
2648,2,"I used to love Vogue. I'm creative I like design and I it always helped that it's spurred my imagination. I had often torn out one or two outfits and copied them. I've already received two of these magazines and there's so many ads it seems like more than in the past. The liberal nonsense articles in it, including nonsense political agenda are a waste of money I'm cancelling it."
2649,1,"So I usually get magazines through the mail (old-fashioned way) and overall I had gotten great results. I believed that if I got a magazine subscription through internet it would be easier and faster. Was I wrong! First of all it took almost 2 months to get the first magazine, and when I did I got a 2 month old magazine, and up to now I have yet to receive the august issue which came out to stores almost three weeks ago. I definitely DO NOT recommend getting magazine subscriptions through anywhere else besides the ancient, yet effective way of mail."
2650,3,"I never asked for this subscription, I never knew of this subscription and then I was emailed and told if I had to tell them if I was not going to renew .... they would have charged my credit card for a renewal I never asked for had I not responded to the email. Some people may just delete the email and then get charged for something on a card they do not monitor well for something they never ordered. I am shocked! this type of advertising should never be done. No subscription should be made for anyone except by the person themselves, even a ""free trial one"" as they always mean you will get billed next month!"
2651,1,"These products contain fragrances and dyes which are a super duper no-no!!I have bad allergies and a history of mild eczema, but my allergies have caused eczema to flare up around my eyes. What is even worse is I took to these products to HYDRATE my skin. But what really happened is the fragrance in them caused my eyes to completely flare up and become swollen, dry, red, and itchy.Seriously, if you want some actual rose water, Gaia purity Moroccan rose water is the way to go. Don’t damage your beautiful skin with fragrances and dye."
2652,2,"I dont get the hype. Im one of those that had a reaction. My skin started peeling off. I have patches of skin peeling off on my eyelids, my chin and around my mouth. I had a burning senstaion before the peeling happened as well and didnt think it could be this causing the trouble until i read the other reviews here. I wasn't using anything else new. I was hoping it ll be better than regualr rose water, but good god! Was i wrong! Im going back to my previous heritage rose water qith glycerin."
2653,3,"I bought these sprays to use as toners under hyaluronic acid serum. The rosewater spray has such an unpleasant scent that I wouldn't want anyone's nose in my neck while I'm wearing it. I couldn't stand myself while wearing it.The green tea spray is a little better, more neutral but still not a clean aroma. Neither spray makes my skin feels particularly refreshed; both feel heavy. I recommend passing on these and getting a straightforward, fresh cucumber hyaluronic spray."
2654,2,"I wanted to like this product, but I would not purchase it again. I was expecting a fine spray mist, but the spray comes out in large blobs. Maybe this particular sprayer was received malfunctioning. Spray seems perfumey and sticky. Don't get it on your lips, bad taste."
2655,1,"Don't waste your money- this is just a product with a lot of unnecessary hype. I used to use Mario Badescu's spot treatment as a teenager, because spas and dermatologist offices in New york city would carry them- so I would buy them but it never worked well for my skin. Similarly, this product is full of unnecessary chemicals that will dry out your skin, do yourself a favor and buy a different rose water that doesn't have all the additions."
2656,3,"As of this month’s subscribe & save delivery, this product is completely different than what I used to get. The original Cover Dot Acne patches were thin and you could even wear them out in public if you had a nasty blemish. The new “replacement” version is more like the Nexcare acne patch — they are thicker and do not stay adhered as well. And they are noticeable. You are not going to want to leave the house wearing one of these on your face.Unfortunately, I didn’t open the package and see they were different until my old (better) product was already gone, so I had to open and use a patch from the new pack (something is better than nothing). Otherwise, I would be returning these to get a refund."
2657,1,"I have temperamental skin and I bought these before the new packaging and loveeeddd them. But I bought a new set after the new packaging and I HATE them. I bought multiple sheets because I loved them so much and I swear they changed the product also. It does not absorb the pimple like they used to and they leave this greasy reside that feels like it's from the adhesive. Seriously, don't waste your money."
2658,3,"They've changed! They no longer blend into my light skin and getting them off the sheet is a pain! The color and texture is now similar to Band-aide sheer and it's obvious I am wearing it. There is also less hydrocolloid gel on each dot. You used to be able to tear one square off at a time, tear half the paper backing from that dot and then apply. Now you have to carefully tear paper that is behind three dots and then carefully take them off to apply. A HUGE PAIN!"
2659,3,"Works great on whiteheads.. not AT ALL on cystic acne. Ive used them 3 nights in a row on my cystic acne and they havent made any difference at all, didnt turn white, didnt get any better..nothing. I did have one whitehead that went almost completely away in a couple hours, so if thats your only problem then you're in good shape."
2660,3,"This did not work at all for me. I think maybe it would work really well for someone who uses foundation and wants to cover their pimples as to not make them worse by covering them in make-up but I don't wear make-up like that so it's really just a guess. I tried this product two nights in a row, and if anything my pimple was worse."
2661,3,"PhenoxyethanolPhenoxyethanol is a common personal care preservative. It is an effective bactericide and has recently been widely used to replace parabens, especially in natural products. Phenoxyethanol has been found to be toxic to the body even in small doses.In order to create it, the known skin carcinogen, ethylene oxide is combined with a phenol (a chemical compound which is also considered a carcinogen). The process of creating phenoxyethanol may (depending on each manufacturer’s production methods) produce the dangerous by- product called 1,4 dioxane. The EPA has established 1,4 dioxane is a probable human carcinogen. The FDA describes it as being able to depress the nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea. The product’s Material Safety Data Sheet says that it is harmful if inhaled or swallowed or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage. The Chemical Toxicity Database lists that phenoxyethanol may cause central nervous system depression, kidney damage, skin irritation, headaches, dizziness, nausea and drowsiness. If inhaled it may cause respiratory and digestive tract irritation. Japan has banned the use of it in all cosmetics."
2662,2,"I am 56 years-old. I bought this product because I was tired of paying $75 and up for skin care products at department and cosmetic stores. I have been using this retinol cream for two weeks now and absolutely love it! The cream has softened, smoothed, lifted, and firmed my skin and has made it more radiant. It is even eliminating clogged pores and reducing some milia I have. It is the best skin care product I have ever used, and that's significant because I have tried almost everything over the years. The price point for this product is incredible, as well. I am going to order another bottle of this retinol cream today so that I have one on hand when the first bottle runs out. Because I was so impressed with this product, I ordered the three other products by LilyAna Naturals that are offered on Amazon -- the eye cream, the vitamin C serum, and the moisturizer. And I am equally impressed with these products! Throw in the fact that I paid less for all four products than what I previously paid for just one product at a department store, and you have a completely devoted LilyAna Naturals customer.Update:I should have known better than to post a review of a skin care product so soon after receiving it. After I finished my first bottle of the retinol moisturizer, I ordered a second one. I thought the second one smelled a little odd when I opened it, but I wasn't certain. Anyway, here I am a few weeks later with a face full of acne, some of it cystic. It has to be either this product and/or the Lilyana Naturals vitamin c serum I started using at the same time I started using the retinol cream. I haven't had a breakout like this since I was a teenager, but it is just as upsetting and frustrating now as it was then, even more so because you kind of expect it when you're a teenager, but not when you're in your 50's. It can only be the Lilyana Naturals products that are causing this reaction because the the only other things I use on my face are the same cleanser and foundation that I've used for years. At this point all I can do is stop using all skin care products until the acne clears, and then I will have to go back to the department store products I was using before. I even stocked up on the retinol cream and the vitamin c serum because I was initially so excited about the results that I was getting. But now I'm too scared to use any of it, so it will all end up going to waste. I should have known that if it sounds too good to be true, it is, and you get what you pay for."
2663,3,"Horrible product! Put this retinol cream on at night and woke up with a horrible breakout of small red bumps all over my face. I read other reviews and thought it was possibly just their skin being to sensitive, but I also broke out all over my face and I have never had problems with any other face creams I have tried in the past."
2664,3,"This is the second time I’ve purchased this cream. The first time I really liked it. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t cause any irritations, burning or itching. It didn’t have a smell and I felt that it gave my skin a good amount of moisture without being oily. However, after receiving my second bottle I found the product to be extremely inconsistent with my first experience. The product itself is gritty (as you can see in the picture provided) and has a strong fragrance. I only put it on my face once before I had noticed the odd texture and it bothered my skin almost instantly. I’m very disappointed with the inconsistency."
2665,2,"Based on the reviews, I was so excited. An all natural moisturizer that many has stated worked wonders! But for me it was a no, i have combination skin and have tried brand name to drug store moisturizers. Think la mer to neutrogina. I wanted to try a more natural route. Day one: felt great! Moisturized without oilDay 2: slight tingle and rednessDay 3: decided to alternate and use cetaphil to give my skin a break. Used cream only in the amDay 4: redness under both eyes and so ITCHY!!!Day 6 red swollen dry patches that are itchy!Day 8: patches are bigger and more irritatedI have never reacted this way to a moisturizer and while the photos dont show the swelling or both eyes, it does show the worsening in the redness. one picture is from day 4 then day 6.I will not continue to use this past a week."
2666,1,"I used this product and thought it was okay. I had heard great things from friends about this moisturizer. When it ran out, I purchased another container from a local retailer and it was A COMPLETELY different product than the one I purchased on Amazon originally. Because I had never tried this product before, I didn’t know there was anything wrong. My advice...don’t buy any or skin care or beauty products off Amazon. I know I won’t be any longer."
2667,3,"I’m not sure why but I have tried so many neutrogena products without any success (sunscreen, facial cream/gel, etc.) Even when it claims to not irritate skin. And this caused me to break out within the first week of using it. I have took a break and tried again and my face broke out again. Not very happy.I guess my one star is for the scent. It’s rather strong but it does smell fresh."
2668,2,I was recommended this product and it seemed to really be high quality plus you get ao little for such a high price. After only 2 applications my face was red and started peeling in a rash. I would not recommend if you have even the slightest bit of sensistive skin. My face burned for days and i immediately stopped usage. I can't see the option to return but I want to.
2669,3,"So, I love this lotion, the real one. I have very sensitive skin and this was recommended to me by dermo. I loved it from the beginning and it worked really well to keep me moisturized. I started ordering it from amazon and had reordered maybe 9-10 times when I received a jar that was not at all the same product. When I opened the jar it had a strong chlorine smell. I sent it back to amazon for a replacement and the next jar was the same. I had used about 20 jars of this stuff before these two, I knew something was weird. I took it to my dermo and she agreed that it was off. I used it for a little to see if the ingredients were the same( before I showed my dermo)... maybe new formula? But it wasn’t as moisturizing and left my face with that smell that my boyfriend even pointed out. I went to target and bought one and of course, no scent, exactly how I remembered. Amazon refunded me the jar of whatever the heck I was putting on my face but be aware, if you get this and it has any hint of a smell, especially chlorine, send it back, that’s not right. I did also compare ingredients to see if they had changed anything and it all read the same. The product I got either went bad or was not the same thing, end of story. I’d give the real product a 5 across the board but just be careful with what you get. Maybe try target first to confirm what it should be like."
2670,3,The gel in the container should be blue not white and should smell much different. I bought this originally from Target and loved it. When I opened this container from Amazon the gel was white and had a different scent. I would not buy this. I am unsure what is in the container but it is not the same stuff if you buy it from a store.
2671,3,"This is my 3rd jar of this lotion, it is bt far THE BEST LOTION IV EVER OWNED... well up until this last jar. Its not the same formula!!From the first time putting it on i could tell something was diffrent about it. I kept using it though, a day or 2 later my arms, legs n face are broke out in dry itchy bumps. Zit like.I am NOT happy and the item cannot be returned so now its trash n iv wasted my money.Ill be going to the store today to buy a new jar and lll update this review and add pictures so u can see the diffrence because im sure there will be!"
2672,3,"I really hate to give this product such a low rating. I've been using this product for a week now and bought it because of all the spectacular reviews. I put it on every night before bed. I always feel a burning sensation but I still continue applying it (I figured it was normal). After doing this for a week, I notice that my eczema has increased rather than decreased and I don't see any skin differences that I was hoping for. I'm still considering trying it again or just dumping it :/"
2673,1,"Let me start by saying it's pretty rare for me to have acne. I might have one or two pimples on my face a month, and it's usually during a stressful work week. I have chronic dry skin on my face from acne medication when I was younger so I use a daily lotion on my face. I have been using Olay to meet this need for almost two years, but sometimes on a high wind day or during winter months the moisturizing benefits didn't last a full day.At first opening of the product, it has a pleasant smell and appears very thick. Nevertheless, based on the reviews, I went ahead and applied a small amount to my hand then face. It felt somewhat oily when I applied it. By the end of the work day, my temples, nose, and upper cheeks were unusually oily. The next day I had a pimple. I wanted to like the product and I thought it may be just my body getting used to something new so I used it for two more days. By the fourth morning, I had a full on breakout of unsightly acne in multiple locations on my face and I haven't used it since.If you're prone to acne or have large pores, I'd think twice before using this product."
2674,1,"DO NOT put this product on your face. I have very sensitive skin and rosacea. After reading a lot of good reviews, I decided to try this product. It made my skin break out horribly and become inflamed. I regret ever using this on my face. Weeks later after I stopped using it and my skin is just now starting to clear up from this product. Awful!"
2675,3,"Didnt suit me at all, made me break out badly (im using it as a foot cream now!) I have sensitive and very dry skin, currently with just a few acne here and there. I thought this should be one of the safest moisturizers for me to try but it turned out not useful for me. Also, it doesnt absorb in my skin at all and if i rub it much it feels very rubbery, yet just sits on my skin. Going by the rave reviews, i believe i'm one of the very few this product suit, but since you could also be 'one of the few', I suggest everyone trying this product to get a smaller packaging or sample first."
2676,3,"As the description states, it treats, it doesn't cure. As soon as you stop applying the product, the fungus will return. Also, your underwear and pants will get an awful odor like cooking oil that will stay with your clothes for a while even after many washes."
2677,3,"I have used this product for over a week for Jock Itch, and I have seen little to no result. The bottle is very small, and the product is very thick and hard to apply for Jock Itch treatment. The process of applying the product and getting it to melt causes more itching. Not worth the price for me."
2678,3,"I was suspicious on how natural balm would work on Athletes foot. It doesn't work on Athlete's foot at least for me.It feels like a sugar scrub and has oil in it. So it will help with dried skin but that's about it!I think I will just go with regular method instead of trying to stay Natural. After all, it's just a skin."
2679,3,Sadly this didn't work for me. It actually made it worse causing itching to spread down my legs from my balls. It's also greasy and hard to get off your hands and smells awful. It took days to get it off. I went and bought gloves and applied it that way and tried it for 3 days but... I was really hoping it would work.
2680,3,Purchased this for a small patch of athlete's foot. Made the condition worse. Ended up returning the item for a refund. 1% clotrimazole cream from an over-the-counter drug store seems to be doing the trick. Was hoping a more natural treatment would clear the problem but unfortunately I'll just stick to the cream for future use.
2681,1,"If I could give this product negative stars, I absolutely would. I have always used a more popular brand of Vitamin C Serum but decided to give this one a try. Not only did this cause the most terrible, terrible break outs I have experienced in well over 2 years, it made my skin incredibly irritable as a result of SD Alcohol 40b (an ingredient) used as a solvent. I used this product every day, before moisturizer, after washing my face and using toner. I stopped using the product for 3 days and suddenly have not had a single pimple on my face. Beyond how terrible of the product is INSIDE the bottle, my bottle stopped sealing properly and would pour all over the inside or whatever I was transporting it in as I traveled. Please, please, do not purchase this product. Run the opposite direction."
2682,3,I bought this product in November and I’ve been closely monitoring my skin...with all the good review I’ve read about Vitamin C serum ...this actually made my skin worse ... I want from “ okay skin “ trying to improve it ...to “ bad “ skin after using it . Now I’m struggling to get rid of how ugly my skin looks now .
2683,3,"This is my first time using a vitamin C serum and I've been reading a bit about them. Most websites say it should be clear in color but this one is cloudy. Despite that I still tired the serum on my skin hoping that it would still be effective. Immediately after application my skin felt irritated and extremely dry. It's a real shame because I wanted this to work so much. I'm wishing I really listened to the other reviews before I bought this. I do believe that the serums they're selling are already oxidized. So basically this serum is ineffective. I'm really disappointed in this, it has just been a waste of money and time."
2684,3,"I’m so disappointed! I was really looking forward to this serum after reading such wonderful reviews. Unfortunately, I didn’t get to use this very long. It was a REALLY milky white color, I don’t know if this is common for this product, but I’ve been using vitamin c serum on my skin for years, and I’ve never, ever had one that’s basically white. Smelled funky. I did try it for a couple of weeks. It didn’t sink into my skin AT ALL. Very odd feeling on the skin as it really didn’t “rub in” well either. Not greasy, or oily, just kind of sits there in the skin and never dries. Strange. I’m wondering if I possibly got expired product, because something was just off about it. Especially with the volume of good reviews, unless they’ve been incentivized into giving them."
2685,3,"At first this worked amazingly well, I noticed results from the first application. However, after only a couple weeks of using this, my pores became really enlarged and my skin texture became bumpy - I don't know what it is but there's something in this that seems to clog my skin. It's a shame because the amount of Vitamin C in this really seemed to do a good job smoothing out and brightening my skin. Sigh. Back to the drawing board..."
2686,1,"While I can’t truly review if this product worked, I can say it made me so uncomfortably itchy that I couldn’t continue using it. Even after washing it off I would still feel terribly itchy! I used it once a day for about 5 days before the itchiness began. Not sure what changed but it’s not worth what it may do to eliminate my scars if I am adding me scratch marks to the area. It’s possible I’m allergic, but I tried Benadryl and cortisone cream and neither helped the situation. Two days past using it and still am itchy. Beware of this side effect."
2687,1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! This is the worst purchase I've ever made. I love shopping on Amazon because it is fast and convenient but this purchase has been the worst! I received this worn-out product that was unsealed and the expiration date noted was just 6 months from when I purchased it. There are some strange labels on the product box and it just looks so old, broken, and worn-out, that I feel so insecure to use it on my face and body. DON'T BUY THIS!"
2688,3,"I used this religiously and did not see a difference on my stretch marks. This is post baby #2 - I have stretch marks on my stomach and upper thighs. Perhaps it's because I am dark or maybe I should've bought another tube or maybe 100 more tubes. Either way, for the price, I would have liked to have seen something, nothing drastic but a little fading at least."
2689,3,"I bought 4 tubes of 50 grams, I was using them all for 3 months on my scar I saw there is no improve or change. There logo is save your money but I lost time and money. They wrote in their website if your are not satisfied you can get a refund. I tried to get a refund from them because I am not happy with the result but they told you are not US citizen. That's right!!"
2690,3,"USE ON A TEST AREA BEFORE APPLYING!I have never been allergic to any topical creams or gels. I have been using the Mederma SPF 30 cream with no issues, but thought I would try the Advanced. I broke out in hives all over every place this gel touched me. I am not sure what the difference is in this product to their others, but after doing research it is VERY common to have allergic reactions to this product. It may work for some, but PLEASE test it in a small area first.I unfortunately used it on my head - touched my face and arm... then when washing off because of the itch/burning/red swelling it ran down my ear neck and so on leaving a rash everywhere."
2691,2,"Burt's Bees Night Cream for Sensitive Skin- I have used this product FOREVER! I loved how it use to be thick and went on my skin. Now, it is so watered down that it actually dries my skin even more. I am giving it one star because the bottle that it comes in is very cute. Other than that, I am no longer buying this product."
2692,2,"I really wanted to love this moisturizer. I love most Burts Beez products. I ordered the night cream based on reviews but hated it the first time I used it. I figured it would give it a week before I stop. It doesn't do much for me. My skin feels ""wet"", it's too watery for me, if that makes sense. I felt like I still needed to moisturize after I used it. After a week i stopped using it and went back to my regular moisturizer."
2693,3,"I am just about certain that I received a ""knock off"" of this product. As you can see by the images, the product on the right is the true Burts Bees. I have been in the skin care industry for over 20 years. The real tell tail sign was that the actual product was not close in texture or smell to the real product."
2694,3,"I have used Burt's Bees products for several years because they are the only product I have found that I like and it does not cause my eyes to burn. This most recent purchase was not the quality of other products I have ordered. It was very runny and thin, not what you would expect from a night cream."
2695,2,"I have very dry, sensitive skin with roseaca and usually use Simple products with no problem but decided to try this out. It did not work at all. My face is still covered with foundation and blush after washing. I have to use up to four cotton balls with toner to clean my face. I usually only use toner if I feel my face is dirty with the Simple products. Not only does this not clean, but my roseaca is worse and my face is broken out and red. I am going back to my usual brand. This, unfortunately, does not do the job."
2696,1,Usage of this product dud worse than nothing for my skin. I tested it by comoaring 2 concurrent blemishes. A week later the pimple treated with Mighty Patch is regenflamed and huge. The non treated pimple has disappeared.I even reached out to the manufacturer about the kind of pimple this is supposed to work for. They were 100% unhelpful and useless. Don't waste your money on this.
2697,3,"I received a fake item. The box had typos and looked different from previous genuine versions I had purchased from brick and mortar stores. I noticed the issue when opening and noticing the product was thin, felt like tape instead of silicone!! When I looked closer at the box I saw the typos and realized it is a fake!! I can’t believe this!"
2698,3,"I was excited to try this, but it didn't work for me. It didn't suck out my pimples even though they were at the right stage for it. Instead, it just closed the top skin off and left my pimples ""stuck"" (if you know what I mean). I had to poke a hole on a couple of them so they'd get sucked out, and it did after I did so. But then it left my pimples hard and when they were finally gone, they left their dark spots on my face. Permanently. So disappointed."
2699,3,"So I tend to break out a lot due to stress, and with a business trip coming up, I wanted to have a solution for those inevitable ""are you kidding me, I have three meetings today"" zits. Everyone is so spun up about these that they seemed like a no-brainer.Unfortunately, I don't find they do much for me at all. Even if I follow the instructions exactly, and focus on zits that have come to a head, when I wake up in the morning, there's no significant difference. Sure, there's gross stuff in the little patch, but I'm honestly a little dubious as to whether it's ""sucking"" anything out or just having a chemical reaction since the zits themselves don't really appear to be reduced much. Even after using them over multiple days, I don't think the patch is doing anything for me that the passage of time is not. I've tried them on small white heads, and the larger, deeper, more painful ones with the same results.To top it all off, after using one on a zit above my upper lip (ugh), it made my skin flaky and dry and peeling. Hard pass, waste of money."
2700,1,this product will make your breakouts worse! I used this product as listed and my face proceeded to breakout even more and develop a rash around the area in which the dot were located. I now have locations on my face that look extremely dry and even more broken out. Very disappointed by product because I had very high hopes based on the reviews and since I only have occasional breakouts I thought it would really help but it made the situation sooooo much worse. to some it up! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
2701,2,"I was excited about this product, in fact, based on all the reviews i purchased the vitamin c serum, the lotion, and the retinol a. The Retinol a just dried the heck out if my skin. For days I was peeling around my mouth and i couldn't get it to stop. I don't have temperamental skin, so it's not my skin that was reacting funny, it was definitely the product that was aggravating my skin. I used it religiously since i purchased them (minus the retinol a cream only used that about once a week and avoided my mouth area) and i have not seen even one of the benefits the product claims or the other users say they see. Off to shop for another face cream/vitamin c serum. Bummer."
2702,3,"For some reason, this slightly burns the living heck out of my skin. There's some other stuff in here, nothing that isn't found in my other skincare products, but I didn't realize that until I read the ingredients when it arrived. That's my fault. The consistency is like cheap lotion but it absorbs well and dries fast. I have used it day and night for only 2 days, but for whatever reason, I'm breaking out in my cheeks already. Glad I'm catching this early."
2703,3,"I took a risk with this product due to it not arriving sealed. I used it daily for around 7 or 8 days and then it dried out in the bottle... i tried mixing it with hot water trying to revive it. I kept thinking it reminded me of something and one day before it jellied up, about a week of owning it, it got into my mouth through being on the corner of my mouth while rubbing it on my face- not trying to gross anyone out but it smells, feels, looks, jellies up and TASTES like semen! Im freaked out, I think I may take it to my doctor and see if he will be kind enough to have it lab tested for me... I am worried!"
2704,3,"Before I bought this product I did a lot of research on the reviews. I was a little hesitant in buying it because I don't like applying different things on my face because I feel i will mess it up. The first time I apply it I felt a tingling sensation but started noticing my face was getting red and swollen too. I read that the formula may have been alter on some reviews, I will try to use it one more time and hopefully I don't get the same reaction."
2705,2,I've purchased this a couple other times and used it without any issues which is why I made another purchase. This time there is a gritty feel to the serum. Shaking the bottle doesn't seem to mix the serum and rid it of the grittiness. I use it in the morning under my moisturizer but feel like I have to wipe my face before applying moisturizer which is growing old. Don't like wasting my money and I may have to look for a different brand to purchase next time. Disappointed.
2706,2,"If I could give this a negative 5 stars I would. I used the mask (mixed with ACV) 3 times and it made me break out with cystic acne almost immediately. 2 weeks later and I’m still dealing with the fallout. I have sensitive but usually clear skin, I mostly break out a tiny bit around my period. I’ve never had anything close to this level of acne in my life. I’m 30 and I haven’t had a cystic pimple until now. I actually switched from my normal natural skin care routine back to Proactiv to help get my skin back under control. If you are going to try this mask make sure you spot treat a small section of your face at first just to see how it reacts. This will be put on a no fly list for me. Never again."
2707,3,"brought a small container of this through TSA because I knew friends who had gotten it through no problem. it got pulled from my bag (not super surprising) but then it triggered an alarm on the chemical swab test. I don't know what is really in this but its not just clay if its setting off chemical alarms, and whatever it is I do not want it on my face.They had to bring the bomb squad guy in to do more intense tests on it. SKETCHY."
2708,3,"I have extremely sensitive skin. At 27 years old I still go through many breakouts and rely on my monthly facials to keep my skin under control. I heard so many good things about this product, did my research, checked reviews and I was pumped! But sadly for me, it made my forehead erupt in white heads. I was hoping maybe it was just because of a new toner I was using, so I tried it one more time. And no, not the toner, definitely the mask. I used organic apple cider vinegar, which I’ve used deluded with water as a toner a few months back, so I knew that wasn’t the problem. I thought about trying it with water, but I don’t want to go through that breakout a third time."
2709,1,"I've been using bentonite clay as a pore cleanser for a long time. I used to get a coarser version of this (this is very fine powder) that was both exfoliative and deep-cleansing; I liked that a lot better. I don't have very sensitive skin, so I left the mask on for 15 minutes, per the instructions. Boy, was that a mistake. My face was beet-red and you could see a distinct line around my face where the clay had been applied. It took hours to go away. As others have suggested, do a patch test on yourself before slapping this on your face.Buyer beware: biggest bummer besides a tomato face and a lack of a usable product = this seller does not accept returns."
2710,2,"I followed the instructions exactly and it burned my skin. I started feeling a burning sensation but thought that was just the ""pulsating"" that I was supposed to feel. But when I rinsed it off my skin was really red. Again, after reading the directions and reviews I expected this. But the next day it still felt tender. A couple days later I noticed dark patches of thick skin forming. I looked like I had been sunburned and the new skin was coming in. When my skin finally healed it looked exactly the same as before, acne and all. I don't want to try doing it again and risk really damaging my face."
2711,2,"When I started to apply the mask for the first time, before I could even finish covering my face, it started to burn. Badly. At first it was a little tingle but then it started to feel as if someone was holding a lighter too close to my face. I immediately washed it off and my skin has mostly calmed down, my cheeks still pinch a tiny bit. I'll see if I have any visible irritation and continuing pinching sensation in the morning (God forbid).UPDATE: It's morning and my face is fine, no irritation marks or pinching. I really wanted this work but I guess not :/ I'll just stick to face sheets instead."
2712,1,"I never type reviews but this mask had me in tears. It broke my face out so horribly. Big and painful, deep cystic zits. I know they say that masks like these are suppose to ""purge your skin,"" but I feel as though this caused problems that were not there. I typically have combination to sensitive skin, with the occasional breakout every time of the month. I normally use the Origins mud mask, but wanted to try something new. This was just not for me, so beware!"
2713,3,"My skin is finicky and sensitive. I got this for pores and blackheads. It did NOTHING for my blackheads or pores. What it did do was break out my skin very badly giving my cystic like acne- which I have never had before. Everyone has different skin, this product was a huge fail for me, I was so disappointed."
2714,1,"I have tried many masks and scrubs over the years and was hoping this one would be good. I was mistaken. I really didn't notice anything from it. I think I may have broken out more after using it a few times and it dried my skin out really bad. I would not recommend this to anyone or even share it with a friend who come over.Be careful before you buy unknown brands because they send free items to people for good amazon reviews. I learned the hard way several times on that.I've tried this mask and it didn't help my skin at all. I have oily skin with adult on-set acne, some cystic. I use salicylic acid wash and benzoyl peroxide spot treatment. I'm going with something else. Good luck.."
2715,3,i read SO MANY good reviews on this mask & i have no idea what anyone is talking about. this mask has done NOTHING to improve my skin or make my skin look better. my face isn’t “so smooth” after using. it def isn’t a “pore minimizer“ i feel like the masks from dollar general work way better. i honestly can’t even say one thing good about this mask. does nothing for my combination skin or pores. not even slightly. total bummer.
2716,3,"I received my roller today and unfortunately what I received was not the Sdara brand. I am going to return the ""knock-off"" version and purchase directly from the Sdara website. The Sdara brand has such good reviews so I'm sure I wont be disappointed."
2717,3,"This thing felt pretty good the first time I used it. Then right after my skin was hot and red for hours. Thought I would give it another shot, and with every use it would get worse. I waited a week in between each use. Maybe my skin is just too sensitive for this one?"
2718,3,I ordered this one as most of the reviews were glowing. However when I used it last night a few hours after it was delivered it didn’t do anything but squeak as I rolled it across my face. Did not work as promised at all. Very disappointed in this purchase. I’d leave zero stars if it were an option.
2719,3,"Followed instructions, disinfected it, did everything right. Began breaking out horribly the day after using it and got worse and worse for two weeks. Worse than a waste of money, as it made my skin actually worse."
2720,3,I purchased this believing it would give me the effect that I received in a session with the plastic surgeon. It is an inexpensive facial item that lives up to the old saying “you get what you pay for”. The company read this review and credited back my card for a refund!
2721,3,"This used to be the only facewash i could use and that would not cause my face to break out, but now it leaves my face not only dry, but it causes it to peel and breakout. Furthermore, this even causes my hands to peel. I’ve bought bottles from both the store and amazon, and the issues are consistent. I believe they’ve changed the ingredients used, and it’s causing an adverse chemical reaction for my skin."
2722,3,"I have been using this face wash forever and for the first time from Amazon. This product, although the same packaging, is not the same actual product. THis is much more watery than the same product sold at Rite Aid or Walgreens. The exfoliant beads are also more coarse than that of the product previously purchased. I don't know if this is bootlegged material, a bad batch or what, but I am highly disappointed."
2723,2,"Sigh...Why have you betrayed me Aveeno?! I have used the Aveeno moisturizer for years now and it's amazing. I thought I would try their other acne products and I was deeply disappointed. This sucked. It was an instant irritant and caused me to break out everywhere. And I'm not taking, ""Oh, your skins just adjusting to it,"" for an excuse. Never had an acne product make me break out so badly and I am NEVER buying Aveeno again. I stick with my African black soap and call it a day."
2724,1,"I have never had a problem with aveeno products, but WOW did this leave my face burning, itching and dry. I was flaking and irritated immediately after use and onto the next day.If you have sensitive skin, don’t use this. It broke me out when I’ve not broken out in months. My skin truly hates this product. STAY AWAY!!"
2725,3,I bought this because I use Aveeno daily body wash and trusted the brand. This is supposed to be a gentle daily scrub but after the very first use it left my face burning. The next morning I woke up to find that I had a huge red rash on my face. I don't know if it was an allergic reaction to something in it or if it was just too harsh for my skin but it was awful. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is because I have sensitive skin and others may not have the same reaction. Plus it does smell very nice.
2726,3,"I do not have sensitive skin and I have never had acne. After the first use I immediately broke out. I didn't want to blame it on this toner right away hoping that the acne was caused by something else. However, after trying it a week later the same thing occurred. I've even tried putting it on just one area (my forehead) and the next morning I woke up with pimples just on my forehead. Not only does this leave your average pimples on my skin, but they also gave me painful cystic acne thy has left scars on my face. I've stopped using it altogether and my skin is back to its normal, clear self. Very disappointed."
2727,1,"My dad and I share this account. I'm a young adult in college if you were curious.First off: My review is specific to my skin. Just because it did not work for me does not mean it will not work for you.Secondly: My skin is oily-combo, acne prone, sensitive (and I mean sensitive af) skin. This typing could be why it did not work for me.I was really excited to use this product, but unfortunately it ended up making me break out. Why? I don't know. My skin breaks out from many many things. If you have a skintype that is sensitive, this may not be for you. Save your money. Otherwise, based on the other reviews, try it for yourself."
2728,3,"I was really excited to try this because of all the great reviews. Im a teenager with sensitive and acne prone skin, I also have slight rosacea. The problem with this toner is that it irritated my skin. It increased the amount of small bumps and redness that my rocasea already causes. So it wasn't for me. I did like the smell."
2729,3,"I was really excited about this product, and began using it with a few other new skin products. I have clear, semi dry skin. I realized I was getting hive like areas- especially under my eyes and along my jaw. After eliminating these products one by one I realized it’s this all natural product! The last time I used it the hives were EVERYWHERE I used it on my face and hurt really bad. Super bummed. Wish it worked well for me."
2730,3,"I have no idea what is going on! Top photo was before I used this product, the bottom is a week from then. I got this in hopes that it would get rid of my red acne marks but it just made me break out even more! I've been doing everything the same. It's been a week of using this and my face hurts! It feels like I got a sunburn. I'm going to keep using it to see if it gets worse before it gets better. But I'll update if it gets any better."
2731,3,"The seatbelt in the picture is sewn in the backing of the chair. The chair I received, the seatbelt was sewn into the bottom back area of the seat. When I put my son in the seat he almost fell out from the side when he went to reach for something. I love the chair but I'm sending it back. I'm not sure if I got a defective chair. If someone from Summer Infant could contact me that would be great."
2732,1,"I had high hopes for this after reading all the reviews. I was pretty disappointment when the chair arrived. First off, it shipped in it’s orignal packaging and by the time USPS delivered it, it just fell out of the torn box when picked up. The tray is extremely hard to put on/off. It doesn’t unfold easily and the straps are swen into the chair so low they do nothing to hold your child in. The straps are swen into the bottom seam and not the middle of the chair like the picture shows. This chair just had too many strikes against it so I returned it and bought the Hiccapop version and absolutely love it. Save your time and money and go ahead and order the Hiccapop to begin with."
2733,3,"I purchased this booster seat for my grandchild. I received the item Monday and opened the box to use the seat this evening. The chair was in the over the shoulder bag but when I pulled the tray out to begin to set the chair up, I noticed the dried food on the top of the tray. As I looked closer I could see dried baby food on the legs of the chair, the underside of the tray and baby food stains on the fabric of the chair itself. As we began to unfold the chair, actually pieces of food were inside of the chair. I am promptly returning this item for a full refund."
2734,3,I did not like this chair. The overall concept is great and the reason I bought it in the first place. The picture is incorrect on where the strap is placed. The strap is actually on the bottom so it is not easily used to allow to strap the child in for safety. I was so disappointed that it was not as it shows in the pictures. Other reviews state the same thing. Sometimes I just get excited and don't always read the reviews and wish I had. I returned it after I noticed.
2735,3,"This is a terrible product. Do not let the postive reviews fool you. Everyone mentions the seatbelt issue but that is the least probmatic issue with this product. The biggets issue I have with the product is that there is no locking mechanism to keep it down. Meaning my son while sitting in it was pulling up on it and essentially closing himself up into the seat. The tray is also impossible to get on. If you can't line it up perfectly there is no way it is going on there, and since there is no locking mechanism to keep the chair down it is nearly impossible to line it up. And impossible to do it with a child sitting in the chair. I never could figure out how to get the tray on before giving up and hitting the return button. I really wanted this to work because it sound perfect in theory and maybe if there is another brand who attempts this I would try it, but this brand did a terrible job at excuiting their design and they clearly don't care since they have done nothing to fix the issues that have been complained about."
2736,3,"I was very disappointed and dissatisfied with the quality, especially since this item was highly rated and even mentioned in the baby bargains book. I washed them according to the instructions before putting them on the crib, and this is what one of them looked like. If this is what they look like after 1 washing, what would they look like after a few months? Returned to Amazon for a full refund."
2737,2,"This put off such a strong smell even after washing it twice. I let it sit out for a few weeks to see if the smell would go away and it did not. I decided I would give it a try and see if a fitted sheet over the pad would mask the smell. After my baby took a nap in the crib with this pad, he smelt so strongly of this “chemical” smell. I quickly bathed him and will not be giving this pad another try!"
2738,3,"I bought this in 2016 for $14 for a crib mattress i bought for my dog. Hes a 90 pound German Shepard. I wanted this for protection against accidents. Which he never had any, but now i have a Newfoundland puppy and she got sick on it and it soaked right though! It wasn't a lot luckily but what she did throw up went right to the mattress. It also makes a crinkling sound when you move around on it so you can tell its a cheap one. But it should not say waterproof if it is not."
2739,1,"Unfortunately I waited too long to wash these and my return window has closed. I ordered this in the end of November because we are expecting baby #3 in April and needed some extra crib mattress covers. Just washed them for the first time to get ready for baby and they have not even been used but the ""quilted"" part is basically coming apart like a cotton ball from both sides of the mattress pad. I am SO EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND FRUSTRATED that it is doing this because little bits of the cotton material stuck all over other pieces of laundry and I don't even feel like I will get any use of these. I also don't ever want to wash them with anything else, not even crib sheets because I don't want to have to pick cotton pieces off every inch again! I'm so annoyed that I waited to wash them until closer to baby time. I feel I deserve to be able to return them and get a replacement of different quality! I've bought American Baby Company products before and never had a problem so I don't know why this is such POOR QUALITY!!! DO NOT BUY THESE!!! You will be throwing your money away. I guess you get what you pay for as these were fairly inexpensive."
2740,3,I put this on my babys bed just before her nap today and she peed straight through right into the BRAND NEW mattress. Everyone else is talking about how awesome it is and Pee literally went straight through it. Now I have a brand new ruined mattress.I'm pretty upset about it actually. I guess the only thing this mattress protects is droplets because it sure didn't do anything else.
2741,3,"Extremely dissapointed, and my wife is returning the one we purchased. If you want to do anything like upgrade, set defaults, or really do anything custom that it requires the app. The app requires your location be on and the app allowed to use your gps location, this is any time the app is launched. They also don't mention unless you go looking, that per their privacy policy they are collecting a bunch of information on you, and your child and it's habits. Such as feeding times, etc.From their site:""While using our Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain information that can be used to contact or identify you.

When using our products and services, we will also collect information including, but not limited to, child’s weight, child’s feeding amount, child’s sleep, etc."""
2742,3,"We used the tot clock for my son and loved it, but liked the idea of controlling the clock from our phone so we tried this one for our daughter. Big mistake. It's a pain to set up as the app is really messy and not well made. It's also impossible to start a nap timer/countdown at any time other than the exact time you program it for, without waking the child up once the countdown finishes. And as for the phone control (the reason we even bought it in the first place!!!), its spotty at best. It takes forever to connect, randomly disconnects, has a bad distance range, and if we had needed a second one for our other child apparently people have had huge difficulty switching between the two devices."
2743,3,"We tried using this for our near 4-month old. We love the concept. Until we learned the controls are on the bottom, unlit. Which means finding the phone at 3 am to adjust the settings, or fiddling in the dark on the device. 2nd red flag..not nearly as loud as needed for baby white noise, and the sound quality is subpar. Finally, we have a fussy tired baby and we're trying to adjust the sound machine, and it's not adjusting, neither from our phone or from the manual controls. It's stuck. And meanwhile still baby crying. Unplugged, replugged and tried to restart the device. Doesn't turn on. Baby still crying. Done. Return."
2744,3,"Loved the idea of this, but in reality it's terrible! The light has a bar to toggle how bright/dim the light is and there's no substantial difference between the brightest and dimmest settings. The brightest setting is only just bright enough to walk around the room. Contrarily the sound range is all way too loud and I need it on the lowest possible to hear myself think. There is no way someone could sleep through that. There are 11 sound options and they are all terrible. It only works about half the time. I am constantly restarting the app. It comes unplugged at the slightest touch and there is no battery power option. For some this thing is probably great but it just doesn't do it for our family; it's TOO fancy and unreliable. Will be returning."
2745,3,"As a millennial mom of 2, I thought this would be great. Because the plug doesn't really work this thing gets unplugged to the lightest touch and doesn't have a battery option, so basically only turns on half the time. It is the most frustrating nightlight/noise machine to use at bedtime and nap time. Also, so difficult to manually adjust this when you are in a dark room, because you flip the thing over to adjust the volume (if you are not by your phone), and then it comes unplugged, noise and light won't turn on. If you have a toddler who likes to touch things, forget it-- device will come unplugged again and again. Not worth the very expensive price tag."
2746,3,"I’m pretty upset I’m even having to write this but after having the car seats ( 3 of them) for 3 months, I’m having some problems. This applies to all three! First issue is the car seat isn’t easy to get the belt in or out through the loop the belt gets twisted and or locks up because of it. The fabric on the top and bottom of the seat is constantly coming off! I hate this! I had a cheap car seat that did the same thing, that’s why I wanted something more expensive this time. The seats are freaking hard to clean! You can’t just throw them in the washer like other car seats you really have to scrub them by hand . Not such a big problem but when your paying this amount of money I expected more . My car seats feel flimsy and just not worth the money. I have contacted evenflo and no one has gotten back to me days later .Pretty upset I should of bought a different more durable seat."
2747,1,"This booster seat looks cool, and will keep your child safe. The cup holders are so stiff, it is hard for me to open them. It's almost impossible for my son to open them, which makes him very frustrated. It is extremely difficult to get the seatbelt into the belt loop on the seat. Trying to remove the seatbelt from the loop, is even harder. Trying to buckle the seatbelt is a task as well. My wife has to walk around to the other side of the car in order to get the seat belt buckled. This seat is very time consuming to use, and is a major hassle. I don't recommend purchasing this booster seat."
2748,2,"RETURNED. I really wanted to like this seat. Too lightweight and flimsy! It does NOT anchor to the seat, so when my son is not sitting in it, the seat falls over when I take a turn in the car. The seatbelt also gets stuck sliding through the plastic feeder thing, making it really hard for my 7 year old to buckle himself. I drive a Subaru Outback, and this did not work well AT ALL for us. Sent this one back and purchased a Chicco KidFit, which we love!!"
2749,2,"I spent many hours researching for a great best bet high-back booster by the NHSTA, as safety is VERY important to me that also looked great, which is important to my daughter. I concluded that the Evenflo Spectrum would be perfect, as the Maestro has been a great no-frills harnessed booster for my younger son. My daughter could not WAIT to receive it! It arrived today, & it was simple to assemble. The fabric was very smooth & pretty, & the seat is very well padded. However, I didn't heed others warnings. There were multiple problems with the design:1) The high-back portion is beyond flimsy! My 46 lb daughter sat down, & the entire back portion leaned! The seat was flush against the captain's chair. We took it out, inspected that it was all together correctly, & realized the plastic is so flimsy you can easily twist it. It likely works great as a backless booster, but $60 for a backless would be steep & defeat what it was bought for.2) The belt guide is hard to thread & is very narrow. Once I finally got it in there, it indeed did not retract after buckling due to the fabric overlay. If a parent did not pay attention to this when their child buckled in & got in an accident, there would be too much slack & the child would likely be ejected. Even if they weren't, there would be severe injuries from the belt not being able to do its job, which is lock under tension. This seat, that's supposed to save your child's life, could actually cost it if you weren't diligent.3) A mild nuisance is the cup holders/snack trays. They are very difficult to get open & impossible for a smaller child. They are thin plastic, not very deep, & not a functional size/shape.I boxed it right back up but had a very upset child! So, we went looking for a SAFE pink replacement with good cupholders. We looked at other Evenflo products: the Big Kid Amp, & were even more disappointed by the poor construction. Tried the Chase, but it is not adjustable as a high-back booster. They have lost a customer!For $40 more, we got a Graco Wayz & couldn't be happier! It has rigid body, an extended height/weight harness mode, can be hard-latched in booster mode to 100# (the Spectrum did not even have a ""soft latch""), is a beautiful color, & a breeze to install. The padding was only slightly less than the Spectrum but unnoticeable to my daughter. She feels much safer in this one, & I feel grateful to have found a reasonably-priced seat that offers me piece of mind! Trust me when I say the extra $40 is nothing compared to my daughter's life! 4 kids (oldest is now 11), & this is the first car seat I've ever had to return..."
2750,3,"WAY BIGGER than the ad says. Just for everyone's information, 3 DO NOT fit accross the back seat in town and country stow and go minivan. We had 3 boosters that fit, but we replaced them with these. The ad said that these measured a whole inch NARROWER than our previous seats at their widest points. This is simply not the case. These are at least 3 inches WIDER and DO NOT fit not matter how much tugging and pushing is done. If you only have 1 or 2 kids, these are pretty nice. strong, easy to move, and secure. I am disappointed in the purchase because someone can't measure."
2751,2,"We have two of these in the bedroom with my 10 month old twins. We use them for every nap and all night. I liked that they plug in rather than use batteries. We always use them on the highest setting. However, yesterday our most recently purchased one (June '18) wouldn't turn on in the highest setting. The lowest setting still works, but that's too quiet to drown out street noise and the noise of each sibling. Night wakes were awful last night! I'm reluctant to buy another because I'm afraid of the same thing inexplicably happening again. We will need something else though, so the research process is starting all over again for me."
2752,3,"This 2018 version (Model M1DSUSTN) is not the same as the 2013 version (Model DOHM DS). The case designs are slightly different.2013: 4 screws on bottom, gray foam rubber on bottom, case shell surrounding switch tapers vertically, acrylic curved Dohm branded cap top center.2018: 2 screws on bottom with molded internal clips, 4 clear hard rubber feet on bottom, case shell surrounding switch straight up & down vertically, Dohm branded silver colored sticker top center.The main difference, and the reason I'm returning this 2018 model, is the sound. The 2018 has a slight rattle and clicking noise which I cannot sleep to. An inferior motor? An artifact of the different case design? I don't know.Measuring temperature at the bottom with a laser infrared thermometer, after running a few hours, with airflow dials constrained fully clockwise, the 2013 model measured 96.5°F; the 2018 model 110.6°F. Higher temperature could be due to absence of foam rubber on the bottom or higher internal resistance and/or friction in the fan motor."
2753,3,Concerned. I bought this last January after loving the one I got for my daughters room . I had no issues with the first one I got at babiesrus but this one if left on for a few hours has this strong plastic burning smell. I haven’t used this one very much since buying but now as summers ending I wanted to use it more. I thought at first the smell was because it was new but now months later I’m definitely convinced there is something wrong with it. I would like to get in touch with the manufacturer but since I have purchased with amazon I’m am hoping to get some help in the right direction here. I also have another baby due in December and really don’t want to have to buy another sound maker. I’m willing to ship out the one I have so someone can look at it .
2754,1,"I have had one of these for years that I still use in my 4yo’s room and it works great. We purchased a second one when we were expecting our second child and that one has been tempermental since we started using it about 5 months ago. At first it would take a couple seconds to turn on, which I honestly did not think much of but that got worse. Now it starts fine 80% of the time but takes up to 15 minutes to start whirring a couple nights a week. I could live with that; just a mild nuisance. What really has me upset is the inconsistent sound the unit is producing after a few months of use. Instead of a steady white noise, it sounds as though the rotating parts inside are not spinning smoothly and it makes emits a loud chirping sound. It is very disruptive rather than relaxing which renders it basically unusable.I have also seen other reviewers mentioning the difference in the low mode volume in newer versus older versions. I can corroborate those claims, but we only ever use the high setting.I am very disappointed with my second go-around with the dohm. I will have to find an alter alternative and I have stopped recommending this to friends."
2755,1,"I loved the noise maker itself. It is small and worked well for awhile. A few days ago, my daughter woke up crying and the machine was extremely hot to touch and was making a very high pitched, loud knocking noise. I tried to contact the company to notify them of this very concerning issue and Amazon instructed me to leave this review. I’m hoping others will see this and take caution."
2756,1,"These changing pad liners are awful. I got them to put on top of the regular changing pad in my baby's nursery, so that I wouldn't have to wash the whole changing pad cover if he peed or pooped mid-diaper-change. The backing to this doesn't grip the changing pad cover at all, so you end up with a really flimsy piece of cloth that slides around if your baby moves. The flannel changing pad liners with the waterproof inside that they sell at Babies R Us are WAY better, even if they are smaller. I would not recommend these things at all."
2757,3,"Not a fan. I purchased two packs of these because I liked the price point. However, they were okay when my little guy was brand new, but now at 2 months old they just move around and bunch up under him as he wiggles around during diaper changes. I also wash my baby items (especially diapering related ones) on hot to kill any bacteria, and the plastic backing on some of these melted and has little holes in it, thus defeating the waterproof purpose. I tried to save a few dollars and ended up with an inferior product. I should have just repurchased the better ""oversized"" liners from another brand that I had originally bought."
2758,1,"Those pads are too small even for 1 mo child. Too tiny and absolutely not covering enough space. In addition, it is so small and light that it always gets displaced while changing diapers.So while I was hoping that those pads would prevent the mess they actually added the mess giving a false sense of safety.Don't understand WHY the maker won't make those pads at least twice bigger.Don't waste your money and prevent the waste of your furniture!"
2759,1,"I had purchased a different brand prior to these that have been a life-saver when changing my little one. I honestly thought that all brands would be the same and work the same. These were awful. Not only did they not really do the job of helping accidents not seep unto the diaper changing table , when I would wash these liners, they all turned a dull grey and had weird stain marks. I DO not recommend purchasing these liners, they also constantly slip around while changing my little one."
2760,1,"Why are these so popular they are junk!!Purchased them in September a week after baby was born. I liked the size at first, she was tiny and it was nice to still see the cute changing pad cover. As she grew and I washed these they feel apart quickly and just became frustrating as she wiggles they balled up beneath her and were useless.Other customer photos of the backing are exactly what happened to mine. I threw them out this weekend.Save your money! Look for something else."
2761,3,"I purchased these utensils when my daughter was around 12 months old, and just starting to be interested in feeding herself with a spoon. The majority of spoons we had tried just had too long of handles, and she'd struggle to get them in her mouth. After seeing the reviews, I purchased these, but wish I would have skipped them all together. The size is just too small. My daughter is very petite for her age (still in 9 month old clothes), and the handle of the spoon was dinky in comparison to her hand. The length was also an issue. While I wanted them significantly smaller than a normal baby spoon, these were laughably short and nearly pointless. My daughter ended up throwing them and just using her hands, because they were useless to her. I'm sad I shelled out the money for these, and wish I would have been able to return them when I first figured out that they wouldn't work. Waste of money."
2762,3,"The spoon is okay....the fork is too small even for a toddler I feel.......the spoon is helping her learn to use a spoon and it's easy for her to hold, but these are just wayyyyyyy over priced.........There is no reason these should cost this much."
2763,2,"Love the idea of these little utensils, but wasn’t overly impressed with them in use. The handles are really small, so my son couldn’t really get the best grip. I like that they have the little choke guards, but they almost need to be a little further back on the utensil to be practical.Wouldn’t purchase again."
2764,3,Baby loved this spoon. Very easy to grasp and clean. Used it for three meals and then dropped it off the high chair and it shattered. I’ll order another one because he liked it so much but I’m bummed about how easily it broke.
2765,3,"For some reason my, my initial review has been removed. I ordered these for my then 14 month old son. Thought it was a great concept, but a bit pricey for one fork and one spoon, but ordered anyway to give it a try. When I opened the box I was surprised at how small these utensils were. I was excited to see how my son would like them. Unfortunately after ONE use the fork prongs were bent out of shape. Very disappointed. After I posted my review the company contacted me and wanted to make it right. They told me that the fork print shouldn’t bend. These utensils are meant for little ones and should last a long time. I emailed back and thanked them for their customer service, and I would appreciate a replacement fork. Well it has been over a month and I haven’t heard back from anyone, or received a replacement fork. To top it off my review was removed. I’m very disappointed."
2766,3,"So the product is a good idea but does not work. After following the instructions we installed the film on two windows, the first film came off within two hours of installation and second window started to peel off within 24 hours. Luckily they are cheap but I considered it a waste of my money."
2767,3,This must be the worst product on Amazon. I’m accustomed to doing these types of installation and I needed to used a whole roll for one window. Perhaps I got a bad lot I don’t know but I would encourage anyone to buy with caution. The plastic backing was difficult to remove- should’ve peeled off easily - once placed on the window air bubbles could not be removed and yes water was applied and a squeegee used. Of the past 48 hours air bubbles have continued to form and there’s only two options:1-is to remove the product 2-squeegee the window daily. Don’t know where some of these reviews came from.
2768,1,"I did a door redo and was so excited for this product. I wanted frosted glass, but since the door was antique I didn't want to ruin the glass. I ordered the film and followed the directions exactly. The film would stock for a few minutes but start to peel. I tried several times. Eventually I got the film to stick for a whole hour. I thought maybe I got a bad roll, so silly me, I ordered another roll. Sure enough, same thing happened. I ordered a different brand after that and it was night and day different. The new brand has been on for mo th with no peeling, no bubble. I will never recommend this brand to a friend. When I asked for a refund I got no response."
2769,3,"When I unrolled the film, I immediately saw a few bare spots where there was no frosting at all. As I unrolled the whole roll, the quality was terrible. It was inconsistent throughout the whole film. I wound up throwing this away and buying the Window Whirl product: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X3XDQQ4/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1, which was a much better product."
2770,3,"This window film is beautiful in the pictures but did not meet my expected level of quality when it came to installation. I am an interior designer and purchased the Coavas Window Film for my personal use. No matter how many times I tried - it is impossible to get rid of all the air bubbles. Unless there is some hack I don't know of, like using a hair blower or something, you will never get as clean and clear appearance as the photos indicate."
2771,1,"Buyers beware—I recently purchased this white noise maker based on the 'steller' reviews and the item being 'Amazon's choice' product. However, after I received it, it has flimsy power adapter, the number of white noises is super limited, and my baby disliked it. To my surprise, the item is NOT eligible for return—I don't know why. There's really no reason for me to keep an expensive white noise maker that doesn't work. I'm super disappointed and wish I was notified of the return policy before I checked out!"
2772,3,"Have to have a fan running in order to sleep, when winter rolls around it’s not ideal to run a fan. I was very skeptical about this working as I would need it to, it was better than I expected. You have so many choices of fans or white noise. I found a couple of fan sounds that work beautifully. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a fan running to help them sleep.UPDATE MARCH 15, 2019I purchased this December 12, 2018, I started using it the day I received it which was December 14, 2018. I use it everyday and it worked great until the middle of the night on March 13, 2019 it actually woke me up because it was popping in and out and then the volume would start at normal then go down really low then go back up just like someone was playing with the volume. It finally did run normally after about 30 minutes. Last night I turned it on and went to be and read for awhile, it was fine for 2 hours and then it started to do the exact same thing. That same static causing it to pop in and out then the volume started going up and down. I shut it off and broke out my old reliable box fan. Checked online this morning and my window of tech support ended March 14, 2019. How convenient! Going in the trash!!"
2773,1,I have an older model that I love and still works great after several years. We bought the new LectroFan model to replace a cheaper machine that quit working after 2 years. I wish I would have bought the cheaper machine-this one quit working after 2 months. The sound would slowly fade until it was completely off and you couldn’t hear anything at all. Turning it off and back on works for about 5 minutes and then it’s back to no sound. Very disappointed in this and I would not recommend buying it.
2774,3,"So weird--but i bought one of these in August, 2014, and it just stopped working in August, 2015. They then so kindly re-sent me a new one, and then it worked perfectly for a little over a year...but now in December, 2016, it stopped working again. I LOVE this when it works, but for the price point I feel it should work for more than a year.Just my thoughts...Thanks"
2775,1,"We bought this in August 2016 for two trips; one to Europe in Sept 2016 where it worked for 11 days. The next was for a trip to California for two weeks about six months later where it worked. Then, in September 2017 (it was by then one month one year old) it did not work on another trip. So, used twice, total of 20 days. Fiddled with it. How to fix? One year warranty. GOES TO LANDFILL. DISGRACEFUL."
2776,3,"I was originally not going to write a review because I figured I would cut my losses on this idiotic purchase I foolishly made. However, the company keeps messaging me asking me to review the product. So be it. This pillow sucks. I wish I hadn't believed all of the hype about this stupid pillow. I cannot believe I was fooled into paying $14.96 for this miniature, bootleg quality pillow. They say it is a Poly/Cotton blend but the only cotton thing about this pillow is the thread used to sew the hem.I knew it would be small, but it's much smaller than I imagined it would be. The quality of the pillowcase is horrible. It's rough and scratchy. The pillow is also rough and scratchy. I know the thread count has to be very low because the synthetic filling is coming through the fabric. I can't in good conscience let my daughter use this pillow knowing that there are tiny white fibers coming out of the pillow. The pillow is actually rather fluffy and is the only redeeming quality about it."
2777,3,Just received today.. I was really excited because my daughter pillow now is too tall. I opened the package and there is like this white powder all over my blue shirt. I really don't want to have to return it.. Wait for a refund.. Then have another delivered. I'll just pray it is safe on the delegate cycle in the washer. Not very pleased right now.
2778,3,"I’m actually very surprised that this has so many great reviews. I purchased this after reading and reading reviews on here and another comparable pillow and I definitely didn’t pick the right one. This pillow is so full. Think, adult pillow, just smaller. It’s so thick I can’t imagine it being safe for a child under 4. It’s about 5.5 inches thick in the middle and still a good 4 in the corners. I also measured the pillow I sleep with just for comparison and mine measures 6 in the middle, just to give you an idea. I tried reaching out to the company via email with no response, going to be sending it back and go with the one I should’ve picked to begin with."
2779,3,"This is the perfect pillow size & fluffiness for my 2 year old tummy-sleeper. It is well made & I love that it is made in the USA! Great customer service, too. I will definitely be a return customer in the future!Update: So, we have had this pillow for almost exactly 3 months now. Had to wash it today for the second time because, well, toddlers like to vomit in their beds occasionally. I washed it just like the directions indicated. It literally exploded in the washing machine. Fluff everywhere! Apparently the seams are not sewn very strong. Wow...."
2780,2,"This is the first pillow for my 17 month old. I was not planning to buy pillows for him that early but he won't go to sleep until lying on my pillow. I picked this one because of the good reviews and ""organic cotton""! Unfortunately, it disappointed both my baby and me. The pillow case doesn't feel like cotton at all. Sooo rough and scrathy, I tied for one nap and it's sooooo uncomfortable and made my face and ears itchy! The stuffing is like a five dollar polyester filling you can get from craft store. Poor package with broken plastic wrapper. I will not use it at all, not even mention for my baby..... Serious!"
2781,1,"While the directions on the stool says that it will lock into place, it doesn't. There is no lock. You can pick up this stool or bump into it with your foot and it can easily fold up on its own. I bought this for my 3 year old to use at the bathroom sink, but I am worried that it will fold if it shifts slightly when stepping on it and he could get seriously hurt. I do not recommend it for children. It would probably be okay for an adult to use on carpeted surfaces."
2782,3,"I bought this for my studio apartment, where I have several high shelves that I can't reach. I liked that it can fold and collapse so it can be easily stored somewhere, since I don't have much space in my small apartment. Unfortunately, it was TOO collapsable: The stool broke right out from under me maybe the third time I ever stood on it. I also was only standing on it for about a minute while I was putting something away. The plastic snapped and I fell, and the plastic is also super sharp if it shatters. Not worth the money!"
2783,1,"This seemed like a handy stool and we have two others by different brands that have held up well for several years. However, we ordered this about 5 months ago and this week my 2.5 year old girl hopped on it to brush her teeth and the plastic side split/broke in several spots and collapsed under her and hit her head. Definitely do not recommend anyone order this brand of these types of stools as they will break under minimal weight."
2784,1,"I had high hopes for this little stool. I used it to step up to my bed which is quite high. At first it wobbled slightly, but I thought that was because it isn't really sturdy since it folds up so the construction is basically wobbly. So I accepted that. Then last night I was getting off the bed and stepped on the stool and the plastic cracked and broke, not at the weak folding joints but right across the solid plastic piece. It threw me off into the dresser where I landed. I couldn't believe how badly it was broken and with such little force on it. I am an average sized woman, not overweight, a senior citizen and handicapped. I used this stool with only light use, putting little strain on it. I feel lucky I only fell into the dresser and not onto the ground where I couldn't get up. I owned this for 6 weeks when it broke, and I used it daily to get into and out of bed. I have returned it to Amazon. So beware, this stool was dangerous for me."
2785,1,NOT SAFE! My poor little girl got her fingers stuck while trying to move this stool! She literally picked it up with two purple fingers stuck in the sides! Worst feeling for me! Going straight to the trash and getting one that isn't collapsible to matter how safe they claim it to be.
2786,1,"Unfortunately this product was inoperable when it arrived. After a few days, I tried turning it on again and it worked, but only for about 3 days. When it worked, it was wonderful. In particular, I enjoyed the wave sounds. Volume was adjustable and could go from low to high with a good range. I was impressed with such a small portable size producing such a full range of sound. I was looking forward to being able to take it with me when I travel, but alas, that will not be the case.Amazon customer service was very accommodating when I attempted to return the product and issued me a full refund, although to my surprise they told me to just dispose of the item rather than send it back. This gives me the impression that I am one of many experiencing this issue. Upon further investigation, I discovered the reviews noting counterfeit products from China, and much to my shock and dismay, indeed, my product has China imprinted on the bottom with none of the markers characteristic of the Marpac products (initialed and dated with USA declaration). I ordered the larger Dohm sound machine directly from Marpac and confirmed that there is indeed a USA marker, accompanied by initials and dating by quality assurance. I have had no issues with the Brand name product since purchase and will most likely re-purchase the portable version again through them in the future. I sincerely encourage Amazon to stop selling these counterfeit products as it discourages me from trusting that any of their products are legitimate."
2787,3,"I really liked the idea of this sound machine. I use sound machines for sleeping and when I study so I purchased this one for travel. I have had it for a couple of days and I have started to notice this really weird high pitch melody coming from the machine. It happens every couple of seconds. I kept turning the machine on and off to make sure it wasn't something else. Definitely the sound machine. Once you hear it, you can't un-hear and it is very distracting. Sadly, this will be returned."
2788,3,"I decided to try this when I saw it on sale and I’m glad I didn’t pay full price. We have and love three of the original Marpac Dohm machines in all bedrooms as well as a travel Rohm.This machine doesn’t compare. The sounds are all very synthetic/electronic sounding. The white noise buttons sound nothing like the Dohm. The others are awful compared to the options on the (much cheaper) red rooster sound machine in our guest room. Also, the plug for this thing is ridiculous. A micro usb plugs into the machine itself and the wall plug has a GIANT usb-to-wall base that sticks out about two inches from the wall. Add in the usb itself and this is an obscenely large obstruction sticking out of your wall. Will not fit behind anything so you’ll be looking at this eyesore.Get literally any other sound machine and you’ll be better off."
2789,3,"It was great until the past two nights when it shut off at 3:45 AM and woke up us and our baby! It had done that before when I had charged it and left it unplugged overnight. After the first time it shut off randomly in the night (about 1 month after purchasing), I decided to leave it plugged into the wall 24/7. It still turns on and plays noise for a few hours, but shuts off whenever it wants. Also, it is difficult to turn on and off, the button kind of sticks so you have to press it down hard for a long time. As the product is less than 5 months old I would have expected it to last longer. :("
2790,3,"Biggest pile of over priced crap. I dont travel with this, I just have had this plugged in and use it at night and for naps for my infant. At first I thought this was great but I have owned this since July and it no longer works. It will not keep a charge and will work for only 5 mins while plugged in before it just shuts off. It sucks because I have an infant used to this white noise and now she is not sleeping well. I have the regular marpac machines in my bedroom and my other child room so I know that this brand is usually a great and last forever, it dont waste a dime on this item. It's really too bad. I hate that I have to toss this out :("
2791,3,"Im a college student and love my bean bag chair. I be had it since I was about 14 years old (almost 8 years). Last time I moved and emptied the beans out of the chair and bought 2 of 4 months ago and it filled my bag about 90% of the way. Within in about 3 to 5 weeks I bought a 3rd bag because it was half price. (Black friday) and hoped that I wouldn't need to buy anymore. I was utterly wrong. The issue that these beans are weak and cheap. Instantly you can hear the beans popped as if to constantly remind you of the penny's you are loosing after each little movement when sitting. I bought two more of these beans refill bags And it's been 2 weeks later. I once again regretting my decision to waste money on this product. If you are a bean bag chair and bed lover like me. Don't buy this product, but the smaller micro beans are the best filler. Yes more expensive per bag but you will have a more comfortable experience with it and less headaches and lower back pain."
2792,1,"Although this product appears to be a good bean bag filler, I was surprised to see on the package that there were flame retardants added to the beans. I discovered this after I opened the package and began refilling my bean bag. My daughter and I soon developed headaches and I put the bag outside, to dump the filling out later. My family is sensitive to certain synthetic chemicals and I avoid knowingly bringing them into our home. I have bought bean bag filler before and we never had this reaction, so it never occured to me to check before opening the package. If you are sensitive to these types of chemicals or just wish to avoid them, I advise you to look for another brand of bean bag filler. I could not find this information on the Amazon listing, so I wanted to leave this review for those who might be interested in knowing this before purchasing this brand."
2793,1,"There ought to be a class action lawsuit against big joe!!! As many, many other people have stated the foam balls DO NOT expand after being crushed. When you crush them they stay crushed, they are built to break and the more you use the chair the flatter they get requiring you to purchase more. Then those go flat and again you must purchase more, and again and again!!"
2794,3,"Complete waste of my money. I'm so disappointed in this filler. The beans that came out of my Pier 1 bean bag are round and hold their shape when you smash them. These replacement beans, which I ordered because they are a top rated product on Amazon, are terrible. They are almost all flat (brand new!) and even the ones that have a slight puff to them pop and break apart when you smash them."
2795,1,"Well I purchased one bag of fill for my daughters Big joe chair. The fill looked the same as what Came out of the chair, but was not enough to fill it up. So I purchased a second bag , now I spent more money on fill then I bought the chair for. The second bag of fill arrives, it’s a totally different from the first bag, but seems stronger then the original fill. That was in December. Guess what the chair is flat already, less then one month. Don’t buy the chair, don’t buy the fill. What a waist ! Unless the “new fill is better, and I will never know for sure I’m giving this product a one star only because I can’t give it no stars."
2796,3,"These aren't shaped like Hammock at all. They're just a big circle. This makes hanging incredibly awkward. The toys were either down inside, like a drawstring sack, or if I placed the hooks farther apart, it would flop over and dump everything. We had a Jumbo Prince Lionheart one for four years that was awesome, but eventually the elastic lost its stretch. I wish I had just gone with that one again because these are a total waste of money."
2797,2,"I don't like leaving bad reviews on items. I would rather not leave one at all. But these made me so mad. The directions are horrible. They don't tell you how far from the corner of the wall to place the hooks so you have to guess. The net isn't even a triangle, it's an odd rectangle shape for the corner. We hung them up regardless since we needed something for the stuffed animals. I hate the way it looks. Just waiting to find or make something to replace them on the wall."
2798,3,"the photo looks like the regular toy net you would expect. this thing is not triangular like the photo shows its square, and the whole outside edge is elastic. the quality was poor and after struggling for a long time to hang it(since the whole thing is elastic, there are no real measurements given for hanging, it ripped as soon as I put toys in it. 2nd one did the same. get one with grommets."
2799,1,"These have no grommets to attach the hooks they provide, which means that they are hanging by the flimsy elastic and/ or the netting. The netting immediately ripped (before adding any stuffed animals). And within just a few days of added animals the elastic had stretched so much that I was constantly picking up stuffed animals out of the floor. Took them down and threw them away with less than a month of use."
2800,3,"I was really excited to buy this product for my toddler's room, when I was a child I always wanted these for my toys and nobody ever gave me one. When are you received these the directions seemed pretty straightforward and easy, but boy they were not! It took us 3 hours to install two of these. Based on the directions. And then we finally decided we were going to do it our own way. They were a disaster and super frustrating! So far they're still hanging nothing's falling out of them they haven't ripped off the wall but they're just not as high-quality as I thought they would be and the directions were very unclear. We're pretty disappointed. But, they do work."
2801,3,"I have always loved Skip Hop items for my baby including the activity center I purchased a few months ago. Today I discovered to my horror that the plastic trees which form part of the activity center, have been chewed off and almost certainly swallowed by my baby. Skip hop should recall this item immediately. It is simply not safe !"
2802,1,CAN CAUSE INJURY!I couldn't figure out why my 5 mo was screaming to get out of this chair as she loves being upright and playing with toys... Well it turns out the 'fabric' from the chair was literally cutting into her inner thighs. I AM REPORTING THIS AND HOPE TO SEE A PRODUCT RECALL. DO NOT BUY!!
2803,3,"I was so excited to purchase this and as an overall product it was a) easy to assemble and b) keeps my 5 month old content. HOWEVER, the owl pop up toy on the playstation is extremely dangerous for babies. My daughter got her finger stuck in the top of it simply by having her hand on top of it when she pushed down on the little tree arm. Her finger could have been broken but was only jammed. It was terrifying and definitely not something I want any other parents to have to endure. I highly recommend removing this owl, it is a safety hazard and Skip Hop should be careful with this addition."
2804,3,"I really wanted to love this..the look is great. The converting to a child's table in the future seems to give the product longevity however this product DOES NOT BOUNCE! Not even a little...at most my 5 month old looks like she is surfing as the platform isn't stable. There is no way for her to bounce with this product, she can swivel but the toys aren't interesting enough so she just stands for about a minute then raises her arms wanting out. This will be returned."
2805,3,"It was great for as jumping set-up. When I turned into craft table, I realized that the insert(grey part) is bend and keeps popping out. So table surface is not flat and not usable!!! Sad. And I’ve already bought a set of chairs. The child who used it to jump was very lightweight. I hope the company will respond and send me insert replacement and than I will change my review."
2806,1,"I'll get straight to the point. I was replacing 4 lunch box freeze coolers with something cute instead of the usually blue bricks you usually get. I bought the usual blue bricks at the dollar store two years ago for $1.99 each. Twice the size (or more) of these. They just now wore out to where they are starting to crack within the plastic and won't last much longer. I put these in the freezer with the blue bricks from the dollar store and 12 hours later, they still weren't frozen, blue bricks twice their size were frozen solid, as usual, after that length of time. Finally, after two days in the freezer, I took these out frozen and used them. Bricks from the dollar store are always still half-frozen when I take them out of the lunchbox (for the last two years). These were completely thawed into liquid and luke warm. I do not recommend these for any purpose whatsoever and truly regret my purchase."
2807,3,"These little penguin ice packs are ridiculously cute, but they are so thin that they do not stay cold for very long. I would not trust them to keep a lunch safely cold by themselves. It is nice that they are thin, and I think that they can work well in conjunction with larger ice packs. I use larger ice packs in my children's lunches, then slip one or two of these thin penguins on top of the lunch to provide a little extra cold. They only time I have used them alone and not in conjunction with other ice packs was because I needed to send in a morning snack only for preschool."
2808,3,"I got these for my children’s lunch boxes (butterfly shape). I thought the colors and shape would be fun for them (and they were, my son loved picking out his butterfly each morning). But I soon found they do not stay cold for very long, which is distressing when they have to keep lunches chilled from 7am-noon. I ended up ordering other ice packs instead."
2809,3,"The product is fine but the dimensions were completely wrong, this matters when they need to fit inside of a certain space. I will have to return now, as they are no use to me at this size. Also, there are 2 separate dimensions listed, both are inaccurate."
2810,3,"WAY bigger than described! I purposely bought these for the small size they claimed to be to fit in my preschooler's snack bag, which is 7""x7"". I got the dog ones, and they were HUGE! They're only supposed to be just over 4"" by just over 3"" and around 1/4"" thick. They should have been perfect for what I needed. These are at least 7"" tall on their own - a lot bigger than the description. Sending them back."
2811,3,"This item is useless. Wasted 2 hours trying to put it together, and I still don't have a table. My friend who is a carpenter also said it wouldn't fit together. The holes were drilled improperly. I tried to get a refund, but I need to send the item back, and with the pegs in the boards, it no longer fits in the box. I am now out $20, have wasted several hours with this, and am stuck with a useless pile of junk wood."
2812,1,"Poor product. I wasn’t expecting a while lot for $40 but these are even below those expectations. The parts are labeled for ease of assembly. The problem is the sticker is stronger than the laminate they put over the mdf so when you try a peel off the sticker, you actually peel off the simulated wood of the “board”.Save your money and buy something better."
2813,2,"You get what you pay for is absolutely true with this product. It was just delivered to me so I was excited to put it together to start using in my new apartment and its already broke. Screws broke off in the cheap chipboard they use, also nothing lines up with the holes. Will be throwing this away and would never buy again........"
2814,3,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. Don't waste your time. Product arrived with marks and dents all over the boards, half the hardware was missing but what was included was just thrown in the box not even in a bag, the holes on one leg were drilled an inch lower than the other three, and clearly, no need for an instruction pamphlet when it's physically impossible to set it up. Getting a refund on this waste of an item. Amazon was awesome with the refund btw."
2815,1,"The product arrived broken. The legs for the nightstand were missing holes, so the table was unbalanced.Despite the imblanace, I decided to assemble the nightstand, but the nightstand wouldn’t balance long enough to connect the pieces.This nightstand is relatively simple, but the manufacturing is poor. This is a cheap product. This is a really cheap product.Save your money on something that won’t break down on arrival... throwing this thing in the garbage where it belongs ... also, it’s very short, I would hardly consider this a night stand."
2816,3,The product dimensions are a lie. The surface area of the top shelf is actually 20 inches by 18 5/8 inches. Which means they're including the width of the legs in the table's overall dimensions to reach the 20x20x20 claim. This is false advertising because the end result is a product marketed as a square table... that's not actually square.
2817,1,"We bought these to use in a new house and just opened them tonight to assemble. The first one had sticky gunk on the metal pieces, the pressed wood panels didn't lay flat in the frame and the finish on one of the panels was damaged--the finish on about half the panel was scraped. I promptly logged on to Amazon to return and found out that I'm past the 30 days' window! Do not buy these unless you want a table that looks like you went to the thrift store to get a used Kmart item."
2818,3,"I was so excited to get this nightstand but that excitement quickly went away when I opened the box. One of the panels has a crack, there are dings all over the metal pieces, and both panels have dents and are chipping away at the edges. I put it together anyway and also found the panels to be bent out of shape, causing them to not lie flat in the frame. It was easy to put together and all the parts were included, but paying over $40 for damaged pieces, this was not worth it."
2819,3,"I ordered many products made by zinus to furnish my new apartment. When I received this end table in the mail, the hardware was missing. A table with no bolts to put it together is of no help to me. I tried looking online to see if I could purchase just the hardware set; but I found nothing."
2820,1,"This lesson cost me $75 to learn but you can learn from me for free (my gift to you)! The color is more of a warm ""red/orange"" than what is picture (hoping for a brown). The faux ""wood"" top is more like laminated cardboard. They feel sturdy, like they would last one semester in a college dorm (why it's 1 star instead of zero), but I wouldn't suggest buying them (even at a lower price point). Stick with thrifting if you are on a budget. At least I didn't bite on other Zinus deals for larger price tag items."
2821,1,"I had to give one star as the minimum rating for this product because I am very disappointed: it looks better on the photo the what came out of the box. I will take you through the assembly process.The aprons (E1) are affixed under the top of the table (B1), but when you try to screw the side panels (A1) the pre-drilled holes the the side panels are not aligned with those at both ends of the aprons; as a result the aprons and side panels are not ""flush"".When you had the shelf (C1), you will note that there is a gap between the side of the shelf and the side panels (A1); you cannot tight the screws too tight, otherwise you will damage the shelf.Lastly, when assembling the drawer, the back and side panel are not well-adjusted and one cannot tight the screws too much because the panels are easily damages, because of the poor quality of the material; the composite material breaks easily and develop a crack. The surprise comes when you insert the drawer under the top: it does not feel well and does not close properly because it is a tight fit.Aside from the hexagonal wrench/key, you should only require a screwdriver to assemble the drawer. However, I will have to get a smoothing bench plane to ""fix"" the drawer if I want it to fit properly into its location. If I had known that the end-product would be as expected, I would have made my own table from scratch.This article is not recommended."
2822,3,"Looks nice but the color was not as shown. Says walnut and shows dark brown but more like golden oak color which is ok can use in another room. So only gave a 3 star for that reason. Haven't tried to put it together yet.Ok started putting it together and one screw is stripped and creates a problem and like other comments the drawer is not very deep and the bottom of drawer is laminated cardboard, you couldn't put anything heavy unless maybe a magazine. I bought 2 and only have one partially put together. I have to get someone to help since I am not able to tighten the screws where it isn't wobbly. I am going to see if they will let me return them."
2823,3,I like that it's made mostly made out of wood. I was ready to return the table when the first two long screws stripped before I could tighten them. They had to be removed very carefully with pliers. The provided tool did not properly fit the hex headed screws and stripped very easily making them unusable. The door color did not match the rest of the table. When I get tired of looking at it I will paint the whole thing. I replaced the provided screws with pocket screws.
2824,1,"I sure wish I would have spent a little more and ordered a better product. I read the reviews on this and they seemed pretty good. Man, people must really be used to buying garbage because this is not a good product. The drawer arrived chipped. This is super flimsy and cheaply made. And the worst part? It looks primed, NOT painted white. The brush strokes show and inconsistently I might add. The drawer is a completely different shade than the top. It honestly just looks sort of primed white. I won't bother to return because honestly, it's a hassle. But I'm not happy about it and now will have to eat the cost and spend twice as much on a real nightstand instead. I do not recommend."
2825,3,This had the potential to be a decent table but it has numerous flaws. The bottom shelf is poorly aligned making the bolts impossible to tighten with the provided allen wrench which stripped and became useless. Trying to assemble the drawer without any issues was a pipe dream. The parts did not line up properly and one of the side parts split to where it would not hold a screw. I could go on and on but the bottom line is that this is not a winner.
2826,3,"Disappointed, but truly, you get what you pay for. It’s cheap for a reason.I bought this for my living room to use as a laptop table and other miscellaneous uses. Thought it would be nice enough for a main living space based on many reviews saying it was far nicer than the $ paid for it. I sincerely disagree - this table at any bit higher price would be a laughable. It’s worth is in the $30-$40 range. Unless you really need it for a laptop table, then it’s worthless.Functionally:Too short to use as a laptop/work table for an adult. It needs to be 2-3” taller, even with the casters on. It barely clears my legs sitting up straight on the couch and I’m an average size female. So it’s pretty much worthless for the purpose I needed it to serve.Easy to assemble, my seventeen year old daughter did it with no hiccups.Decently sturdy, pretty light weight. I don’t expect it to stand the test of time. The casters are good quality. But overall I would compare to IKEA quality.Aesthetically:This is where it fails for me. UGLY wood veneer top. The rustic look was a completely fail, it just looks cheap and fake. And I was hopeful on the top, this is what so many others raved about. The rest is what it is, light weight black square tubing and silver casters. Industrial, not nowhere close to a quality cool chic industrial look.So, it was a waste of money. Too ugly to leave in my main living space and worthless as a work table."
2827,3,I purchased several of the round tables like this and they are beautiful. I purchased this rectangular one and it’s horrific. There are so many danmaged areas on the wood surface and when putting it together several screws going into the metal didn’t fit because the areas were cracked. Unfortunately we got it together and it would be too much to send it back so we’re stuck with it!!!
2828,1,"READ MEASUREMENTS BEFORE YOU BUY.. looks good online. Very small in person.But... even if you were looking for this size.The quality is underwhelming. Framing is cheap and the nuts welded into the frame to except the screws, looked like it blown out the ends. Doesn’t finish flush to together. Table top: I understand it’s not Laminate with particle board. But it looked cheap and ready to chip on the corners. Well, sure enough. We installed it on carpet, laying it down, as shown on instructions. We lifted it up.. and edge of laminate was coming up on the edge. Not worthy to last with everyday use.And now packaging: Our first delivery came with missing casters. After reading reviews, it seems this is common.I would not recommend this based off of Size, quality, and expectations."
2829,3,"I wish I would have read the negative reviews and noted the height at only 24"". The marketing picture with it on a thin couch with short legs is deceptive. I wanted something so I could chill on the couch and eat or work on my computer and this will not be it. Fortunately I needed an end table next to my bed so I will keep it but still looking.Assembly was easy but the top and bottom metal frames are very similar and instructions are images only. The bottom frame has the bolts welded on for the castors or slides, which it does come with both and wrench and allen needed to assemble. Good quality and easy assembly kept if from being a one star."
2830,3,"It is the quality of 10$. The metal finishes are very flimsy and cheap.It only came with 3 wheels and I contacted the amazon first. But amazon told me I have 2 options- return the item vs. call the manufacture.I called the manufacture multiple times during their business hours however, it only has voice mail. The voice mail box was full. So basically there is no customer service.I assembled everything without counting the wheels first and I m too lazy to return the item.Although it is cheaply light, I have to lift it to move it around so it kinda work out for me.The wood looking part is made of laminate and looks very cheap. I know that it will probably peel over time."
2831,3,"Good product, but didn’t meet my needs. The part that lays flat was too large for my motorhome sofa arm. Not complaining about the product, but when I tried to return it, they wanted to charge me $7.54 return shipping. That’s outrageous for a $25 product. Amazon should pull this seller for unscrupulous practices. Make sure if you buy it, you want it, because like me, you’ll be stuck with it."
2832,3,"This *ALMOST* works. The quality is high, the color and finish great, but it's still easy to knock over when getting up or moving around, despite the weights.I ended up driving a screw through the cupholder into the couch, and trimming the weights off. Works great now.SO, it *ALMOST* worked as intended."
2833,1,"This product doesn't really fit as snugly on my sofa arm as it might appear that it would based on the images. It's quite loose and could easily be knocked off the couch arm (sending my beverage flying) with a fairly light bump/nudge.I think the reason is that on the outside of the couch, the couch arm sort of tapers inward. This leaves the outer arm of the coaster just dangling in the air.I would caution anyone with a tapered inward couch arm to avoid this product."
2834,3,As soon as I took it out and saw”As seen on tv.” On the box I knew I made a mistake. It doesn’t fit on the arm of my couch. I thought it clamped to the couch but no. It’s like two heavy dog ears that flop over the arm of your couch. It slides around and will cause you to spill your drinks not stop you. You might as well just turn your drink upside down onto the couch or the floor and get it over with. The cup holder doesn’t fit my cup. It’s too small for the insert and too big when you take it out. Maybe I can tie it around my head in a bow and sing yippity doo dah day. Idk. <U+2639> .
2835,3,The holder has an insert which is about right size for a 12 oz can. The insert can removed for larger diameters. My experience is too few drinks with diameter to fit insert and hole too big for most of other glasses without insert.
2836,3,"I like the color, design, and overall quality of the bookcase. Unfortunately, the design of the top shelf is faulty. The front top piece screws into the top. The way that the guide holes are drilled allow the screws to be pushed through the top. So, now the top is damaged in two places. Unsightly. They could easily make the holes so that it would be impossible to damage the top or they could have supplied shorter screws. Very disappointed."
2837,3,"No excuse for similar damage to 8 of the 15 cabinets ordered for the New Jersey Maritime Museum. It appears that perhaps someone at the factor dropped a pallet of these, resulting in the damage to the top section of these cases. It's unrealistic to disassemble 15 bookcases to return to the manufacturer; if these damaged tops aren't replaced (which will still require the cabinets to be disassembled just to replaced the damaged tops) I will have no choice but to have the company pick them up. UPDATE: Spoke to Barb at Sauder and she is sending out replacement tops for the damaged units."
2838,3,Well... statistically you would think at least one of the two products purchased wouldn’t be broken... however this is why I don’t play the lottery. Both bookcases had cracks in the top shelf. One (shown) is very significant and is on the area that faces up. The other one has the crack that faces down but will still compromise the integrity of the top. It took a lot of effort to get all this unboxed and I’m not boxing it up again... Sauder can send me 2 new tops (uncracked please) or I won’t even bother putting this together.
2839,3,"I've bought $300 bookshelves, $50 bookshelves, and $20 bookshelves. Unlike this bookshelf, the screws for them worked. The locking peg system for this bookshelf would likely hold 20 lbs before falling apart. I think the pegs are too small for the drilled holes, as other reviews say.Additionally, while putting this together the sharp edges of the slide-together pressboard shelving left me with some pretty gnarly cuts on my fingers.Overall a pretty terrible bookshelf. Its sharp and likely to collapse.One star because it looks moderate. The back of it, like most bookshelves, is the cheap fold-out cardboard backing that gives away how cheap it is."
2840,3,"Sauder 2-Shelf Bookcase (413792). The package arrived in good shape. No damage to box or heavy cardboard outside wrapping. I normally inspect all material but must have missed turning the TOP (E) of bookcase over to see other side... (yeah, my bad). It turns out the bottom side of TOP (E) on one end was cracked. I used a dark brown marker (supplied by Sauder for my computer desk) to paint over this crack as best I could. But when I went to assemble the unit, the TOP end that was cracked was bowed upward as seen in the photo. I am going to say that this crack was not due to shipping, but was already in this condition from the factory. I will not be returning this unit. I will try to make due and glue and clamp this TOP end down to see if that works."
2841,3,"The table arrived with multiple scratches in the wood. Which, for a ""reclaimed"" piece can sometimes add character, however, this looked like a factory defect and I sent it back. It looked ok, the wood was genuine but not very impressive, the color was dull and the wood pattern was boring. I was hoping for something with some character. It seemed strong enough, just not very attractive. I may reorder, I haven't decided."
2842,1,"The Amazon product description is incorrect. It says this table is made of ""metal and wood"". Let me correct this: ""lightweight metal and terrible looking, cheap feeling plastic"". It says the finish is ""faux wood finish"", but no one could mistake this for wood. Save your money...I saw a table of a very similar size with a much nicer looking top at Home Goods for the same price last week."
2843,3,One of those things that you get it and then you realize you could have lived without it just fine. Just more clutter around the house now.Update. 100 percent regret this. The screws get lose pretty much every week and have to tighten it. It gets wobbly. Bad product.
2844,1,"My biggest complaint with this item is the fake wooden top. It's plastic, and doesn't look even remotely like realistic wood. It rings hollow when rapped or tapped, and has an extremely plastic feel to it. The top has a very grey color to it that doesn't even REMOTELY look like any wood I know, much less reclaimed wood.The item is easy to construct, although the two screws in the bottom frame-piece and two in the top frame-piece are at the joints. If you tighten them too much, you may cause the joint to separate and cause the item to fail and fall apart. There are only six plastic nubs. Four are used for the feet of the item. Two are used between the top frame-piece and the faux wood panel, but there need to be four here.If you want a very cheap-looking, very inexpensive side table for a rec room or child's room, this would be fine. For anything lese, I would not recommend it."
2845,2,"Bought based on price and relatively decent reviews. Overall disappointed in the product quality, cheap and wobbly and the ""wood"" looks and feels incredibly fake. I tried tightening the base and it just stripped, and still wobbles. It didn't take long for this to end up in the basement, eventually to make it's way to a garage sale. I found a better quality one, and cheaper at TJ's."
2846,3,"Ordered two of these tables for a new couch in my home. The first one I opened and assembled with no issues, only to find the base to be lopsided; making it wobble when on a flat surface straight out of the box. It looks as though the L-shaped pieces that the top is screwed on to were simply different lengths. Disappointing, but decided to keep it despite it being defective just to save myself the trouble of returning it. Then again, I had a second one that I was sure would be just fine.I then assembled the second one, no wobble. Good so far. Got through the last step of assembly to find out the table top provided came out of the box with a small but visible chip on the edge and a shiny stain that almost resembled grease or maybe the wood finish but poorly applied.0/2 on this product despite otherwise getting good reviews. Will be keeping the tables but am thoroughly disappointed in the quality of both straight out of their boxes."
2847,3,"I assumed by the description of an MDF top, there was a wood veneer over the MDF (like most things these days) but it is cheap, ugly contact paper with wood grain printed on it. It looks so fake. Very cheap. Very disappointed. Looks like it cost $3.00 to make."
2848,3,"The top looks like it's particle board covered in contact paper, and there's a scrape in the cover. One of the pieces that attached to the top didn't line up, so we had to bend and force it to be able to screw the top in. The paperwork says they'll send replacement parts, so I might try that, but it seems quality control wasn't the best."
2849,3,The table wobbles on the floor cause the legs are not adjustable. The top looks really cheap. Tangkula tried to talk me into keeping it cause it's 17$ to ship it back. I'm trying to return but can't get a return label.
2850,3,"Bought two. Have been using them daily for ~ 6 months. The tray surface bubbles, but not pealed. For some reasons, one of the trays is slanted slightly in an angle, like a glass of water can almost slide off the tray. I wonder what is happening. The whole thing (except the tray) is made out of metal and it's not bent. The other one had screws come loose recently."
2851,3,Cheaply made. The metal looks like it’s going to crumble if screws are tight. Meaning it’s not going to last very long. The designed squares are made out of compressed cardboard. The peg rubber feet have no placement. I’m stuck with no hole to place these screw on feet. Missing a part apparently.
2852,3,"This table is very cheaply made, and the dimensions they show are rounded up. It's quite tiny. lol The ""wood"" top is a thin piece of particle board covered in reddish vinyl, that tore as I was assembling the table. And the black paint was chipping off as I was putting it together. Not worth the price at all. I wouldn't even pay half what they charge. I immediately returned it."
2853,2,"I am still awaiting my refund for this product (it's taking forever, by the way) that came damaged. The holes DO NOT line up in order to get the screws in! You can tell it's cheaply made. I really regret this purchase and wish their customer service was better. The one star is generous. Target has some already assembled that are much more durable and far less hassle! Stick with what you know. I will be sure to avoid this brand from now on. I would've given them a second chance if they had ever given me my money back! C'mon!"
2854,3,"the product came crooked - the middle part where the square designs are) and it was too hard to screw them to the side bars because you have to really stretch the metal for it to align to the sides. also, after trying to get it to work, one of them (i purchased two) is wobbly. shipping was fast but that wouldn't matter."
2855,3,"This was disappointing. You will note in the pictures, 1): a screw hole was just too small and the screw wouldn't go in all the way, this holds the table together. 2) the braces that you screw the table to the metal aren't flush, therefore you can't screw it on tightly. 3) The table comes with 4 padded screws for the bottom of the table, however, there are no holes in the bottom to put the screws in. Don't know if you can see these issues in the pictures or not, however- clearly this is a mock table with directions to an identical table this is better constructed."
2856,2,"I was excited to receive this table based on the great reviews I had read. When it arrived, my husband was able to put it together pretty quickly. Contrary to the reviews, the materials used to make this are actually pretty cheap and it was not worth the money we spent on it, but the design looked good and was a perfect fit for the space so we intended to keep it - until I entered the room where my husband was putting it together and was met with the OVERWHELMING SMELL of very strong fumes coming from the table which gave me a headache. We tried airing it out but the strong off-gassing still persisted (especially after the lid is closed). I do not feel comfortable exposing my family (and especially my young children) to toxic and potentially carcinogenic fumes day and in day out, so we are returning it. There is no avoiding the smell and I'm actually surprised by the amount of people who gave this product 4 and 5 star reviews. I wouldn't keep this thing if it was given to me for free. There is no need for a table to give off this level of sickening fumes."
2857,3,"While I had ordered one end-table before and liking it decided to order another, secend item that came did not match the color of the first and I had to return it, driving 40 miles to return point and back. The third item came with many visible scratches and chipped parts on top and someone had tried to paint it with an unmatching-colored pencil making it worst. The UPS driver that was supposed to pick it up did not ring the bell and left a card and disappeared. As I had already assembled it, I kept it and will try to fix it myself. What a disappointment."
2858,3,"Update:Left in a covered area outside one evening hoping the fresh air would help. Brought it back into the garage and continued to wipe it down with a soapy rag and dry it completely once a day for about a week. Paint began to buckle, and even still the smell persisted.I would not recommend this item in white, I'm not sure if the other finishes have the same issue. This was meant for my daughter's room and I would not feel comfortable having an item that smelled his strongly of chemicals where any person lives, let alone a child.Bought the White model. Let it sit unpacked in the garage for a couple weeks before I put it together, and now it's spent a couple days outside. The smell is still pretty strong, though not as bad as it was when I first took out of the box. This item was meant for my daughter's room, I will give it another couple weeks to off-gas before I decide what I'm going to do with it.Cam locks won't stay tightened, and I may have to you superglue them in place.Not a terrible piece of furniture, but not great either."
2859,3,"I've redecorated my whole house primarily from Amazon and this is the ONLY product I've been pissed about. The company is honestly terrible. I loved my side table, but I received a piece without predrilled holes and there is no way to guess the deminsion, or put it together without them. I called the company right away and explained everything which they were SOO nice, said they'd send me a replacement, then asked me to send an email containing pictures to ensure the product was faulty. I sent this right after I got off the phone with the manager. After 2 weeks of waiting I touched base via email and received nothing back. I waited another week and sent another email and received nothing back. Starting to get annoyed, I called every single number listed on the instruction manual and tried every department and no one would take my calls. I was on the phone for over an hour while I did chores hoping I would be annoying enough to just pick the call up, but nope! it's been about 90 days so I guess I'll cut my losses and throw it away. I'm pissed I spent this money for nothing. It's wrong when all I was asking for was dimensions or one piece of the table which is inexpensive. Although I had these issues I still have to say the table looks very nice. Wish I could actually use it <U+0001F624>."
2860,3,"This table goes together OK, problem being bad parts and not a very good installation system. Parts #2 And 3 had screw holes that were not drilled right and they stripped out and split, DANG PARTICLE BOARD. I went back to the manufacturer for parts like a good boy and they wanted me to jump through hoops backwards so I packed it back up and returned to Amazon. I just hate to have to return stuff but, (Thank you Amazon, you are the very best). Who knows, yours might be perfect!"
2861,3,2 stars for getting the product quickly. The bad part is how terrible the material is. Upon assembly the veneer was starting to fall off due to cheap materials. There are so many other materials that would be better used. I wish I would of just made my own not worth the money.
2862,3,All of the corners arrived damaged. I believe the package it came in was more than enough to protect the table. This makes me believe the table was damaged before it was put in the box.
2863,3,"These are midget sized coffee tables. They don't even reach the arms of our couches. Yes, they are easy to assemble and easy to take a part as they wobble with any exertion. I suggested we use them instead to hold our office equipment and my husband just laughed. This purchase is a low on the list of my amazon shopping career."
2864,3,"First the pros: I like the color and size of this table, and it seems fairly sturdy for how inexpensive it was.Unfortunately mine arrived with one of the top sides somewhat smashed in. There were also some scratches on one of the legs. For the price, it’s not worth the hassle to try to return it so I just put that side up against the wall and it’s not super obvious."
2865,3,"While this is inexpensive, it is not very sturdy. I returned it and purchased one from IKEA instead. The IKEA parsons table is slightly larger but much sturdier and has a nicer looking finish. As well, it is comparably priced."
2866,1,"DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BELIEVE THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE GOOD REVIEWS! these were total junk. I bought two and both came defective, the leg on the first to arrive was not cut properly. You could clearly tell it was missing a notch cut. The legs were dfferent shades and appeared to range from dark brown to almost a maple finish. The second to arrive had similar issues, in order to get the legs on I would have had to hammer them in, with the hopes that I could then line up and tighten stools which was unlikely at best. The cushion on this stool was poorly sewn in multiple places. These were made by blind blinders with shakey handsends!"
2867,1,"This has got to be the worst product I have ever come across. The legs do not fit into the stools. The one out of six (yes six) stools I have received that did fit, was missing hardware for the pieces that go in between the legs. The company sent me FOUR other replacement stools and same exact problem with each. Actually, I didn’t even open the fourth replacement I was so done with this whole situation. The second replacement set they claimed was going to come from their factory and they were going to do a “quality control” on them. Yeah right. Do not waste any time buying these. Do not accept replacements. This product should not be on amazon."
2868,3,"So I tried to somehow contact the seller but i couldn't find anywhere to do that so hopefully they see this and respond to this.I ordered this because the pictures look great and in the product description it says several times in several different places that the material is ""marble."" However, when I opened this the ""marble"" was really cheap looking and feeling plastic!!! This plastic also sat upon pressed paper like frame (the legs are solid wood) so even if i were to go to buy my own stone to replace the frame wouldn't even be able to support the weight of marble or a stone! what the hell! i am so annoyed and disappoint. why would they even consider calling this marble."
2869,2,These chairs were horrible! We bought 1 to see if we liked it. Which we did. I ordered 3 more and put them together. All 3 had cross bars in different spots. The legs didn’t fit and cracked when we tried to screw them together. It’s like the legs were for the 24” chair not the 29” which is what we ordered. We returned all 4. There is zero quality control for these chairs. Terrible!
2870,1,"Buyer beware! If you hear cracking when you screw the legs together, STOP! SEND IT BACK! You have just compromised your structure. This could cause serious injury or harm when it breaks. The holes were not drilled threw all the way and will not fasten securely. The lock nuts are cheap and will break. The wood will break. At least one leg will not fit correctly when putting it together after matching it to the right sticker. The side pieces are not cut at an angle to fit snugly to the curvature of the legs. I will show you what it looks like when you disassemble the legs. The tacs were not straight across. For the amount of money spent on this, it should be perfect and easy to assemble with any defects and complications. The advertisement is false and is not securely made, once those legs have cracks in them after you have assembled them, they are more liable to break and then you could have a lawsuit on your hands and who knows what else."
2871,3,"This doesn't actually snap together. It fits, but is slides into place precariously and can't actually be moved once assembled- you need to entirely disassemble it, or risk it falling apart as you carry it. Frustrating user experience that caused some damage to other household items when it, you know, fell apart in the middle of being moved."
2872,3,"This product looks amazing and is going to look fantastic in my classroom. The only upsetting part about this is the quality of the table on the bottom. I took it out of the box, on the floor, and there was a gash on the bottom and a small part of the table has started to come apart. Also, the bottom part of the table is very scuffed up (this could've been done by transportation)."
2873,3,"the finish on the top is strange…is looks like someone layer cheesecloth on the wet finish…you can see the texture. The metal on the base was tarnished and I got black on my hands putting it together. The underside was chipped. For the price, I will keep it but it is not what I expected on the finish. It should be smooth."
2874,1,"I get this table for a party after reading lots and lots of happy reviews. I believe the buyers were happy with the smaller tables. This table does NOT required any hardware for assembly! You just put a 36"" top on its column! That is all. The top is spinning, and wobbles. I would never risk putting anything on that table.Maybe it is possible to improve the design by myself, I decided not to try. Returned it to Amazon. Had a hard time packing it back. Regret this purchase, will not recommend."
2875,2,"Table arrived with two 6 inch score marks. Perhaps the legs got loose and did the damage. Box was fine. While I expect this table to take wear and tear through use in an office setting, it should not arrive this way.
I don't have the time to repackage and send this item back. I'll just settle on a scuffed table, but I won't buy it again."
2876,3,"TLDR - If I could give this negative stars at this point, I would.All was fine until I was about 80% of the way through assembly and went to insert the pieces labeled #10. I then discovered that the rabbets in piece #15 were not cut in the correct location. This causes piece #15 not to line up with the rabbets in the other pieces that ensure piece(s) #10 seat flush. Ultimately this makes it impossible to install piece #1 (in step 14) correctly. For reference, this review corresponds to the assembly instructions for item #W58CSP-MT, revised 05/2017.*Update - After several back and forth emails with Walker Edison (the manufacturer), they sent me a replacement piece. However, much to my surprise, they sent me the wrong piece (piece #4 rather than #15 as requested). Words can't adequately express the frustration I'm feeling at this point with this TV stand. I WANT to like it, it looks like it will suit my needs perfectly (in an apartment with a strict lease about mounting things/altering the drywall), but Walker Edison is making that impossible."
2877,3,"I really liked this TV stand and most of the reviews were positive so I decided to buy it. Upon arrival the box was very damaged but I still hoped the stand would be intact, however, this wasnt the case. One of the larger panels has an obvious crack down the center support which a lot of the TV's weight has to rest on. I attempted to put the stand together despite having this damaged product however with time, the TV stand will not last. Try to find a better stand if possible."
2878,3,"Looks nice in pictures and the finish on the wood is nice, BUT this item is a piece of junk!! The clasps don't hold the wood is that particle board that is not sturdy!! I had three bolts that broke thru the wood!! Nothing held together, once u had everything in place and tried to.move it into place everything fell apart!! Wish I was able to return it. But I threw away all the packaging after I opened it!! So I flushed a$100 down the toilet!!"
2879,1,"Well, this was a disaster.I'm not one to turn my nose at cheap, put it together yourself furniture. I love it, I really do. This, however, was the worst experience I've ever had. The included screws, bolts, wood pieces, etc. were so weak that the screws stripped immediately upon beginning to tighten and the cam locks split into two or three pieces when tightened. The wood split in so many places.It sure did look nice coming out the box. The materials included are sub par, however, and, I can only imagine, dangerous. Promptly returned for a refund from Amazon."
2880,3,"I purchased this tv stand and the first time it was received one of the pieces was broken. I then had to re-box it and have it re-delivered an entire week later. Once I received the ""replacement"" I opened it to put It together and their were NO INSTRUCTIONS. Smh needless to say purchasing this tv stand was a waste of time and it's very heavy to constantly send back bc of packing issues that I had nothing to do with. I’m very disappointed and this is a complete waste of time and energy."
2881,3,it’s cute but it’s the third time the legs have broken. I haven’t put anything heavy on it or leaned on it. The legs just snap from the slightest weight and then the table becomes crooked or wont even stand on its own anymore. I’ve tried to glue them in place three times now.
2882,3,"Just received and found there is a problem with the main base. One slot for a leg is cut too wide and deep, so that leg does not fit snugly and is a little wobbly. As an elderly apartment dweller, I lack either tools or materials to try to make a black shim or two to correct for the error. The adjusters are not adequate to overcome this fault, and attempting to rewrap all the pieces to return this item would be difficult as it was necessary to cut the paper rotections. I am not satisfied, but no manufacturer name or address aears on the brief instruction sheet, so I cannot request a replacement wooden base."
2883,3,"When i opened the box, I was excited because the color was perfect. Once assembled, this table was extremely crooked. I tried several times to screw the leg into the table top, but each time it came out to almost a 45° angle. Upon further inspection, the top of the leg wasn't cut level. My boyfriend had to work with it and though it's not perfectly level, it'll have to do. Disappointed."
2884,3,"I purchased this product as a Christmas gift and forgot my daughter told me there was a defect in the base, making the table very wobbly. At first I didn't know exactly what she was talking about. Now it is a little late to return the table. I went to her house and saw the problem for myself, and now I read other reviews that describe the same problem. The three legs each have a protruding piece of wood that slides into a groove in the base. Once the legs are in place there is a wooden disk that screws into the bottom of the base to hold the legs in place. Only one of the legs was held securely in place by the wooden disk because either the protruding pieces of wood or the three grooves were not exactly the same size or shape. To fix the problem I took a regular kitchen sponge and traced the shape of the wooden disk onto the sponge using a magic marker. Then I cut a round section of sponge a little smaller than the traced guide. That way if the sponge were pushed down on it would expand to a smaller diameter than that of the wooden disk. I made a hole in the center of the round sponge piece in order to insert the screw that protrudes from the center of the wooden disk. Prior to screwing the wooden disk into the bottom of the table base I put the sponge on the screw. Then I screwed the disk into the base as tightly as I could. In my case, the sponge was not very pliable or perhaps a little too thick. So, I dampened the sponge enough to make it more pliable. Then I screwed the disk into the base using as much force as I could. You will need to push down on the disk as you turn it or you won't get the screw into the grooves that hold it into the base. I am a small woman; so I am not that strong. A stronger person may not have to dampen the sponge and probably shouldn't screw the disk in as tight as they possibly can. Over tightening may break off the wooden disk or strip the grooves that hold the screw in place. The sponge filled in all the gaps created by the unevenly manufactured wooden parts. As a result, the legs were securely in place. Don't forget to make the sponge a little smaller than the disk, or it will bulge out and show. My sponge shows a little, but I can put a little black paint over it, or get a thinner sponge. If I had used a little thinner sponge it probably wouldn't show. The sponge has to be thick and sturdy enough to fill in all the spaces between the grooves the legs fit into and the disk and maintain a good sturdy grip. My only worry is that the damp sponge will get moldy if it doesn't dry right away. That is another reason to use a sponge that is pliable enough and not so thick that it needs to be wet in order to squish it down enough to get the screw into the base. Other than the wiggling legs, the table is made of what appears to be a good solid and heavy wood which gives a good quality appearance. It is not a light weight junky table. I hope this helps you if you want to keep your table."
2885,3,Cute. I love the look. But it didn’t assemble properly. The bottom part that holds the legs in place doesn’t screw on properly and instead the screw went through it. Therefore if it’s moved the legs are wobbly and it can’t be picked up and moved. Cute though.
2886,1,Have to return it. The alignment was off and the metal is not reliable. It's better for a teen or child. I can easily bend the support with my hand and it's light and flimsy. I don't return products even if they suck so this is my first time. My bf put it together and it's like they drilled the holes in the wrong place. The packaging was neat and assembly wasn't too bad. But I ignored the reviews and bought. I'm not a picky shopper but this was no good. I bought the 8 in mattress to go with but I haven't sat on it. A plus is that it arrived really fast. Beware when purchasing.
2887,1,"Assembly not very easy, screws didn't fit right & ended up w/ several sticking out (not sure if you can tell in pic; I ended up getting rid of it when I moved cause it wasn't even worth the hassle...). Mattress I got was too heavy for it so once I laid it flat it was impossible to put in the sitting position w/o removing mattress (ridiculous). Oh I forgot to mention it actually FLIPPED when two people tried to sit on it *I weigh 102 lbs., the other person weighed 160 lbs.* Worst frame I've ever owned.PROS: CheapCONS: You get what you pay for...Screws didn't fitMetal came already scratched in placesVERY unsturdy/unstableOverall – junk."
2888,3,"The hinge is incredibly small and cannot support more than 350lbs. I know this for a fact because it broke while I was sitting on it. The screw closest to the middle got pulled through the metal tube so all the weight is now on the outside screw. Having the screws be no more than 6"" from each other is a recipe for disaster and I have no idea why the company thought that was a good idea. The frame also does not come with washers so I would strongly suggest you get some before using this frame. It also sits incredibly low to the ground, so if you're tall it can be a little difficult to get out of; but that's more of a personal opinion take on it."
2889,2,"Bought this frame to go with the futon mattress I bought from DHP. Unfortunately, the mattress doesn’t bend easily so in order to turn the futon into a sofa from the bed mode, you have to stick your foot under the moving part to hold the frame down so you can force it to bend. It worked, but I lost a toe nail in the process.If you’re in the market for a futon, I’d recommend spending 200$+ on a set that comes complete instead of from this company.Sorry DHP, you lost a customer today."
2890,3,"These have been the worst things I have ever boughten at Amazon. I bought these in May 2018. And 2 months later these front wires that are to be holding my futon mattress brake and they broke completely, I can’t even screw them back on because it messed up the metal completely. And then 3 months after that now one of the frames won’t close because the mechanic that folds the frame twisted and broke. Now I’m calling my warranty and they can’t do anything. They don’t even reply to any emails (3 that I have sent.) this is so frustrating."
2891,3,Hardly good enough even for my toddler’s room. I have a baby blanket on it so i don’t have to feel the fabric which is grainy/scratchy. It is also very thin fabric too. My cat stretched on it and it already got holes.
2892,1,"If I could buy this product again, would I? No. There's a blue couch sleeper from ikea that is like 150 bucks or so. I bought that couch and removed the legs from it and was hoping this chair would be the same thing. In reality, it's really short and uncomfortable to sit on for long periods of time. Def buy something else. Easy to transport up a flight of stairs though."
2893,1,"Not comfortable at all. The back of the sofa does not lie flat when in bed form, but is higher than the rest of the mattress. Could not sleep on it, and it was too big to ship back. I would avoid this, unless you are very short or like beds with built in head rests."
2894,1,"Smaller than described. The chair is 6"" thick and very cushy. However, the top cushion (back of chair) does not lie flat when you open it up. I read other reviews about this, but was lead to believe that you could still lie on the main part as long as you were under 5' 10"". I am only 5' 5"" and my feet hang off the ends when my head is all the way to the base of the top cushion, unless my neck is wrenched upward on the cushion. Since I prefer to not have my head in that upright position, it does not work as intended. My daughter who is only 5' 2"" fits on it perfectly. I would not recommend this product for adults, as it will not accommodate most."
2895,3,"Comfy and roomy as a chair (would make a great chair to curl up and read in). Easy to unfold into a bed and refold. Light enough to move from room to room. Bed is wide enough for a curvy adult and long enough for an average height adult. (Guest was 5'6""). Color goes well with most decor."
2896,2,"It's years later, and I still hate it. The matress is far too big for the frame that it was supposed to fit. It is inflexible and so I thinkk I would have to put bags of cement on it to make it conform to the futon. It's so big that the back of the matress is about three feet above the futon frame. It is comfortable to sleep on when the frrame is flat out. I bought to futon is serve as a couch, but it is definelty not that. It's a bed. Don't buy it unless you want a bed only. This is what I wrote when I first got it: My mattress arrived today. It is beige and not green. I stretched out on it and it's like bags of cement. It's too big and heavy to send back. I will keep it. Annoyed that it is not green. The beige color is an ugly shade. I hope that as it gets uncompressed it won't feel like bags of cement. I'll edit the review if it gets more comfortable. The mattress is still pretty hard and sort of comfortable. I can hardly believe how ugly that shade of beige is. Also, the packaging was in tatters when the mattress arrived. I am glad the mattress didn't fall out of the box. I've had this thing for a few months and it's still hard and uncomfortable. You need a three-inch mattress pad because of the size and depth of the buttons. The color remains ugly. I can't believe that any company would send this big heavy thing in the wrong color. They must know that few customers would have the heart or the physical strength to return it. A bummer. I keep it in the basement so no one can see the ugly color. I'm glad it's not human. Its feelings would be hurt."
2897,3,"This is not new, it is stained and dirty!! First of all it took 6 days to ship though I chose 2nd day, then I requested a cancellation several times and was ignored, they tried to charge my card twice, then when UPS did not pick it up to return, I decided to keep it and opened it to find STAINS. See the picture, this has gross circle oil stains. DID YOU SELL ME A USED MATTRESS? I am very upset I want this thing picked up and I want a refund that is disgusting how is it stained inside the plastic?"
2898,3,"My understanding, from the description, is that it would be 12"" of memory foam with a cotton twill cover. It's hard and a rock. I've slept on memory foam before and it was much softer, which is what prompted me to get this. In addition, it's too thick to sit up properly when I prop up the bed into a couch. It starts a gradual slide off the frame. All in all, very disappointing."
2899,1,"From the start I've had nothing but problems with this mattress!!!The way it was folded - Yes, Folded and not Rolled, it must have gotten really hot along the way, cause some of the memory foam Melted at the folds where the rope was, and so have had a huge lump in the middle of the mattress. I opened the mattress cover and found that the memory foam had melted into hard plastic, so I know this to be true. The mattress - after spending the money on it that I did, is soon to be tossed!!! Be-Ware!!!-If I could give it Zero stars, I would!"
2900,3,"It works well, but its so annoying. If you know what youre getting into with a cotton futon mattress, then by all means buy it but it weighs alot, i needed a cover anyways cause the stock one ripped from the weight. Size is not definite so it never fits on the frame, and it mushes in wherever i sit or sleep."
2901,3,"I can feel the wooden slats on my behind. It was happening first day. Previous futons have not had this issue and I should have spent more time and money.Two weeks in. Napped successfully in seating position. Seating is totally compressed (and I am 6'1"" at 147#.) Skinny. As soon as the new one arrives this will be discarded. Downgraded to one star from two."
2902,1,A separation down the middle happenes very quickly. It flattens the material very quickly and become really uncomfortable to sit or lay on. This didn't even last a month for me. I am not impressed with the product and don't wish anyone else the disatisfaction I I having.
2903,3,"At first I was happy with this mattress, and it is fairly comfortable. When it ripped right down the zipper about a month into use however, my feelings changed. If you're going to buy this, spend the extra money on 3 year protection and then get ready to figure out how to get it replaced within a couple months."
2904,1,"I got the mattress rolled up. I unrolled it, put in on the mattress frame, and waited for it to inflate. It never did. This mattress is about the same as a 4"" topper, but less comfortable. It had no firmness at all, and when I laid down in it, I felt every slat in the frame. Now I have to return it, and I don't have an easy way to roll it up, or get it to the UPS store.AVOID THIS RIP OFF!!!"
2905,3,"Zipper has fallen apart after about 1 year, and the innards exposed, which are mostly recycled cotton batting (not ""memory foam"", although there might be some foam in there somewhere, I honestly didn't look very close). Very thick, and won't ""fold"" so that we can convert futon to a couch. Cover is too small after washing (not ""stretchy"")."
2906,3,"Looks nice, but not durable. It's basically two futon chairs connected, but the attachment that connects the two not made right. It has one bar of flat iron with one screw on each side. It does not last long. When we moved the futon it was hard to keep the two pieces together. Cheep wood got eroded can't screw it back. We only got 3 months of use out of it."
2907,2,A number of things were wrong except the product. The product was beautiful and tangible and cheap for what it was. what wasn't cool was UPS leaving at the bottom of my stairs of my apartment building. for me to Move up the stairs myself. then Amazon wanted me to negotiate the terms of the delivery with my local UPS while still charging me shipping. that's enough for me to be out on every order that I ever made and ever would make.
2908,3,"So I've had this for a few weeks, and don't get me wrong the packaging was great, the comfort level is a 5 out of 10. But this thing gives me a lot of itchy/ irritant things to my skin. I can't sit or sleep on it without itching. I think it has something to do with the material or chemicals on this material. Anywho this is garbage. I'm a pretty clean person, also a neat freak so I think this should be inspected before selling."
2909,3,Luckily I only sit on the thing for rare occasions as I don't think it would hold up and you can only sit two people...the person in the middle with 3 gets a rock hard support crossmember to sit on. its also too small to sleep on if you are over 5 foot 8. Lastly the construction will not hold up to kids or dogs playing...its very flimsy. I'd return it if it wasn't so big. Junk.
2910,3,Bought this from the marketplace. Seller contacted me after completing the purchase they would be back ordered for at least 2-3 months which I didn’t like but agreed to. Soon afterwards I began to receive daily emails telling me my order would not be fulfilled. Eventually I called and learned the vendor cancelled and failed to fulfil the order. The price had drastically increased recently so I suspect it was due to this but I’m very hesitant now to ever trust any items from a marketplace seller moving forward due to this awful experience.
2911,3,"Finally in our new home, so we were excited to set up the futon. Unfortunately it would be better suited for children under the age of 10. My 17 year old son is almost 6 feet tall and his legs dangle over it. It would be very nice if it were adult size. * barely 6 months later and it completely fell apart. Horrible purcase and a huge waste of money for a single mom on a buget. Too bad since the majority of the thing that I purchased on Amazon have been awesome. Oh well."
2912,1,"Too hard, not tall enough to sit comfortably as a couch or chair. Too short to lie down on. The photo should show this thing in a room setting. It is more like seating for an Asian restaurant. I goof sometimes. Now I lost storage underneath and it's too short for my inflatable mattress. My military cot is more sofa size. This is not sofa size even for someone who is not very big. Back aches, legs ache, HEIGHT for average female is mid-calf length. That is ridiculous. Do NOT buy furniture unless it is pictured in a room and pay attention to measurements. This is only for a child cuz it's too small for even a teenager and forget teenage boys. They'd hang off the end. TOO SMALL for Twin Size Bedding. So, I need to buy child size bedding? I'm sliding off of this right now while on my laptop. My legs are sliding down to the floor. Sliding off. This product should cost half this amount. Its half a couch/bed."
2913,1,"This was purchased for my ""she shed."" My ass hurts when sitting on it, u feel every thing inside the""cushions."" I've already had to re.staple the bottom fabric back on the futon. Wouldn't recommended for sitting more than 15-30 mins at a time. I wouldn't recommend lying down on it unless u have a lot of blankets on the bottom."
2914,3,"This is the worst couch (futon) I have ever sat on.I had 2 back surgeries over 5 years ago, for a pinched sciatic nerve. The second surgery was successful. I have been diligent in physical rehab; as well as cautious in my posture, and sleeping and sitting furniture. I am just furnishing my home on a budget. I planned on using this futon as both a couch and a place for overnight guests to sleep. I unboxed it and, it is pretty and easily put together. I sat on it overall...probably 3 hours. It was uncomfortable, but I thought maybe it just took some getting used to. I woke up the next day with horrible nerve pain shooting through my leg. It has been 2 days now and I am still in bed; in pain. Worst purchase I've ever made. I tried contacting the company who made this for a refund or return. No reply after 3 days. I am kinda aggravated at the slow response."
2915,3,Terrible! Arrived with the back broken and not able to stay up so not able to use as a couch (which is why we bought it). The company was nice and allowed us to return it however the box had arrived torn and and it didn't last through trying to open it so we had no way of shipping it back. So we are stuck with a flat futon that we have no use for. It was at least pretty looking (in color and design). I wish it would have worked!
2916,3,"I had somewhat low expectations and figured things couldn't be that bad, and based the pictures of the cushions shown in both the product description and customer reviews, I figured I'd end up with something that was at least acceptable. Unfortunately, that just wasn't the case. For starters, I ordered one color but received another. I wouldn't have even minded the color discrepancy if this were an acceptable product--but it just isn't, not even close. The cushions are half as full/filled than the mattresses shown in the pictures. I know it says it may take a few days to decompress, but I just don't see that happening based on the material--it's a horribly thin blend that will never puff up and actually support your bum or back. After several hours and shaking things out, the specified thickness of the cushion/mattress is nowhere near 5""-6"" -it's more like 3"" when undisturbed (Pictures 1 & 3), and instantly flattened into 1"" if actually put any weight/pressure on it (Picture 2). If you actually try and lean back, the pillows go right through the frame (Pic 4), and the corner--the best spot--is completely without support or closure since the two ends don't meet and there's a couple inches gap that just doesn't support anything based on the thinness of the cushion (Pic 5). It's like tossing a weighted blanked over a raw wood/metal bed frame and calling it a futon. Honestly, as soon as I looked at this thing and sat down on it, I started laughing like Steve Allen's laughing fit (google/youtube it) because I couldn't believe how bad it was. Lol. The fact that I purchased the protection plan for this garbage made me laugh even more as I slowly realized this is the most regrettable purchase I have ever made on Amazon for $300. I instantly knew I'd never get comfortable with this mistake and it's going to be such a hassle to return even with the seller's cooperation because now there's this...thing...in my apartment...that I'm not sure what to do with."
2917,1,This futon is not worth the money. Stay away from this one.Bought this to replace the small couch in my RV. It turned out to be pretty much a piece of junk. The mattress is so thin you can feel the boards when you sit on it. It is so low you feel like you are sitting on the floor. The back pillows were very difficult to get into the small covers they sent with them.Tried to return it to the dealer but was just outside the 30 day return window so it will go to the Salvation Army. Bought a great futon to replace it from Walmart for $119. Expensive lesson learned.
2918,3,"I have to wonder who these people are who say this thing is ""comfy""!! It is the most UNCOMFORTABLE piece of junk I have ever wasted $300 on. The ""mattress"" is so thin you can feel the wood slats right through it. It is HARD and impossible to even sit on, much less sleep on with any reasonable semblance of comfort. The picture is very deceptive and makes it look very cushy and comfortable - but it surely is not. It was also difficult to put together since the holes don't line up. It would be impossible for me to disassemble and repack this thing for shipping since I have no one to help me, otherwise I would send it back in a minute (the mattress is extraordinarily heavy). I suppose that is what the seller counts on. I cannot imagine why anyone would want this awful thing unless you want to be sure your visiting relatives will not stay for more than one night - or they may not stay at all if they sit on it first. (I suppose in that case it is worth its weight in gold.) I have shopped with Amazon for years and I have never been disappointed, so this is a first for me. Hardly ""Best Futon Lounger."" I have a few suggestions for a new description title ...."
2919,3,"The frame is decent but the pillows and main cushion are very poor quality. The description states 80% blended cotton and 20% polyester fill, they mean cut up bits of a 1"" memory foam topper sandwiched between two layers of recycled cotton (picture attached). The cushions it came with a flimsy, and if you lean back on them, you feel the bar digging into your back. I actually had to spend an additional $75 to get a 5.5"" memory foam twin xl mattress to replace the garbage mattress this came with, and also had to purchase a memory topper to create new cushions that actually supported my back in addition to the ones included. This is a $150 couch not worth the $349."
2920,1,"I'm always intrigued how manufacturers will modify their images so their product looks better than it really is. The futon mattress is less than HALF the thickness shown. If you like the feel of hard boards under your butt, then buy this lounger. Plus, if it were any lower, it would be below ground. Recommending you not look at the pretty 5 stars and get real: don't buy this product. Ridiculous."
2921,1,This is very cheaply made its way to small when layed down maybe a 5 year old could sleep on it.. it's very uncomfortable. We've had it for 4 days and the legs have already broke off. We have contacted them to return it but we were told we have to pay to have it shiped back and pay a 50% restocking fee. Im truly disappointed strongly do not recommend this product.
2922,3,"The sofa looks ok. If you have a little flexibility, pay more to ensure quality. Got mine already damaged when it shipped - there was already a tear. My sofa doesn’t even stand because they sent me these without the front legs and was asked to go to a hardware store and find the missing parts on my own. It would have been an ‘acceptable’ sofa, might look good for a year or so. A little too low and the armrests are a bit weird. I can’t comment on the comfort when sitting or laying on it since it’s not really set up yet to be sat on (without the legs in the package). Texture feels a little uncomfortable and might need the help of a throw or a rug to make it feel more cozy."
2923,3,"When I received this sofa one of the wholes where a leg was suppose to we screwed on was broken and defective. Since I didn't want to have the bother of returning a whole sofa I took it upon myself to glue the leg back into the sofa. Everything was fine up until today I sat on the sofa and it collapsed because a different leg of the sofa had busted out. I'm not a very heavy person, I weigh 135lbs so this should not have happened. The sofa came defective but now its completely useless. I've had it less than 6 month and im terribly disappointed with the quality."
2924,3,"Made cheaply, following manufacturer instructions, the brackets that convert the couch to a bed have broke.Reading the other reviews, it would be more of a pain to repackage and send back and pay a restocking fee. Instead I will engineer something myself to make this futon work. You do get what you pay for, unfortunately."
2925,3,I bought it and thought it would be good addition to my room. Nope. The back leg broke off the second I sat on that side. When the futon is in the upright position and the cup holder is down it sqeezes you. In the bed position it is the size of a twin bed. The back rest goes lower than the seat section so it is uncomfortable. Sitting on it normal it feels fine. But when I try to change it into a bed or vise verse it feels like a can break if I push or pull too hard. All I can say is you get what you pay for.
2926,3,"When I bought this I saw words like Japanese,futon and most importantly eco and didn’t give a second thought that this could an unsafe product. My roommate developed a skin condition when I let her borrow it and she dug into their ani bacterial and anti mite compound. On the public open database pubchem, she found this under the main ingredient -...IT ACTS AS STRONG SKIN, EYE & UPPER RESP TRACT IRRITANT.I would like to return it but I’m outside the return windo so 140.00 down the toilet."
2927,3,Ordered 2 for when friends come over and have a place to sleep. I had high expectations based off of the pictures and reviews but I was sadly mistaken. I payed the mattress on padded carpet and laying on it feels no different than sleeping on the carpet itself. I even layered 2 on top of each other and you can instantly feel your back and pelvis hit the floor. Literally 0 support. Perfect for giving your guests back pain.
2928,3,"Even after a day or two of airing out this shiki was barely 2 inches. Closer to a mattress topper/pad, and for the price you can do so much better. Instant return.Good to note ""full"" size is not American standard. This was at least 10in longer then a traditional US full size bed."
2929,2,"I had high expectations for this futon bed. I previously had the D&D brand futon bed and it was perfect. I decided that I wanted to try a little more ""high end"" or ""higher quality"" futon bed. This futon bed is double the price of the D&D futon bed yet it was basically like sleeping on top of a pillow topper alone. It wasn't 3 inches maybe like 1.5-2 inches at the most. It wasn't comfortable at all. I decided to return it right away and purchase the D&D japanese futon again which I've purchased 3 times already. It's a shame, I was really excited about this one but I guess more expensive doesn't always mean better."
2930,3,"Its not the depth of this futon that's lacking, so much as the density. It arrived faster than expected, in a lighter and smaller box than expected. After unboxing it and letting it air out for a few days before first use, I was underwhelmed with its lack of support, or even presence.I said, ""Well maybe once the frame arrives, it will mature a little.""Time passes. The frame arrives. Time passes. I finally get it put together.""Wow. No this is entirely unsuitable.""My 12 year old walks in the room, ""Hey, can I try the new futon?"" (Sure, Buddy!)""This is really uncomfortable. Can I take the X-box upstairs and play on the floor?""I'm afraid this one has to go back.Would serve as a pillow topper nicely."
2931,1,Extremely disappointed. After putting this thing together the smell that came out of the couch is unbearable. It smells like it was dipped in fish oil. I’ve been trying to spray it with all different fabric spray is to mask the smell. It hasn’t been helping. Customer service if you’re listening something happened at your factory and somebody spilled a whole bunch of fish puke all over your stuff. Very very disappointed. Do not buy unless you want your room to smell like stale fish.
2932,3,"Coulda sworn I made a review already.Look, you're probably like me right now, reading the bad review to figure if it's something you can deal with...that the pros will outweigh the cons...My couch broke months ago and I just bought it in February. THERE WERE MISSING SCREWS IN THE PARTS PUT TOGETHER BY THE FACTORY. all it took was for somebody to use the arm of the couch to get up and it completely fell off.There are 4 screws to be had on each side of the arm brackets. One side had 4. The other had 1. ONE. 8 HOLES, 5 SCREWS. if you're gonna screw people over, at least separate the screws into an even division, dumb fcks. Barely anything was keeping the bracket onto the one side of the arm. That is not user error. That's a manufacturing error, so I expected to get some sympathy. Nope. It was pretty much ""too bad, the 30 day warranty ended"" or whatever bullshit they spewed.And if you notice, a good chunk of their bad reviews start RIGHT after I bought mine, of course. I woulda have never bought it. Please. There's gotta be a cheaper couch at Walmart u can get.Besides that, I really did love the couch at first. Perfect for our tiny apartment, my favorite color blue, wAsnt as low to the floor as everybody with the negative reviews said.As you'll see in the pictures, there's 4 puncture holes in one side of the couch and 1 on the other. That was supposed to be already put together by the manufacturer. Nothing to do with user malfunction. Probably better off super gluing it."
2933,1,"This couch is probably ok for decoration, but NOT for laying or sitting. Feels like an absolute brick when you sit on it. Which is bananas because it looks soooo comfortable.The design is interesting and I respect the engineers that came up with it.I returned this item and had to take it to the UPS store myself, they would not have someone pick it up. So yea I had it sticking out of the trunk of my Toyota Camry as I drove down the highway. Buy at own risk."
2934,3,"It looks beautiful and I was so happy about the purchase, until 2 months later when the furniture started fraying and the seller denied to fix it.I contacted Amazon, which told me I would get a refund as soon as I returned the futton. Today, I received an e-mail saying that the furniture was received and they would refund me partially. However, Amazon agreed to give me a full refund. I had to start a type of A to Z claim (for the second time) to ask for my full refund. I will update this review later when I get an answer.I knew that would be a small piece of furniture and not comfortable. But a piece of furniture is supposed to last more than 2 months."
2935,1,"Poor quality futon. It's extremely uncomfortable to sit or sleep on. I'm not a big guy, and I find it too small to even sit comfortably on. You need to sit upright the whole time, since there's no room to slouch a bit.Also if you change it into it's sleeping mode, there's a giant metal lump in the center that pokes out and makes it really uncomfortable to sleep on.I do not recommend buying this at all."
2936,2,"Material is fine, but I don't know how this is supposed to be a full size cover. It is way too big. Not even close. It just sags everywhere. I have an old one that fits like a glove that was made by Designs by Ling in Texas. I ordered another one of those. Lesson learned."
2937,3,"There are many color choices in the little swatches to the right, but we cannot see how they correspond to the color names. This might be alright for red or blue, but not for the several brown shades offered. one has to go by the name of the color, which is not specific enough. I bought this for a gift, and the recipient must return it because the color is way off. Also, although they put it on a full size mattress (not a thin typical futon mattress) it was large and wrinkly."
2938,3,"I am sure I would have loved this futon cover if the color of the product was the one on the label and on the product description. I ordered the sage but received a very dark olive one. Would try again, but it looks like a packaging error. I am afraid I would get another dark olive one again."
2939,3,"This futon cover fits very well and shipped very quickly, but there is no color on their color chart that corresponds to the cover that I received. I assumed the ""purple"" was the winey color on the bottom right, almost closer to burgundy than a true purple. What I received was an electric purple, very similar to the color of grape Kool-Aid. It's an awful color, very tough to match, and I would never have chosen it had it been clear what the color I was ordering actually looked like."
2940,3,"Really disappointed with this product - fabric feels like the cheap covering on an inflatable air mattress. The pattern appears darker in the photo, but unless you are super close it just looks gray. Pattern is also only on one side - so if you like to rotate your futon you will have to take the cover off to flip it. Hope Amazon will accept a return."
2941,3,"Jun 3rd.It's not bad. The couch aspect of it is a little uncomfortable once you set it right. But the bedding is amazing I sleep like a million bucks, so it's for the $45 dollars is pretty good until I can afford a futon couch for the time being, but we'll worth the money.4 out of 5.Aug 6thThe first few several weeks was okay...up until I had bad Phantom shoulder pains and barely could turn my head. Every time I get up it was a struggle, if felt like I was stabbed repeatedly and then snapped my neck while I was sleeping. Lucky for me, I solved that problem by adding more my two extra blankets as pillows. Now I got sciatica for two weeks... On top of that, the couch had started to deflate constantly just recently, now because I can't find the source of the leak and kept putting air in it and letting bit do it's thing, there is now a hole were I sit that popped open this morning. I only got 2 months of rest on it but knew I would eventually get something better, but not like this.1 out 5."
2942,3,"Its a great couch, but its not for extended use, my husband and I sink to one side if its just one of us. We like it, its very comfortable, and the roll-out option is great.Ok, so this is my edit. I normally do not change my reviews and this is probably only my second one where I am very unhappy. After having this for a little over a month, the middle peice is deflated, there is something wrong with the peice you put the air into because thats where the air is leaking from. We were happy up until this point and now I wish I would have read the reviews better because I wouldnt have bought this!"
2943,3,"This was delivered to me and when I got it, I instantly took it out of the box and aired it up. I made sure to be gentle with it because I camp a lot with air mattresses and how easily they can tear just dragging it or too much air inside. Well, after it was done filling up, I could literally hear air escaping through out the entire couch. Sat on it and defeated in 2 minutes. There were holes all over the thing right out of the box. Not sure what's up with that but I was so excited for it. Other than terrible manufacturing, it was awesome. Roomy and large."
2944,3,"It worked well for about 3 weeks. The first time I deflated and then went to use it again however, it mysteriously sprang a leak which in turn caused it to blow the seam on the top mattress. This makes the couch/ bed impossible to sleep on. Within minutes, the couch ""frame"" started leaking also. I have looked everywhere for a leak and have came to the conclusion this is just a really lovely made product for not so cheap of a price. If you plan to use it once and throw it away, this will work perfect. If you want to waste money because you have too much of it laying around, again, great. This is the couch for you. If you're looking for value or a deal, stay away. Looks great and feels like it's decent quality til you actually need to use it. I am 4""10 and 105 lbs, so no way I over exceeded the weight capacity on it. Save the time and money and just buy a Coleman cot with mattress and 2 inch memory foam topper. It sleeps a lot better and you don't have to worry about waking up on the floor. The Intex couch bed is a lot like their self leveling pools. It seems like a good idea until you're stuck with it."
2945,1,Buyers beware. Intex does not back this product at all even for manufacturing defects. Asked for a supervisor to contact me to straighten out this matter to no avail no contact was made. My advice to stay away from all intex products. A company who doesn't stand behind their product for sure won't stand with their customers.
2946,3,"Received it timely and the cushion cover looks nice like picture. However, the mattress inside is not actually a mattress -- it's some kind of weird ""stuffing"". Smells funny & looks like some type of hay or lawn debris? And now that our son's been sitting on it a month+, it's hard as a rock. Again, not really a mattress at all - at least by U.S. standards. We would have returned it for sure, but didn't realize amazon return policy is only within 30 days of purchase. We had just moved in and didn't even get it set up until we had it a couple weeks. ugh."
2947,3,"arrived with multiple darker-brown stains - had a strange smell overall and was not pleasant to sit on due to the smell and stains. had to buy a cover for it in order to sit on it comfortably. I am extremely disappointed in this product and would like to return it. Unfortunately, I live in NY and this is very large to walk to the nearest post office. Would appreciate if Epic Furnishings did something to compensate for this inconvenience and overall disappointment in their product.."
2948,3,"This literally is the worse mattress I've ever owned and slept on. Within just a few months the inner filling shifted so much that it feels like my partner and I are sleeping on mountain ranges. There are big ridges going through the mattress and even bigger dips. We've flipped the mattress so many times to try and even things out but as the days went by it got worse and worse causing us both bad pain in our bodies. From headaches to lower back pain and everything in between. While I like the idea of the filling being cotton, there's seems to be nothing in place that prevents it from shifting around. A total waste of money."
2949,3,"mattress is four inches at best, but was impossible to return. fedex ground was able to drop it off, but ups was not able to come down the driveway to pick it up. even if they could have, the tissue strength cardboard box was destroyed upon opening and there was no way a single person could compress and roll the thing back into the original bag. the return requires original packaging. i rarely review, but months later, the mattress contents shift and i can feel the futon frame through it. i regret every dollar spent."
2950,1,"I wish there was a 0 rating possible. This futon is a bad alternative for a mattress. I placed it on my platform bed and slept on it for two hours, my back was not feeling all that good. I then placed it on the floor. My friend and I slept on it to get up with a terrible feeling back in the morning. Highly disappointed with this product. This is one of the very few times I am writing up a review about a product, don't want anybody else to face the same problem."
2951,3,doesn't accurately fit my chair. I knew that buying it I just wanted a cover for my leather chair sticking against my skin. the tag designed to hold the strap to the chair broke almost instantly. made of very poor quality cloth and stitched terribly it ripped as soon as I snagged the strap trying to adjust it. All in all i had to restitch and fabricate the sheet myself to fit the chair. Should have just bought the cloth myself.
2952,3,"I really like this cover. I bought three different ones, oversized sofa, loveseat, and the recliner. Everyone but the recliner stays clipped and in place. The recliner clip falls off, strap comes off, etc. I think the loops to hold in place are not positioned properly. I wish I sent it back, but kept hoping things would get better. Right now there's no strap holding it because it doesn't go across and the metal piece just twists and falls off. Please correct this problem. This could be a good product."
2953,3,"Not only do I have to reearrange the couch cover daily (it moves every time someone sits on it so it would be a daily chore getting it to lay flat and nice on my couch), the loops that keep the straps in place broke after 1 year of use. Now I have to either take this broken one into a tailor to get it fixed or I can buy a different, more reliable brand of couch cover."
2954,1,I would give these 0 stars if I could. Even after measuring and making sure they would fit my furniture they only half do. They cover the furniture as advertised but the cheap elastic strap that is supposed to hold them in place doesn't work. The hooks metal hooks that connect through the cloth loops slip and constantly move. Not to mention I have it let all the way out to give it as much slack as possible. The craftsmanship is horrible and the loops have already started ripping apart even though no one actually uses this furniture other than our dog. If you want something that looks alright as long as you don't use it then waste your money here!
2955,3,"I have two leather couches, so I ordered two of these. In the product photo, there's a kid & dog sitting on it and they look like they'd be fantastic. HA! Threw them on my couches, turned my back and POOF, they were already jacked up. My dog hopped up and the entire back (held on by an elastic band around the back side of the couch) slipped out and fell down. The husband tried to tighten the band up, but it's stretchy... Duh, not going to get tight enough to hold the back in place. Oh well, we went for plan B. Lets tuck the back and sides into the couch to at least protect the seating surface. Even this is no match for a dog or person sitting on top - the entire cover slips, slides and looks like utter crap. I'd have been better off just throwing a $10 Walmart blanket over my couch and calling it a day. Can't send them back fast enough."
2956,3,"You may find some holes are 9"" from end and some are 10"" from end. Hopefully you will have all matching pairs. Measure and pair. I use wood glue on all dowels that I don't anticipate a need for deconstruction in the future. If you do that too, take them out and glue them afterward. Afterward when you see that it all fits. If you blow it, drilling and gluing is pretty simple. The three is only because fixing these errors in QC, I'm certain, is not too tough. Increment in price would work to re-coop costs from QC upgrade. And, BTW, I loved the wood and with a week of use it appears solid.After two weeks with it here are my recommendations. Take three or maybe four phone books from a large metro area. Place them in a stack on the floor and have a seat. Now, stand from your seated position. Also, get a very firm futon that won't compress or plan on some more platform. I'm going to use 1/4"" plywood for a full cover."
2957,1,"This futon frame sits much too low on the floor, lower than most platform beds even, thus making it difficult for people to get up off of it. This is honestly the worst Amazon purchase I have ever made. Don't make the mistake I did in selecting this."
2958,3,I loathe this frame and look forward to one day setting it on fire. First off the drill holes did not line up so we had to buy an additional drill bit to make our own holes. The frame is very squeaky and creaky. Its very difficult to move from bed to couch position and while a bit less difficult the other way it is still quite cumbersome. In couch position it can only be set into the most reclined of the four different settings because it doesn't line up to fit the other options. Even in the reclined position only the left side actually fits into the grooves the other side can only hover near it. I did what I had to do by purchasing this and I knew it wasn't going to be the best frame but its barely even functional.
2959,1,"I was going to give 5 stars until the last screw gave me trouble and wasn't go in. I hurt my hand and the screw is still half way out won't go in. obviously I can't put my mattress on with it. It's insane! The frame actually take more space once built and doesn't save much space either. Other than that, it's as advertised and it works. For your sanity if you really have to buy this one, get an electric screw driver other than your bare hands!"
2960,3,What a mistake. My daughter tried to assemble the frame but it was missing some pre-drilled holes. Can only get a refund if we return this large and heavy product. So much for buying furniture online.
2961,2,"Plastic tabs poke at you while you try to sleep, heavy and hard to fold up when using as seat or couch. Can feel the springs under you while trying to sleep. I'm able to deal with all the above...But within 5 months a spring broke and started poking through. Flipped it over and will use it until it dies, but will never buy again.Edit: I was wrong, I had forgotten that the other side was even worse and I could feel every spring digging into me that much more. Ordered a memory foam and I plan to avoid the name Serta completely from now on."
2962,1,"I am using this as a bed until able to move into my new house. I found it to be quite firm, but I have not woke with a sore back or hip, thank goodness. I'd like to know how they expect this to fold into a sitting position? I'm in my sixties, and managed to finally fold the futon frame, but THERE'S NO WAY I can wrangle this to folding in half. I was going to use it in the new house for guests, but if I can't fold it, it's useless for any seating and if I wanted a full-time bed, I would have bought one! Very disappointed in this purchase as it is not multi-functional as stated. (Dropped it by a star when the cover ripped within a few months while attempting to fold into the seating position. I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MATTRESS).."
2963,3,"After several weeks of chemical smells (flame retardant, bug treatment, ??) emanating from this mattress after it was delivered in the winter, I thought I was home free. I was shocked when I started feeling the springs of the mattress after only 4 months. Now 6 months later, the mattress is barely usable and is painful to sit on. My last heavy spring mattress lasted about 13 years before I noticed internal spring issues. This one didn't last half a year.If I could return or get a refund, I would try. I don't usually write reviews or try to make returns. However, this product was horrible. Maybe it was defective? Cross your fingers and find out."
2964,1,"I have never been so disappointed and stuck with a purchase from amazon than with this mattress. I can not possibly pack it the way it was packed without some sort of air compressor so shipping it back is very costly. I am stuck with this and would like to save others the frustration and disappointment of spending their hard earned money on a product that is falling apart. Hope my review will deter others from buying this. What's wrong with it?1. The springs are sticking out of the sides and top of the mattress so much that besides sticking into my back, I am afraid they will rip the flimsy material in no time at all. I have attached the pictures to show it.2. It is falling apart at the seams. Literally. I have to sew the rips together and it was't even used yet. Shown in the pictures.3. There are random holes in the middle of the mattress of where the strings should have been. Looks like someone made a mistake by puncturing holes in the wrong place and decided to leave them there. (shown in my pictures) Who gives a damn about the customer? We'll eat it all up right?4. When you look at the mattress laying on the frame, it's all bunched up on one side and there is no way of evening it out. It looks horrible. Shown in my pictures.I don't normally post reviews, but like I said, this is the worst purchase I have made on Amazon. I feel like I threw money in the garbage. I am a small woman, so I can not just magically pack this thing back up, air seal it and fit it back into the box. I hope to save others the aggravation and disappointment."
2965,3,"Very fast delivery, and the mattress appeared new. It came wrapped up in plastic except the two ends of the roll. (Why wasn't it completely sealed?) One exposed corner of the mattress appeared to have been smeared with dirt or grease (possibly during transportation). I tried to scrub this off with detergent but the stain was stubborn.After unpacking the mattress, I found a 2 or 3 inch-long gash in the fabric, exposing the cotton stuffing inside. I'll see if I can return this.. Not pleased with this purchase...Edit: not able to return it because I was not able to stuff it back into the original packaging. The UPS guy wouldn't take it due to its size. Amazon gave me a ~15% discount (don't remember the exact amount)."
2966,1,"I ordered this futon cover because I thought it would be cute and there were lots of great reviews. However, when I received the cover, the fabric was really thin and was kind of like what you could get if you went down to Piece Goods or whatever. It looked really sloppy on the couch and had no structure. I made the mistake of thinking that if I washed it, it would bulk up a bit as some fabrics do. So, in my mind I was giving the seller another chance by washing it to see if it would look better. Nope. It still looked cheap and awful after washing and drying. I decided to return it.When I spend premium price on something, I expect the quality to match. If I wanted something I could make myself, I would just do that. This item was $40 more than what I bought at a local futon dealer. In comparison, the fabric from the futon dealer was thick and high quality and also made in the USA. I am super disappointed in the amount of money I am out on this transaction and I have NOTHING to show for it except frustration. Do not trust this seller. If you buy, beware."
2967,3,"We received the full-size futon cover and were pleased with the color and quality; however, it simply didn't fit. Our mattress is a DCG 8 inch mattress and the cover description states ""6 to 8 inches"". After wrestling with the cover and mattress for far too long, we put it back in the plastic bag only to notice a label that says ""5 inch"" (see photo). We hope DCG has an explanation."
2968,3,"The fabric is not colorfast. I had to blot a stain and now I have a spot where the grey is significantly lighter. The fit was fine and it looked good. I’ll have to flip the futon over and hope for no more mishaps!Update.... I washed the cover in cold wash, hung to dry as I didn’t want it to shrink. It has shrunk by at least 4”."
2969,3,"I love this so much and it looks amazing in the room. The color is a darker grey and the flowers are bright. Unfortunately, after only 3 weeks, it got a small stain from my little yorkie. No big deal, I used a damp rag and Woolite and blotted the spot. It came out, but after it dried, the spot is light grey and faded. I will just make that the ""bad side"" and flip it when company comes. Really disappointed and sad. It really brought the room together and now I just walk by it and frown. I will add a picture this evening."
2970,1,"These are thin covers. I ordered one for the loveseat and one for the full-size futon. The colors have faded and the gray in the background is so faded it looks like it is covered in dirt or dust. I had bought pillows and other items especially to go with the colors in these covers and I will have to throw the covers out now they are in such horrid condition. It is amazing to me to look at the picture and see how mine look now. This was after 1 wash. After owning 2 covers by this brand, I deliberately had searched for this brand again since they were thick and lasted so long. I am embarrassed how badly they look and frustrated I wasted my money on a brand I trusted and felt so good about. I had decorated my living room especially around the color scheme and now will have to search for something similar but definitely not this brand. I would not suggest buying these unless you never plan to wash them. They arrived beautiful but came out of the wash looking like trash. Almost like they were painted with watercolor and it washed out. Very disappointed :(."
2971,3,"Sorry, but this IS hot to sleep on. Not good in So. Nevada! It is also very slippery and although it stays on the bed, every time I move, the sheet over it slides and bunches. NOT comfortable at all. Very disappointing. Now I'm looking for another one to protect my new mattress, not cook me and one that lets the sheet stay in place when I move around. And yes, I am using older sheets that never have slid and bunched before."
2972,1,Waterproof my ass!! I had this in my camper under the bedcover just in case the camper got wet. Well it did and the mattress was soaked. Went right through the bed cover and the so called waterproof liner. Mold and mildew all over the bed. This is a piece of crap. I definitely do not recommend. The bad thing is I bought 2 and I still have 1 left that I certainly won't use.
2973,3,"Not waterproof! We have a ten pound dog that sometimes has small accidents and when we bought a bigger bed, we needed a new waterproof mattress pad. I wish I went with the old one we had bc this one did NOT protect our $1200 new mattress. A very small accident should not have gone through. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
2974,3,"This product isn't waterproof, period. That is a completely false claim. Two of them one on top of the other isn't even waterproof, water soaks right through to the next layer, which might be your mattress. I don't know how much liquid it's supposed to absorb, since that info isn't given, but it's not much. If I'm going to have to put a moving/storage bag on to protect the mattress, then this product isn't needed. I do feel ripped off due to the waterproof claim. Insanely expensive for something that doesn't do what it claims."
2975,1,"These are NOT Waterproof mattress protectors!!I It is false advertising that it is 100% waterproof!In fact these are NOT WATERPROOF AT ALL!!!I purchased X4 of these for use as a mattress protector for small children who are not yet potty trained and each morning the urine went right through the protector into the mattress. Complete waste of money and intended purpose for purchasing. Read some other reviews (wish I had before purchasing) which also state they found them NOT to be waterproof. Mattresses now have stains on them, wonderful. BOLD AND FALSE ADVERTISING!!!"
2976,3,"I bought one for our recliner and one for the couch... measurements were verified and everything. The straps are useless, they immediately wiggled out of the tabs. The things simply don't stay on, they constantly slide down and get pulled up out of the seat. They got marked up very quickly as well, within a day. We used them for a few days, then relegated them to the closet for when we have company. Waste of 70 bucks, should've gotten a different style."
2977,3,"If you have a thin sofa similar to the photo it would probably fit fine, but if you have a sofa that has any girth or thickness to its pillows it is too small. My sofa is a 70"" leather sofa as described in the acceptable dimensions, but it fit way too tight. Now the stitching has come undone in the loops an is pretty much worthless."
2978,3,"So far this slip over is very nice, thick and washed well. In the description it says it comes with a 2” strap, mine has no strap! I am disgusted because the main reason I close this brand was because of the strap! I have 2 large dogs and the hardest thing is keeping a slip cover in place. My old slip cover had holes and was getting old, I had it for 5 years. Another complaint with almost every slip cover is the pieces that go over the arms of the sofa are too short, my last one was great, unfortunately I don’t remember the brand."
2979,3,"Unfortunately it doesn't really matter how soft, easy to clean , or that it's water resistant. It only lasted about 3 days before I could no longer stand it and had to remove it from my loveseat. The back kept falling down and I had to readjust it every single time I sat down. Would work great on a sofa that no one sits on. The strap connects to the slipcover with a open hook so it kept coming off the hook so the strap was useless. I tried using heavy duty sheet straps but they eventually snapped off hitting me in the back of the head. It would be better if the back went all the way down and was able to strap to the bottom back of the couch. Very disappointed!!!"
2980,3,"My cat peed on this cover and the smell will not wash out!!! I’ve washed it twice already and the smell is still very prominent. This cover isn’t advertised as being waterproof, so I purchased waterproof pads to put underneath. The cover is not water resistant AT ALL.How is this a furniture cover to protect from pets if it absorbs smells that won’t wash out??These look and feel great ( navy color is beautiful) but I can’t even use mine anymore due to the smell that I am unable to wash out :(."
2981,2,Purchased in October. Just finished getting the room ready for guest and tired to put this cover on the mattress. I read and followed the directions and it seemed to be going fine putting the top half on. Then the side ripped out at the zipper when I tired to slide cover over the bottom half. Very disappointed I called Surefit directly and all they told me was it was a product defect. If I had purchased from they directly they would have replaced it not problem but since it's through Amazon they can't help me. Very disappointed. Would not purchase again.
2982,3,"It goes without saying that any given slipcover will never look as pictured on the package. Even a professional installation will not stand up to actual use. This one is no exception. Unless your futon mattress is within a 1/2 inch if the recommended width, the fit will be loose. It is easy to put on/take off because of the extra fabric.West Elm makes very nice futon covers that give a fairly good fit. They do not stand up to regular use by kiddos though.We have vowed not to invest in a nicer sofa until our little kids are rational enough to know, among other things, that you shouldn't wipe your drippy nose on the furniture. So we are keeping this cover because it was not very expensive, and I won't be heartbroken when we have to replace it in 6 months.The taupe is a bit more peachy than expected. The fabric is thinner than expected. These two aspects each knocked off a star."
2983,1,"I would not recommend this slipcover. The zipper is in the middle of the cover in order for it to be hidden, I guess. This causes the slipcover to be extremely difficult to put on the mattress. One has to fold the mattress lengthwise, which is very hard to do, pull the cover on one side, then try to put it on the other side while the mattress is still folded. In the process, the slipcover ripped. We had it for 10 minutes and it is now ruined. Ridiculous design."
2984,3,Beautiful color - bluish grey and soft and that's where it stops. The zipper is in the middle of the the cover instead of one of the sides which makes it sooooooo hard to put the futon in the cover. The person who designed this obviously doesn't know how heavy a futon is because it's frameless and difficult to manipulate. It took 3 of us to get the futon mattress in this cover - it shouldn't be this difficult. I've had other futon covers and all the zippers are on the side either top or bottom side I don't know what the designer was thinking when they decided to put it in the middle.
2985,1,"First let me say this cover is NOT easy to put on! My husband and I huffed and puffed for good 20 minutes until we figured it out and then managed to get it on the mattress. Because the zipper is on the back side of the cover, we had to flip the mattress multiple times and squeeze and fold it like contortionists. He thought I bought the wrong size, that's how improbable it seemed. And then I realized 2 things: it's more blue than grey and the fabric is rather crappy. By then the cover was already on and my husband refused to take it off - getting it off would have been as difficult as putting it on! So we ended it up keeping it out of desperation. Buy a different cover, save yourself the trouble."
2986,3,"This is the 2nd time I've ordered this movie from Amazon/Mila Technologies and once again it came without the Digital Copy insert that contains the transfer code, so I can't use the Digital Copy. It's really too bad, since I've been trying to get this for my son and wanted to use the digital copy for our iPad when traveling."
2987,3,"I bought 2 copies of Avatar special edition...one for me one for my sister...and I returned mine, due to scratches that were there when opened and interrupted the movie, completely freezing it at times! My sister had the same errors on her DVDs(less severe).The replacement copy I was sent also had scratches that cause skipping...that's 3 badly handled DVD's. I think its the DVD designers fault...since the DVD is encased in an envelope slide out (where it can slide around). They were very small scratches, like sand or dirt had gotten stuck in there and rubbed against the DVD 100 times, most were the size of about this - .It was really disappointing.The packaging was really pretty.It doesn't do its job of protecting the DVD.Id rather durability and proper working order more than aesthetic appeal ...Please!All three would be proper :)."
2988,3,"I bought this in 3D Blue-ray and 3D function would absolutely not work. I tried it on 2 different blue-ray players with no luck. It has a Menu in the movie set up screen where you have to choose between 3D and 2D and that choice function wouldn't work and the movie just starts in 2D no matter what. It is infuriating and was an absolute waste of my money as I bought this solely for the 3D effect to watch on our projector. The outer case of this movie arrived with a corner shattered. Both discs seem to be undamaged, so the 3D issue must be due to this being some kind of knock-off."
2989,3,I'm not sure what the deal is with Disney these days but every DVD disk I have purchased from them in the past year simply won't play on my 6 month old DVD player ... nor will they play 'properly' on any of my computers... On the computers some will play but only intermittently... or seem to have file cache issues that wont smooth out... or audio/video sync issues or some other something or other... My neighbor next door has a DVD player of a different manufacture... won't play on that DVD player either... It's as if they are trying to discourage the purchase of their products in the DVD format... Imagine that... your selling a product to discourage people from buying your products... Wow! What is that... Anti-Sales you guys are doing over there? You Disney guys get stupider every time I read something about you... poor Walt is rolling over in his grave... I bet his undertakers are wondering why his grave is freshly plowed up every morning by 6am... LOL!
2990,2,So disappointed! Came all the way out of town without internet or anything. Bought a few DVDs for my daughter. And thought amazon why sell something that doesn’t work. Maybe gently used but not something totally skipping and causing havoc. We are very disappointed there is a large scratch across the DVD and it’s has skipped 5 times in under 10 minutes. Completely stopping and not playing. We will be sending this back as soon as we are back in town.
2991,2,"Originally I gave the ""ForTheLoveOfGame"" 5 stars because of their extremely good handling of the DVD which didn't work in my players. I had thought it was due to it being a different country code (never really resolved that issue). I was able to return it and get my money back and everything was great. About a month later one of their customer service reps emailed me to find out what the issue with the movie was (even though I had already mentioned it). I did not have a problem with explaining it...BUT...That rep wouldn't let it go; he/she kept writing me back trying to get to the bottom of it and started blaming my DVD systems (PS3, 3D LG Blue Ray Player, etc). Basically making it out like I should have gotten a new player just to be able to play the one DVD which wouldn't work in my system.I didn't return a broken or scratched DVD which I was at fault of destroying.The rep also didn't realize I had already returned it a few weeks prior when I (hopefully) made him/her feel like an idiot for the failed interrogation of my implied negligence. I was told to go ahead and return it; which I said I already had a few weeks prior and had been refunded already.I said before I would purchase from ""ForTheLoveOfGame"" if I can be assured the DVD had the right country code but now it's not worth it."
2992,1,"Ok, buyers beware...I purchased this movie NEW only to receive a USED one. The dvd came packaged like it hadn't been opened, but once I put the bluray into the player it asked me if I wanted to start where I left off. Also, the bluray had been sliding around in the case for who knows how long. To top it all off, it still had the code for the digital copy inside...Went to put the code in to receive it and it had already been used! One more thing...I flipped the case over and on the back ""made in mexico"" had been printed on it, don't have that on any of my other movies cases. Needless to say, I am VERY unhappy with this purchase."
2993,3,One star for not embedding the wakanda language that they speak!The movie is great and i do not wish for amazon to take away the kovie and reimburse me unless you guys release and updated movie with the subtitles other than that its a waste of $20 because you do lose some of the plot since we dont know what they are sating <U+0001F44E>.
2994,3,"Just like everyone else, i have no idea why there are no subtitles for the Xhosa scenes. I didn't see this in the theater, so I can't say they were included when released theatrically, but the consensus seems to be that they were included. Why and how this happened I can't say, but because I never saw this with the subtitles included, I have no idea what is going on. I am hoping this will be corrected."
2995,3,"*Star rating only for failure of bonus features to play* Although this title is available ""free"" with Prime, I paid to rent for the bonus content. Unfortunately, once the credists started, there was a frame for renting another title on the screen, and rewind, fast-forward & pause were non-functional. Eventually the bonus features ""froze"" during playback, and despite repeated attempts, I was unable to finish the bonus features, and due to the fact that none of the controls worked once the credits started, I have no idea how much.The $4 rental was a waste for ~10 min of bonus material most likely available with other titles. Very disappointed."
2996,3,"Was a good purchase until Amazon discontinued their digital download service. Now, if some tragedy strikes and I lose my downloaded copy I won't be able to watch this on my personal media player anymore, which would make them completely useless to me as Amazon's online media service is not capable of playing the movies in the medium I bought this for."
2997,3,"As for the product, I watched the blu-ray once (bought in 2008). Recently I put it in my player and it did not play (in 2016). It did not play on my computer's Blu-ray drive either. Reading online, a number of early Lionsgate blu-ray releases fail after a bit with how they were made (newer discs may not be an issue). Guess my disc was one of them but this movie is not worth purchasing again. And I have a few other Lionsgate blu-ray discs that I bought in 2008-2009 and I'm wondering if the same will happen to them."
2998,3,"I like how the game transformed from being racist and sexist to more diverse- more people of color and equal amount of women (considering that Jess is a female) - this is an achievement, even though I don’t understand overly-cartoonish characters,but Hasbro also re-modeled the board. The retailers keep advertising a classic 3-row board, which actually has been discontinued and Hasbro switched to a 4-rows version, also SMALLER, which I find more difficult for a child. Classic version had 3 rows. Why did Hasbro need to fix something that wasn’t broken? The seller also needs to update the pictures, because what is pictures is not what you’re getting.Can Hasbro just keep the quality and artwork but just add diversion? That’d be great."
2999,2,"I used to love to play this game when I was a kid, so I ordered it to play with my own kids. I just received it today, and I already dislike it and am very disappointed. The first issue is the face cards and the fact that I had to put them in the holders. Then to top it off, they constantly slide out! It’s really annoying and I just don’t get why they made it like that, the original version didn’t have this issue at all. My other complaint, like others have mentioned, is the way they have portrayed the minorities. I’m glad they added more women and diversity, but they went about it all wrong. The black characters are very unrealistic and to be frank, pretty offensive the way they are portrayed. I’m really disappointed in the remake, if I knew about either of these issues prior, I wouldn’t have supported the company by buying this product. I’d actually rather have the old version. Very disappointed and frustrated. They’ve taken a great game and childhood memory I wanted to share with my kids, and essentially ruined it. My son is excited to play it, he loves board games, but it really just gets me more and more frustrated and angry the more we play with it. Hands down worst purchase from Amazon."
3000,3,"I ordered this game for my ESL students to help them practice speaking. I remember the original version having next to no women, so I was glad to see an updated version of the game. Yes, this new version actually has equal numbers of men and women, but the fact of the matter is that the African-American faces are so grotesquely caricatured that I feel as though I have traveled back in time. It is unbelievable that a game I purchased in 2018 has a drawing of a minstrel show character as one of the people. Either I am going to draw new faces for all the characters myself, find new face cards, or throw the whole game out entirely. I cannot in good conscience recommend this game for anyone, and I strongly suggest that the creators reconsider their whole framework for what is acceptable. Unbelievable."
3001,1,"I was VERY disappointed with this particular model of the Guess Who? game because the cartoon-like faces are not the same as the more realistic faces in my friends’ games. I would not have purchased this game if I had known this model was different. The cartoon-like faces in this particular model have 5 different shades of skin tone. It is difficult to distinguish one face from another. Also, one of the faces looks like a “black face”. This particular model is racist!!"
3002,3,"LOVED this game as a child and was so delighted to share this beloved childhood memory with my seven year old daughter. Unfortunately, this memory has been soured by the characterization of African-Americans in this game which is very racist in it's portrayal from the oversized sterotypical big lips and noses. My seven year old blurted this out before I could mention anything about this when we opened the game. As an African-American family, this was not humorous at all and very disappointing to see. We play board games as a family and this one is one that we will not be subscribing too as it is forever tarnished. Shame on the designer and the company for approving these ""characters."""
3003,3,"I admit, I picked it because I needed ""The Game of Life"" for teaching my Sociology class, so I picked the least expensive. Attempting to play it and utilize it for a lesson on Social Stratification (the various income levels), I was completely flabbergasted by the action card scenarios, currency denominations, and simply the utter lack of reality.Comparing it to an older version of the game, it is an entirely different game.In attempting to be frugal on a teacher's salary, I will now need to purchase/create new versions of currency, careers, homes, etc. The only usable parts is the spinner & tokens."
3004,3,"This game just hands out money at almost every space. I know it's just a game, but the players receive 30k for going on trips and then gets more money for them at retirement. And players pay for almost nothing so money just accumulates like crazy. No real challenges. I can see the appeal that it's so easy, no one is disappointed, but I think it will lose its interest as the outcome is the same everytime... everyone has tons of money and big families and retires rich! : )."
3005,1,"I ordered this version of the game thinking it was just like the one I played as a child—but with the addition of pets! How wrong I was.Last year I bought Life Jr. to play with my grandkids. I excused some of the features of the game as part of its Junior designation: activity cards often involve singing, acting, or expressing yourself. These are all nice group activities, but they don’t connect with the activity of playing a board game to me.Tired of Life Jr., I bought the “regular” version only to find that the charades-like activities were part of this game as well. Also, it seemed as though all we accomplished was the exchange of money—it was constant ... and boring. It’s just not fun with the changes to how players interact with the game.If you loved the original Game of Life, pay more for the classic version—you’ll be disappointed by this one, I can almost promise."
3006,3,"Bought this for my Husband as a Christmas gift. We finally pulled it out to play and it was just terrible. The gameplay has been changed so much and there is really no challenge to the game. The entire game, between the two of us, we only had 3 cards that required us to pay the bank or another player. The rest of the time playing was spent collecting money every turn. We even re-read the rules multiple times to be sure we were playing it right.On top of that, the spinner does not spin well at all. We were so disappointed all around with this game."
3007,3,"This game is trash. It came to my house sealed and when we finally got through setting it up, we realized it was shipped without any money included. How on earth do you mass produce something as large scale as a board game and forget to include the most important part other than the board itself? The board is also cheaply made with pieces so small even superman couldn't see them. Honestly this game stinks out loud. To make this worse it all happened on Valentine's day. I was going to let my wife win for once and score some brownie points but Hasbro had other plans. Sad."
3008,3,"If I could rate it a zero stars I would, this is NOT made with quality in mind. It is not like the connect 4 I grew up with, this is cheaply made thin and not sturdy. The bar on the bottom the slides is horrible, thin comes off the tracks. The rest of the game is just as cheaply made not the thicker sturdy material I was expecting. My boy would not understand getting a different one since Santa brought it so I can't really return it in hopes to getting an old model that is sturdy.Although the game itself is still fun."
3009,3,"Unfortunately a pretty cheaply made unit -- very flimsy, the chips are the perfect size for my 10 month old to put entirely in her mouth, and the pieces don't release easily from the game when you slide the bottom guard, so you have to rock it and wiggle the last few pieces out. I will keep looking for a better quality version of this classic game."
3010,1,"This game came with legs and a bottom slider that need to be twisted out of a plastic frame. The pieces didn't fit together well, and the bottom piece fell off immediately when my kids tried to use it. When they tried to snap it back on, the pieces broke off. Really, really junkie. I do not recommend which is too bad, because the game concept is nice."
3011,3,Just opened up the game and was very disappointed to find that there's no bottom blue piece to keep the chips from falling through!!! A big miss!!! Brand new game now has to go to the trash. What a waste! Unfortunately the return window is closed - I never thought I'd even have to check to make sure such a simple game has all the vital pieces. Pretty ridiculous.
3012,3,"I can't believe all these positive reviews. Their expectations must be frighteningly low. I've played connect 4 all of my life. Yes it's an awesome game. But opening this box was a slap in the face. Hasbro could not have made this thing any cheaper. There can't be more than 15 cents worth of raw material in there. I bet it costs Hasbro more to print the box than it does to produce the game. I tossed out my last connect four game because my son was too young for it, and it seemed like the parts were always laying around the house. Big mistake. The old one was well made and would have been durable for a lifetime. I didn't know they changed the construction. The one I bought recently is so cheap; I'm too embarrassed to have this thing out in front of adult company. The plastic has the strength, rigidity, thickness, and consistency you would expect to find in toys at the dollar store. This reeks of a CEO compromising a company's good reputation for increased profits. Hasbro revenues are $4.6 billion. They can afford to make this toy many times better, sell for the same price and still enjoy enormous profits. Hopefully Hasbro can make some corrections and go back to making a product that people will want to have in their homes."
3013,1,"I think Amazon needs to offer a minus star category! Hasbro missed the mark by a country mile on this game. Could the game experts at Hasbro please tell me the reasons behind changing the game so completely from the original version? This version is so bad that we used a fine Sharpie and corrected the cards to read what they were in the original. If you are thinking of buying this game, DON'T! Instead come up with an additional $6 and buy the retro version."
3014,3,"This is not the original sorry game. It only has 3 pawns per team instead of the traditional 4. The rules are different also. These rules state that you can exit your home zone with any forward moving card..which is everything except for 4?!?! They ruined the game! This is like the millennial version, do everything to make it easier for the players to make it a quick game. Very sad. Look for the original!"
3015,1,"This is not the original Sorry I grew up with. They made it way too easy, by changing a few rules (you can move out of start with any forward-moving number card, instead of having to draw a 1 or 2) and decreasing the amount of pieces to move per player to 3. After playing the old one with my young kids, this one was a major let down. If you can, track down the older version. Skip this one."
3016,2,"I would give this zero stars if I could! If you’re into the original sorry game, DON’T buy this version. They changed the rules entirely while ruining the whole game! There are no long 4 pawns per person, they only have 3. And rather than only being able to get out on a 1 or 2, you can get out on any number.. oh and the “sorry!” card which allows you to bump someone back to start, now also has the option to move 4 places. It’s like this game was created for this new generation of entitled children that can’t take the time to finish a challenging game the right way without throwing a fit because they have instant gratification issues. Wish I opened it sooner so I could return it. I am very diasspointed in this update."
3017,3,"We bought this to replace our old Sorry game that was falling apart. I wish we had read the reviews first instead of assuming it was still the classic Sorry--it is definitely not.Differences:- Game board design (doesn't look as good, but it doesn't interfere with play)- 3 pawns instead of 4- Sorry cards can be used to move you forward 4 spaces- Can leave Start on ANY forward-moving card- The 2 card doesn't have you draw againHonestly, if I had known those things, I would NOT have bought this game. One reviewer called it the Millennial version, and I'm going to agree. The original game was an excellent tool for teaching kids to suck it up if things didn't go the way they wanted. Everyone else's pawns are out and yours are still in Start because you haven't drawn a 1 or 2? Too bad! Your opponent drew a Sorry card and sent you home? Deal with it! This new version is for wimps and crybabies.And why only 3 pawns? Cutting costs, most likely.Hasbro, you've mucked up a great game. I'll be looking for the real version and donating this one (though I might put a warning on the box)."
3018,3,The game board is not one of the better layouts I have seen. Card arrangement leaves players hunting for their card on the board and often places the duplicate card in very close proximity. Blue and Green game chips are both very dark. Not the easiest to differentiate in certain lighting conditions or if anyone is slightly color blind. Need better contrast between colors. Red chips are too few in number to be used as alternate color.
3019,3,"I'm just in shock because I paid almost 14 dollars and I expected at least for all the details to be there. The box was torn apart, all the little bags inside were open, there was only one card and I didn't count the chips but they were all over the game box. Overall - I'm disappointed, couldn't play the game."
3020,3,"The game is okay, but so simple, outdated and lacking in originality that my family was bored with it before finishing the first game and I doubt we'll every play it again. Back in the day when you had chess, checkers, Monopoly and a deck of cards this probably seemed interesting, but in the age of Settlers of Cataan, Carcasone, Dominion, Castle Panic, Cards Against Humanity and a hundred other innovative, exciting games--this one just doesn't stack up.Might be fun to play with a grandparent who likes games, but isn't so good at trying new things."
3021,3,Love this game but our game came missing pieces. There are supposed to be 50 of each color chip. There were 50 of the blue and green but only 35 of the red. Unfortunately we didn't find this out until we played a particularly long game and my daughter ran out of chips before the rest of us. We're outside of Amazon's return window so tough luck fur us I guess. We checked when we opened it to make sure we had everything but we unfortunately didn't think we'd need to count each individual chip.
3022,3,"This review pertains not to the game in general but the quality of the product lately. I have had the exact set before but I took it to a friends place once and it never came back! They loved it...so much for the game itself.I ordered it again in December 2018 but was disappointed to see that quality of the materials used has deteriorated considerably. The chips are lighter, cheaper plastic, the fold-able board seems fragile, the card deck is very very light - almost feels a tad thicker than printer paper. Instructions now printed on what seems like recycled paper (I don't mind that, but worth noting). Yes, I did get it for a bargain at $12. However, now it makes sense why the price was low. Too bad that they made it look like an offer price. Honestly I would not mind paying $20 for a better quality version. Should have tried the Tin case version, but who knows if they are any different.If anyone is reading for what the game is like - CLASSIC. Just buy this, easy to learn and a lot of fun to play!"
3023,3,This item was purchased new.. but when I opened up the package with this in it... it looked like it had gone through a tornado. It was bent and ripped on every possible side of the box.. which is where you are supposed to store the Jenga pieces when you are done! The actual Jenga pieces feel much cheaper than the ones we previously had.
3024,1,"BEWARE these blocks are tiny. I have played this at tailgates and parties and other games are much much bigger.The size of the block is not listed in the product description. However, someone asked how big they were and the answer said 7.5 inches. These are only 6 inches and are too small."
3025,3,I got this game for my family to play and I was very angry to see when I opened the box to find mold and yellow and brown crust on the outside of the blocks! This is supposed to be a kids game and I for sure don't want my kids playing with mold! I'm sending it back in hopes the next one will be safe to use. I was very excited to play it and now I have to deal with sending it back and waiting again. I would give this 0 stars but I had to pick one.
3026,3,"The Classic Jenga has turned into cheap junk. The ""hardwood"" feels more like styrofoam, the pieces are all slightly asymmetrical, and the wood burned logos are faded and inconsistent.How have they managed to mess up blocks? What happened here? My childhood is let down."
3027,3,"I should have listened to the other reviews. The pieces are made in an extraordinarily cheap way. The idea of the game is to pull pieces out based on the pressure points, not to overcome MAXIMUM friction. The pieces are not smooth at all, have little weight, and a few of them were warped out the box. I should have held on to my Jenga game from 10 years ago. Unfortunately, I had this shipped overseas AND the return fees are just not worth any extra cost."
3028,3,"Love this classic game, but they cut corners and it shows. I actually bought this as a second game for parts. The money isn't enough to even start the game with 4 players or the bank will almost be out. Also there is not enough houses or hotels to cover the whole board. You only get enough hotels for half the board so when everyone wants to build you can't. They should at least give you enough pieces to play the game. Also the chance and community chest cards are so few you have to reshuffle constantly to play a full game. They cut costs too much to where you constantly feel the lack of components in every manner. I would have bought an older version if it had all the parts. Instead of buying an extra stack of money and houses it was cheaper to just buy two sets."
3029,3,"My daughter and I were SO excited when we got the package in the mail, and wanted to play it right away. Unfortunately the box had already been opened & taped back together. The game was missing pieces & what was there was not in any of it's bags and thrown all around the box unfortunately!! Super bummed. We sent it back and bought it at walmart instead. The game itself is a lot of fun!"
3030,3,"The dollar sign was a different symbol than $. I don’t know what language the symbol was from but the words were all in English so ...We were also disappointed to see that ALL of the cards were cut wrong. The bottom of each card was lobbed off as if the cutting machine was askew. It gives an overall cheap feel to an otherwise classic game. We were so excited to play it on Christmas Day that we kept it, albeit reluctantly."
3031,3,"The game arrived in a shipping box, only item in the box. Exterior shipping box in pristine condition, sealed. When we opened shipping box we found the Monopoly game box severely damaged, it had to have been in this bad condition when it was placed into the shipping box. Very disappointed."
3032,3,"Not monopoly. Aside from the board delivered folded into four, it was split halfway down the middle. I included a picture the first day i opened it but Amazon took it down because it didnt meet the minimum dollar amount to post a picture (10 or 11dollars, i cant remember, but two weeks later i was asked for the game back by a overseas customer service repBecause she got offended when i said i couldn't understand much of what she was saying. The money amounts and denomitions have been changed, none of the rules. Property values changed. Monopoly has been consistant for over fifty years. Not interested in a broken knock off."
3033,1,"The board quality is terrible. There are creases all over the board out of the newly opened box. The edges cut off because it was very poorly aligned when made. Corners are already bent. We were extremely excited for the game, but when you buy something new you don't expect it to come in second hand. Very disappointing quality. Make sure tp verify where you purchase this game from."
3034,3,"I kept reading reviews about how SUPER FANTASTIC Ticket To Ride is and how it’s the best game EVER!!! so I forked over a lot of money for this expensive game that turned out to be incredibly boring. We played it once and we all pretty underwhelmed. I mean, the internet doesn’t lie, right? We must have done something wrong. Played it a second time. Still, just as dull as the first time.The only excitement the game provides is watching someone with big hands try to hold the baby sized cards.The game would be good for children learning strategy...definitely not adults.Lesson re-learned....don’t trust the internet."
3035,3,"I decided to play for a bit thinking I can still have some fun but A.D. I'm playing I realized there is no blue yellow or white cards not only am I missing that but there is no black pieces so I can't have 5 players and the game isn't so fun without the special missions especially since were all fighting to build over the Orange, green, pink, and red since there is no other colors!!!!!"
3036,3,This is a counterfeit game. When you try to register it the serial number doesn't work. The board doesn't lay flat and it has cracks in it. My friends had the same thing happen to them. If you want this game go and buy it from a store where they are more likely to have a real one that you can actually play. In case you are wondering I bought directly from Amazon not from a third party.
3037,1,"I'm appalled by how many people like this game. To each their own. I understand they love this game, and that's fine, but it's just not for me. I hate this game. So for anyone else like me out there, don't buy this game.The game is played by drawing destination cards and colored railroad cards. The objective is to finish a railroad track between two cities. You compete with others in this and earn points.At its most simple, the game doesn't sound all that objectionable, but I hate the mechanics. The randomness of card drawing, the sabotaging between players, the lack of any real accomplishment... I play this game and don't feel like there's any purpose. It's outright boring. It's tedious. It's long and slow. It's like an adult version of Candy Land.Games are hit and miss with people. This one obviously missed with me. I don't know how best to pass along to someone else how they'll feel about this game. Maybe my description will hit home with you and I'll save you the agony of playing it, maybe you'll have to go through it yourself before realizing it's not a hit for you, or maybe you'll like it. Maybe you just need to give it a try.Do I recommend it? No, not even if you're bored and looking for something new. Will you like it? You may not know unless you try it.How's that for conflicting advice?"
3038,3,"Love Catan, it's a great game... but I think I received a third-party product. The game board is cut badly. The pieces don't link up properly. I have to force them into place. I'm missing the robber, 1 white city, 1 orange city, and 1 red city. The orange and red pieces are so close in colour that it is hard to tell them apart when playing. The wooden roads are cut badly. They are not smooth, but rough on some sides. I have some settlements that are cracked as well. Please check all your pieces when you receive it."
3039,1,"I am extremely upset with my purchase. The overall quality of what I received would be barely worth $10, much less $45. To start out, the game box came damaged around the corners and edges. Removing the individual pieces resulted in a number of pieces ripping (note that I took great care in removing them). NOTHING is uniform: the roads are cut horribly and look more like my attempts at arts and crafts in kindergarten; I received three complete sets of red, orange, and white settlements, cities, and roads, but my fourth set consists of 4 yellow cities, 5 orange(!!!) settlements, and 15 blue roads. Is that something I can fix with a paint brush? You bet. Should I have to fix the pieces of a newly purchased game? Absolutely not. Additionally, 2/4 white cities are discolored and poorly cut.I've grown to love Catan and will be moving out of state soon, so I felt that it was time to purchase the game for myself since I won't be able to mooch of friends any longer. I had hoped this $45 purchase would allow me to bring the joy of the game to my new home and share it with new friends; I will not be able to do that with this set.A warning/suggestion: buy directly from the company that makes the game, not from Amazon.**EDIT:After further inspection, the border pieces also do not fit together properly."
3040,3,"Good game but seller provided a mismatched set, with missing pieces.It looks like this set might have been composed of spare parts harvested from different batches or used sets. I think this because about half the cards are slightly off-color. Not a big deal.The second problem is that the outer board pieces do not connect properly. Regardless of whether they are joined end-to-end according to the printed numbers or not, the pieces just do not fit together. We have to play with the outer tiles disconnected in one place so that the resource tiles will all fit in. Not a huge deal but pretty disappointing considering I purchased this as ""new"" and expected it to work completely.The third problem is that the white player's five settlements are missing. We play with small white beads instead. Disappointing.One last minor issue is that since the compentents are from mismatched sets, we have a yellow player but an orange reference card. Sometimes confuses new players who setup the game. ""where's the orange player? Where's the yellow card?""Minus one star for each defect."
3041,3,"This was purchased to replace our old, well loved, but falling apart Settler's of Catan.Unfortunately the quality of this game just isn't as good as the old version. The frame of the board doesn't fit together well and makes it difficult to play.Some of the wood pieces came broken or misformed.And the colors of the wood peices in the this game and the expansion pack don't match!If i didn't need a replacement for my old game so badly, I would return this one...Dissappointing, I thought the ""new"" version was supposed to be an improvement."
3042,3,I ordered this game as a gift for friends. We LOVE this game but the one they received doesn't have pieces that are cut correctly. The outer part of the game that forms the hex and has the ports never stays connected. It's very hard to play because as a result the hexes do not fit inside the hex correctly and during regular game play everything gets shifted and disconnected. It's so frustrating since we all love the game! :-( . The game itself is 10 stars but the one we received is defective.
3043,2,"We are a huge gaming family and have about 60 games. We don't watch much TV as a family, but we play games at least a couple of times a week. We have many strategy games and were looking for one you could use for bigger groups because there are often more than 4-6 of us that want to play and many strategy games don't go beyond that number.After reading the stellar reviews on Avalon we purchased this game. In the game, some people are good and some are evil and the whole game is about finding out who is good and who is evil. It is a simple game where you discuss who is evil and good and try to prove your innocence, whether you are good or evil. The evil people must lie and deceive to win. The good must use deductive reasoning to discern who is evil, and this is actually the really fun part of the game.When playing this game as a family, I watched as my two chatty teenage sons became quiet and hardly said a word. They had picked evil cards and clearly they weren't comfortable lying about their innocence and then trying to convince others that other good people were evil. I also picked an evil card and though I was much better at it than my sons, it made me very uncomfortable to deceive and lie to my family and my children's friends. It is not a game of just bluffing, it is a game of all out deception. The better liar you are, the better you will do if you are chosen to be evil. What was terrible is that we, the evil 3, won.This is not a game that I am comfortable with playing in a group of friends or family. We simply don't feel that we should teach our children that they should never lie, and then tell them it is OK just for a game. I'm sure my children would have become better liars as they played the game a few more times, but who wants to develop that trait in their children or themselves? We got rid of the game and won't be playing it again."
3044,3,More hype than anything. Total snooze fest. Decent artwork. Don't expect 1st time players to like this game. It would take too much valuable time to deceive you and to say this is an actually good game.
3045,2,I could not bring myself to play it. I opened it up and started going through the tokens and cards. The lady of the lake is pornographic - very suggestively mostly nude. This is a game marketed towards families!!! While game play may be fun (the comments lead me to believe it is) the artwork makes it something I could never play. Very disappointed!
3046,3,"A truly brilliant game marred by a confusing instruction booklet. Took my family 2 years of reading the manual before I finally went on Youtube to see how it was played and then we were all like, ""Ohhhhhhhh....well why didn't they just say that?"""
3047,3,"The resistance: Avalon is a very interesting party game to play for 5-10 people, and works best for 7-8 people. This is best especially if you like reasoning and talking a lot as the game encourages free discussion. I would give 9/10 for the game itself.However, the cards are not framed in plastics so they could wear off as you play them for a long time. I played for around 5 times and it is okay. They might start losing color after a while, so consider buying one with plastic seal.They are also too big to carry around in your pocket, so you will have to carry them in a bag, which is not ideal for me as I prefer keeping them around in a much more portable way."
3048,1,"Not only is this not what they advertise but I got charged $19.50 instead of the advertised $15 for what I had ordered. I got the Kingdom of sweets version which I specifically did not want. I had researched extensively and was so happy when I found this seller offering a more toned down, less spastic version of this classic game. The one they sent is easily available at many stores for a 1/4 of what they charged me. CONCLUSION: DON'T BUY FROM THEM UNLESS YOU WANT A FREE STICKER THAT SAYS SUCKER TO PUT ON YOUR FOREHEAD. Oh and they did not send any type of receipt in the box to return it. I will make it my mission to do so :)."
3049,3,"I couldn't wait to buy Candy Land for my daughter. I loved Candy Land when I was younger & I remember being jealous of the newer, cooler versions that came out after ""my time"".I couldn't wait to open this box...but I was very disappointed when I opened the box. The game board is TOO busy! It's jam-packed with colors, characters, candy, scenery, etc. It's hard to even see what's going on! It's overwhelming. & honestly, it's ugly!we are considering buying a used version of this game that is not so ugly. this board game is over-designed & poorly designed.it's sad what has happened to this game...they should have left it well enough alone a few versions ago..."
3050,2,"The new layout of this game is terrible for young children. The spaces are too small for the game pieces (which is challenging for little hands with developing fine motor skills) and the graphics are way too busy (which makes it hard for a child to easily follow the path). The recommended age range is 3-6, which I think was accurate for the original design, but it is certainly not true now. I was very disappointed when I saw the game board and we no longer try to play it because it is too frustrating for my daughter."
3051,3,"I purchased this for my granddaughter thinking it was the classic version of the game. It's not. The female characters have had lip fillers and boob jobs. I remember playing this with my children as an early introduction to games that instilled fair play and how to win and lose graciously. This version has no ""winner."" It's all about the ""adventure"" which is fine, but then what is the point of a board game?"
3052,3,"I bought this and quickly returned it because the illustrations are repulsive. I grew up on the 1984 version. Just take a look at the Queen Frostine and compare them between the two versions. No wonder women have a hard time these days and constantly feel like they aren't enough; these unattainable bodies lead to more plastic surgery etc. Milton Bradley should be ashamed, you are following in Disney's footsteps."
3053,1,"I have played Battleship since I was a child. Overall, the game play has never changed, even with this set. Yes, there are planes, but it really is just more of the same. Hasbro just added another ""ship"" to sink.Pros:1. Same, classic game play.2. The length of the game is perfect. It's not Monopoly that takes hours, but also not something that is finished in five minutes.3. It get's kids thinking and trying to predict where the competitor would logically place his/her ships.Cons:1. Cheap and flimsy! Plastic is not that expensive. It wouldn't kill Hasbro to make the plastic thicker and nicer so the game isn't forever tipping over.2. The pegs fall out which kind of defeats the point of the whole game.So, overall, the game is the same, but the quality is garbage. It's a shame too."
3054,3,Terrible waste of money and disappointing to my son and I. The (2) game boards are so light they tip over all the time by the slightest touch. And you have to pick them up a lot because the clear plastic part where you put the pegs can't be read - transparent. You can't see the #'s or the letters. Giant failure and ruined what we thought would be so fun.
3055,3,"Flimsy set, small pieces which are not easy for grownup hands to hold. Hard to read the coordinates because no contrast between plastic and letters/numbers. Also not meant for storing the pieces because cover doesn’t easily close and pieces can spill out. I love playing the game itself but will probably order a new set which is more expensive and better made."
3056,3,"This game is everything it should be. Hours and hours of fun. However this version is crap. It is so small that all the ships and pins won't fit in each tray. The one that I got had the call marker grid already broken off. You also can't close the trays with the ships in place, so you can stop play and resume another time. And forget about holding this in your lap... that isn't going to happen, pieces fall everywhere. I'm sending this scrappy version back and getting the retro one. It is $3 more and people say much better."
3057,2,"Love this game! However bought this as a gift. The box was damaged and opened... Had no other choice but to give it to our friend, however it was embarrassing as it looked like I just took it out of our toy closet to gift."
3058,3,"Ordered ""blokus classic"" (the larger version pictured here) and paid about $35 for it. Was sent the smaller, newer, cheaper version instead. I could have gotten that version much cheaper anywhere else. I must agree with the other reviewer who said this is a typical bait & switch. I am attempting to send it back. I'm not sure if the classic version is available anywhere at all. I guess there's no way to tell for sure what you'll get from the seller. It's not like I didn't check first, I tried."
3059,2,"Here's my first 1 star review. Because the false advertising. I paid $35 including shipping for this version, because, according to its website, it is a older version which is bigger and suitable for a 6 years old (5+), while there is a newer version which is smaller and lower in price, only 18.11 and shipping fee free (for prime, who I am). When I receive the item, guess what? is the newer smaller and lower price version! I then check the 1 star reviews, it turns out that I am the only one who encounter this problem. I am very unhappy and am returning it."
3060,2,"I was expecting the nice version of this game that my son had at his preschool. Unfortunately, this is a much more cheaply made version, where there are almost no ridges for the tiles to sit in, so the tiles end up sliding around very easily. Super-frustrating for little kids who are still working on their motor skills. I would not have bought this if I'd realized this would happen."
3061,3,"Without saying so in any advertising description, they shrunk the game to such a tiny size that it is awful. I just printed out the return label, and I’m pretty ticked. No notice at all that it had been cut back so much. Plus the entire storage system for the game is gone, and the box isn’t even appropriate for keeping the pieces in. Goodness. I’m losing faith."
3062,3,"I had the ""deluxe"" version of Blokus at home with a big board and sturdy pieces. I've wanted to give it as a gift but the version I saw in stores has a small board/pieces. When I saw the deluxe game on Amazon with the bigger board, I ordered it as a gift. What I received was NOT the deluxe version as listed in the item description but the cheaper version I could've gotten cheaper elsewhere."
3063,3,A lot of the blue city cards had tiny tears at the top left of the cards for some reason. Game also came without 2 of the pawns in the bag that had them all in it.. how?! Also got one extra cube of one color and one less of another.Its not game breaking but come on.. I was excited to play this until i started counting out all the pieces and got bummed. Didn't open it and check as soon as I got it and now I regret it.
3064,3,I bought this game thinking that my son and grandson could play it. My husband and I both read the instructions for the game and we both concluded that the instructions are terrible. The reviews are misleading and I wish that I had not purchased it. It is not appropriate for an eight year old or even our 12 year old grandson..
3065,2,"Our family HATED this game!!! First, the game is EXTREMELY complicated. Check out YouTube videos to see how it’s played. We invested the time to learn it after reading so many good reviews. But the game is IMPOSSIBLE to win.Each player only gets 4 moves; including moving one small space or picking up ONE infection cube. But after each player’s turn, you have to infect 2, 3, or 4 random cities, depending on the stage you are in. It’s impossible to keep up with the new infections. Soon you run out of player cards and the game ends.We played over, and over, and over at the easiest level but still never came close to winning. We even cheated by only adding one new infection cube when the Epidemic card was drawn instead of three. We thought we must have missed something in the instructions, but after hours of reading and re-reading, we found there is no mistake. It's just a poorly constructed game. Very aggravating! We threw the game away."
3066,3,"Was excited to receive this game based on all the positive reviews. When I did an inventory of the infection cards, I noticed that I was three short. Comparing them to the other cards, I realized I was missing Tokyo, Tapei and Sydney. It is clearly evident that the cards were wrapped to soon, since these were the last three cards in the deck. Hopefully the company does the right thing."
3067,1,"We've seriously been waiting 9 months after sending 1 email a month and we have had no response! The game itself is incredible, but we received two of the red disease cube bags and no yellow cube bag, this makes the game SUPER frustrating because it is possible for the diseases to overlap. If you run into this issue just return the stupid thing and try again. The game is amazing, entertaining, challenging and intense. Nobody who is in to board games should miss out on this, but I've never had such horrible and non-existent customer service. Z-man games is pathetic."
3068,3,Bought it after reading many positive reviews and watching gameplay on Youtube. The game is incredibly simplistic and boring. There is very little room for strategy and player interaction is non-existent. This may be a good game for children under 10 years old. It's closer to a puzzle than a game.
3069,3,"Package came sealed. I opened it and one of the punch out cards was missing a tile, I thought it might have fallen out inside the box; I took everything out and checked the whole box. My thought was how does a sealed game have components missing. Well this a bummer for me I was excited to try this game out. It might be just a lemon. Personally I expect when I pay for a new product for it to come with all the components."
3070,3,Just opened it up and the product quality is horrible. The production company really messed this one up. I'm very disappointed that the game looks like it has been used for years the first time I open it. The punch board pieces were not punched down all the way and it caused the pieces to get damaged and marked. It took a while to prep the game. Also the box has a lot of damage external and internal damage. Especially where you store the parts. Still excited to try the game out but just disappointed in the cheap production.
3071,3,"Looks like I got one of the counterfeit copies. Inconsistent print quality, irregular meeples, subpar box quality. Tile backs are much lighter than official game and expansions. If a warehouse deal seems too good to be true it just may be. Carcassonne is an amazing game but the product I received is garbage."
3072,3,i bought the game as a gift but it arrived damaged. i had no time to exchange it and had to give away a damages gift!! I am quite unhappy about this.there had been plenty of room in the box. i think an item with clearly visible damage has been packed(the game itself is lots of fun!!!).
3073,2,"This built quality isn't the same. I bought it because I played this at my friend's place and the material quality was so nice. The chips feel so good in your hand, like professional poker chips.But this is noticingly difference. The chip feels plasticity and the card doesn't have nice finish like my friend's does. This thing is not something worth $20+ anymore, it's going back for sure."
3074,2,"I bought this game after playing at a local board game cafe few days ago. I ordered it as soon as I got home but when I received the game 2 days later I was so disappointed. The game play is of course still the same and the design is same but the chips have definitely changed. Reduced quality from previous printing of Splendor. The only reason why I was so tempted to buy this game after playing a round or two at a cafe was because of chips' poker chip like quality, its heaviness and because chips were actually beautiful like real jewel that fits to the jewel game! The reason why Splendor is not on the cheap side but still worth buying was despite its simple game play and not actually having a board for a board game (only cards and chips are components) because of its high quality chips. Old version chips are heavy and metal-like (also magnetic so proves it's not plastic) and every time you lay a chip or take chips away during game play it makes nice and loud clanking noises that add to the gaming experience like playing with casino chips. However the copy I received were definitely plastic chips. I bought splendor because I was absorbed by beautiful components but now nothing about the game is beautiful as the chips are mere plastic. NOT WORTH TO PAY 29.99 for less than 50 cards and about ~30 plastic chips."
3075,3,"I love this game but what I received was a cheaply made package. The cards were dirty and gritty, not slick like any new deck of cards. The tokens were really cheap and discolored. Looked like. They had been sitting out in the sun for weeks. ALso looked like they just fell into the toilet and someone fetched them out and packaged them together with gunk still on the edges. Some of the tokens didn't even come with any stickers.And to think I paid $40 for this cheaply produced game."
3076,3,"We are a smart family who enjoys games of strategy. This game fails on every level, with the exception of the illustrations (nice work, Pascal) and the high quality of the materials. Clearly the rules were lost in translation, what the what? There are multiple gaps in the rules in addition to a total lack of clarity in the instructions (we had to read the rules several times then made up rules to account for the gaps and to make the game progress forward). We have nearly a hundred games and this is the first & only game that we unanimously say 'BORING.' It takes a long time to accumulate enough gem tokens to buy prestige points so the game really drags."
3077,3,"This particular Splendor game has far lower quality materials than the previous Splendor I got from 3 years ago. I'm not sure if whether the game maker has decided to reduce costs or if the seller is sourcing from a .The chip tiles are much lighter. The actual box is made with flimsier cardboard. The cards are less flexible and feel like worse quality. The game itself is playable, but it feels like such a downgrade from our previous Splendor game. I wish I had bought it in a store.I would have returned it if I didn't buy it for a game night with company."
3078,3,"Well my board came with a misprint. On the bottom where it should be triple letter score it has it written as a triple word score. So now my board has an extra triple word score.. Bummer. Also, the game board is cheap and it is not tile lock at all. There are just little pegs that somewhat keep the tiles in place, but most certainly do not lock. The face of the board is just a sticker put on top of plastic. I like the fact that the board is smaller than a normal scrabble board but some may not. Regretting purchase, but at least I can play Scrabble (kind of).Cons:Cheaply MadeMisprinted BoardNot locking tilePro:Smaller board."
3079,2,"This was the biggest waste of money. Nothing at all like i was expecting. And I'm not really sure where all the good reviews are coming from. Maybe from people who have never played scrabble before...? I dont know. My first issue.. The tiles are much smaller than the original. Which, i guess, isn't a huge deal. My second issue, and it's the whole reason for this review, is that the ""tile lock"" feature, that is suppose to keep tiles in place, does not do this at all. It actually does quite the opposite. As you play Scrabble, you lay down your word onto the board. After placing your word, you go back and count your points. Most people, as far as i know, need to give each tile a slight lift to see if there is a bonus spot under it. Well with this version, as you lift one tile, even in the slightest of ways, every other tile in line with that one gets pulled up too, only to completely jumble the word and make you have to reset the tiles again. I love playing scrabble, and have enjoyed teaching my kids how to play. But i absolutely refuse to even touch this version of it again. Just disappointing."
3080,1,This scrabble game is very cheap made. As a family we have played Scrabble for years. It is one of our favorite board games. The only complaint I have when playing Scrabble is not being able to keep the tiles that have been played in place. When my husband saw this particular Scrabble board on Amazon we loved that it kept all the played tiles in place. With it being affordable we were very excited about ordering it. After receiving it we were very disappointed with how small and cheap made this particular version of Scrabble was made. It is the smallest Scrabble game I have ever seen and is pretty much a piece of cardboard. I do not recommend the Scrabble game to any Scrabble lovers out there.
3081,1,"Shipping was fast and the packaging was adequate. However, you should know that this product is smaller than a typical Scrabble board. I was looking for something that would truly lock the tiles in place, as we have cats that want to be involved in the game. Frustrating! Anyway, these tiles (and board) are much smaller than a normal game, and the tiles most certainly do not lock.Furthermore, the light weight of the tiles makes it difficult to properly place them...or even pick them up. Truth be told, we could do a faster game with our old board even if we just played using our elbows.Inexpensive, so not worth a return. Just want to perhaps save someone else from making my mistake."
3082,3,"I thought this would be good. A Scrabble game where the letters locked in place, so you wouldn't accidentally bump them out of place or scatter when you move the board. Boy was I disappointed. Not only are the tiles hard to get into place, they are easily knocked out of their squares, and bumping the board is just as catastrophic as ever. Maybe worseThe one good thing is that the backs of the tiles are not flat, so you can't mistake the back for a blank, but that's small consolation for a board that is much more difficult to play than the standard."
3083,3,"Our kids were playing the game, and the bug died. I assumed it is the battery that died. Though it has been too soon that the battery died, I thought that it may happen sometimes. I bought battery for hex bug and replaced it, but it turns out that the issue was not due to the battery. The hex bug is dead. Now I have to purchase a new hex bug (8.99 for one or 19 for 5). Not very happy :(."
3084,3,"I got this game for my kids for Christmas and the bug only goes to the right. I started to get so frustrated because I could not get the bug to turn my direction, even though it had a clear path. It would instead essentially go in circles. We thought maybe it was the board and that it was crooked or something. So we put it on a level tabletop and it just went in a circle. Total waste if money. Very disappointed."
3085,3,"Opened this game on a rainy day but it was missing the connector pieces to keep the utensils from moving. I live in the bahamas so products are shipped to a US address & then brought in by a local shipping company. A return will cost more than I paid for the product and more hassle than it is worth. My son loves the hexbug that came with it, however we are disappointed we can't play the game."
3086,3,"Cons:I did receive a defective hex bug piece. I noticed that other people get it with a plastic thing that you pull, and you open the bug package. Mine did not have one, not only that - the cap was glued to the box with a paper, I had to really mess up a “collectible item” package to get the bug out. (Quality control - ???) I could have returned the game and asked for replacement but how can you do it when your kids are already excited sitting there waiting to set it up and play. :(Pros:- Nice big box. Like back in the day when board games came in big boxes and it was kind of a big deal.- It’s fun! My kids can’t stop playing it.- It’s unique."
3087,3,"I was all set to write a rave review about this game, we were having such a great time with tons of laughter. But then the bug died... first time playing it! The adults were dismayed, but the kids were shattered! Family members were searching for a replacement battery, but I don't think they've found one yet. But what's the good of getting one if the game is going to quit on us again so soon!"
3088,2,I would return this product if I didn't think it would cost too much in postage. Didn't even get to the cards. I tried on one of the mouthpieces and it is painful. I couldn't keep it in my mouth for more than a few seconds. I had imagined the plastic to be much softer. Very disappointing. I was going to use it as a game at an upcoming dinner party. I wouldn't dare ask any guests to put one in...
3089,1,"Disappointed with so many aspects of this game. First, when it arrived, the packaging was shredded and the box of the game itself was crushed and torn like it had been run over by a car a few times. I opened the box to see if the cards and mouthpieces were damaged but they seemed to be fine. However, when I had some friends over to play the game we noticed several things were wrong. First, the cards had many, many duplicate phrases. It's as though they just reprinted the same cards over and over again to make it look like a full deck. So when we played, we would pull a card and it would be exactly the same phrase someone else had just said. This doesn't exactly make the game very challenging. Second, some of the words on various cards were misspelled or incorrect making things very confusing when trying to play. For example, the word basketball was spelled ""baskherball"" on one of the phrases on the card and since there were duplicates of this card, it meant that it was misspelled on several cards. Another example, the word returned was spelled as ""returner"". There were other incorrect words as well. One would think that the makers of this game would perform better quality control and proofread the phrases before printing the cards and selling the game.Overall, I'm very dissatisfied with this product and would not recommend it to anyone. The only positive thing I can say is that the dental mouthpieces worked as they should. This is the only reason I gave this product one star."
3090,1,"After seeing a hilarious video of a family playing this game on youtube last year, I could not wait to find out what the name of the game was, order it, and take to our Christmas family get-together for what was sure to be a rip roaring good time. (heck, I purchased a bottle of Patron for margaritas to sip on as we played) However, I don't know what that family on youtube was doing to have the cheek retractors impair their speech in such a hilarious way, but I can assure you it was not solely from the cheek retractors provided. My daughter was visiting for Thanksgiving and convinced me we should try them out for a laugh before the unveiling at the huge family Christmas party in December. Boy, am I glad I allowed her to persuade me. We opened up the box of extra retractors (there are two sizes neither work) and they are easy enough to get into your mouth, and yes you do look ridiculous. In fact, the two of us had a jolly good time laughing at what the other looked like. But, the fun stopped there. Just for the sport of it, while her dad looked on, we tried talking to each other. We could understand exactly what we were saying. We thought maybe it is specific phrases that contain certain constant or vowel sounds that cause the problem. While ""B's"" and ""P's"" are a little garbled we still knew what was being said. My husband just shook his head and walked away and under his breath was heard "" what a waste of money"". My adult daughter and I brought up phrases on line and tried those like rubber, baby buggy bumpers and bible book club - a little garble, but still no problem understanding what was being said. - Don't waste your money. There are plenty of funny family games out there, this is just not one of them...........But, one redeeming thought: they would be great for the family Christmas photo."
3091,2,"I was really excited to get this game for my 11 year old brother as a Christmas gift. We were going on a family trip and I thought that this would be a fun game to play as a family. Before we left for our trip, my brother and I played the game and I was not impressed at all. First, the plastic mouth openers HURT! And it didn't matter what size we used; I tried the small ones and they were still uncomfortable. We couldn't keep them in our mouths for more than 30 seconds before we had to take them out. Second, the phrases were really weird that crossed over the 'weird, but fun' line and made it something that wasn't even fun to play. Part of the enjoyment of the game is your partner being able to guess what you say, so we ended up going through the stacks of cards to find phrases that weren't completely weird random words. We played it for about five minutes and then decided that it wasn't even worth taking on the trip to play with the rest of our family. If I could return the game, I would because it just wasn't very fun."
3092,3,I ordered this game for a weekend road trip with friends. We wound up not being able to play for more than a few minutes because the spacers were painful. It's not the actual keeping open of the mouth that is the problem. The spacers rub against your upper cheeks/gums when trying to speak which caused pain. We tried both the medium and small spacers and found the same issue with both. We didn't play more than 2 cards before we gave up. I will say that the 2 quick rounds we played were a lot of fun. It is unfortunate that such a fun game has this design flaw.
3093,3,"Great game, but this box came to me like it had even bruised and battered and carried through several fascists hands. There is multiple cuts on the box and two edges of the box are ripped. There is also a hole in the back but I assume that is from the shipping because the outside shipping box had the same hole. Regardless of the shipping though, the box already looked used and worn and I definitely did not pay $35 for a hand me down."
3094,1,This game is disgusting. How can you people play it? Do you really support hitler? Do you really support and anti Semitic game?? What if there were black slave games? How fun let’s see who what’s to be a slave and who wants to be a masterPlease stop purchasing this game it’s so sad that the death of family and friends is funny and made into a board game.
3095,3," (First off, 0 stars for gameplay but 5 starts for quality of the board and pieces. VERY high quality)The first few times you play this with your friends you'll have a ton of fun and laugh and think its a great game. by about the 8th time you realize that the element of chance completely ruins a deduction game. The whole idea is you're supposed to figure out who hitler is by analyzing peoples behavior (playing liberal or fascist tokens). However, about 30% of the time a player is forced to play one token or another with the rest of the table having no idea if it was by choice or not. What this means is that there is no real strategy to the game is basically random. This game is never coming off the shelf."
3096,3,"Bought from the seller 'Secret Hitler'. It had a code on the back to verify that it was an official version. It turns out it is a knockoff. It looks pretty legit and exactly the same quality as the other versions that I have played. It wasn't missing any pieces so I'm not overly concerned about it, but would rather the money go to the official sellers."
3097,3,I was super excited to get this game because I had played it with some friends over the holidays. After receiving the game I noticed that not all the pieces were provided. I messaged the seller but didn't receive a response. It is very frustrating that I didn't get what was mentioned in the description. The thing that most frustrates me is that we cant even play the game with the max people mentioned because we don't have all of the pieces needed to do so.
3098,1,"Yesterday just as I was getting ready to buy an XXL shaft this poorly written app crashed and proof away went all my money, I lost everything. Today I actually purchased $4.99 and $9.99 for Amazon coins. Guess what, proof and now I lost real money. User beware. I had a high game of 306,00 points and to lose everything, including real money, is wrong."
3099,3,"First, I noticed how SLOW the download was compared to every other app I've installed. After finally installing the game will not load (I'm on a Kindle Fire HD on 5g wifi with well over 350mbps of RAM .... not sure what the problem could be. I got to play for 10 minutes or so last night after I turned off the wifi while traveling home. However, today even that didn't ""fix"" it. The graphics are worse than Evolution in my opinion, and I just realized that I've been struggling to play a game that is almost 500mb. Seriously?! I cannot believe it has over 4 stars."
3100,1,"It is horrible, I had the xl sharks and then I log on again an hour later boom! I have to start over so can u plz fix this or I will stop playing, I had spent hours a day on it and I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooo happy about my shark and u take it all away this is really really really really really stupid so u need to fix this fgol I will stop PLAYING until u fix this. I do not recommend this game unless u wAnt to risk having it ALL deleted. Sorry to be so harsh but is was so depressing."
3101,2,"So this is a fun game until if malfunctions and you would like to retain your data but are forced to start over with zero saved progress.

3102,3,I loved this game... Played ALOT and then my saved progress was corrupted and had to start from the beginning after I had gotten past xl sharks! But I came back and was just beginning to make some good progress and it happened again. I would love to keep playing this game but not interested in starting over constantly :(.
3103,3,"After opening this app with my Amazon Fire TV it didn't function correctly. Only the movement of the character worked, I couldn't do anything else. Yes my controller was functioning properly and no I'm not 75 year old, I know how this stuff should work. Stupid broken app."
3104,3,"The rewards are incredibly slow. It starts off every 3 minutes when you die, next time is 30, then 3 hours, then finally 6 hours. To earn coins you need 80 for a box and get maybe 3-4 per map. So figuring most power ups need 6-20 for upgrade, they are random, and there is over a dozen this will take quite a while to get a useful one."
3105,3,been playing since july 2015 and love this game.However- the sound goes off a lot at start up sometimes 8 times in a row or it will go super loud. had to replace receiver a while back and reload game. hardly ever get weapon upgrades'.
3106,3,"Did not order this, someone else ordered it on my account; but since it didn't cost anything it is still on my account. This and several games were ordered on my account and I did not order them. It is so frustrating that these items were ordered and when I called to complain, nothing happened; still seeing items on my account that I did not order."
3107,1,"Great idea for the game, but making movements with your figure sucksss. It is hard to enjoy a game that will not let you move without getting attacked or drove over. I would not suggest this game unless it is fixed. Sorry."
3108,3,"Make sure you save to Game Circle. I never saw an option to do this in game. I only heard about Game Circle after I lost my game and I contacted user support. I thought since I connected it to my Facebook account that I would be safe. Wrong. They put through an update to ""improve my gaming experience,"" and all of my progress is gone. It was a decently fun game but I'm not about to start over."
3109,3,It seems that everyone on kindle fire is having the same problem. So can't you fix the glitch? I can see the tutorial but the screen I'm playing on is like glitching. I can see it for a few seconds. Please please PLEASE fix this! (If you don't then it seems your not paying attention to customer reviews!).
3110,3,"I thought that this game was going to be fun, it looked really cool. When I got it, it kept asking reload old game or new game. Whenever I selected new game, it would restart from the barn. I don't understand why it kept saying that I had an old game, I just barely downloaded this app. Please fix this!"
3111,3,Playing on a Kindle has limited play. After playing forever my game has been taken away by Amazon since the 8/30/18 update. I can't get on it at all and lost everything I worked to get over the past few years.
3112,3,"When I first downloaded this game, it said that I already had an account on this game when I had never played it before. It kept askinging, reload current game or start new one? I kept saying,reload current game and it would reload and I would be building the house AGAIN. I clicked build and the screen asking to reload current game or start a new one came back. Once again, I clicked reload current game and it sent me back to building the house. Couldn't get past building the house. SO ANNOYING!"
3113,3,"I have to agree with what a number of other reviewers have said. After a long wait, I was let down by this game. While the game play feels relatively similar to KH 2 and the graphics and open world are beautiful, the story feels lacking in originality. Everything feels like one giant product placement for Disney, the quick time attacks are all Disney theme park rides and the worlds feel as though they were chosen because of their popularity instead of any real reason to the plot (looking at you Frozen and Toy Story). In previous games, there were Disney worlds, but they had unique-ish story lines instead of plots directly from movies and the original worlds were amazing (Traverse Town, Twilight Town, Hollow Bastion, Castle Oblivion, The World That Never Was etc. . .., Disney seems to be pandering to its fans -- was anyone surprised when the full song of ""Let it Go"" was included with an almost shot for shot remake from the movie? It's also disappointing that Cloud, Leon, Yuffie, Aerith and Cid are all missing when they played semi-essential roles in the first two games. Also there are times when the it feels more like brief game play between long cut scenes, instead of vice versa. Overall, I haven't been that impressed with the game."
3114,1,"1 star is a little harsh, as gameplay can be semi enjoyable at moments. But the makers have done so much to ruin a once great fanchise, that the end result feels like they did EVERYTHING they could to extract the good elements, while simultaneously injecting trash throughout the game.The plot has always been a bit vague, but it's clear now that it has no particular direction. None of the dialogue is necessary, and it takes forever to sit through. There is no option to speed it up or skip a line, so I simply have to skip entire scenes at this point, to stop wasting my time on development within the Disney worlds, where we already know the story. I want to see plot development on the world of Kingdom Hearts, which is nonexistent.Additionally, I have yet to see any final fantasy characters. Even if a couple will come a little later, I'm over 20 hours in and have been denied the enjoyment of seeing any familiar faces. There is absolutely no relevant character development. As the plot refuses to move forward, so do all the characters stories.The combat system is the worst. It is overwhelmed with a ton of cutscene, enemy mowing specials, that take away the challenge, and makes the player wonder why this game wasn't a movie, since all of the combat is being watched in a cutscene, instead of played out by the gamer.No more forms, not in the way we once knew them. You run into combat, button mash an enemy for 10 seconds, and now you can access an uninteresting form, that at best, is a shadow of one of the old forms, or at worst, was dreamt up by this new team that completely lacks creative direction. The form accessed by your default keyblade is the only way I've been able to see some of my favorite combo finishers from kingdom hearts 2. Default form is unintersting.Combat is over-saturated with team combos, special finishing moves that become available once you attack a marked enemy, a special ability to shoot enemies with 24 rays of light, summons that do damage but also top off everyone's health, and useless dashing combos that can be used to use a special combo by jumping off a wall, but bad camera angles mean you'll almost never be able to accurately aim at anything.Do yourself a favor and buy a remake of Kingdom Hearts 2, and avoid this disappointment at all costs!"
3115,3,"Complete let down all around from this game, and increased ten fold thanks to the insane wait for the game to finally be released.The complete lack of any interesting post game content or even a reason to get Ultima Weapon. Exclusion of any Final Fantasy characters. An extremely shallow combat system that revolves around spamming disney extraction rides, Keyblades that change all of your abilities and make the majority of your equipped base abilities pointless. Terrible story conclusion to the Xehanort 'arc', and I mean truly terrible. Sora is still the most naive and braindead character which was fine back when he was like 12 in KH 1, now he just comes off as a moron with complete lack of common sense.I don't even know if a 'Final Mix' could redeem this piece of garbage thanks to the base combat system being so bloated with annoying disney attraction moves and keyblade mechanics. I don't see how you could turn that model into something remotely strategic and interesting.If this game was a random game Square released instead of being a looong anticipated installment in a series it might warrant a 2 or 3 star rating. But when you compare it to the games in the series that came before it, it clearly missed the mark by a very long margin. It's not likely this is something new for Square since the quality of their games have plummeted since FFX in my opinion."
3116,2,"This is an absolute disgrace. If you are a fan of Kingdom Hearts, grew up with it, and played every kh game there is to play you will absolutely hate this. The game fools you into thinking it is decent or has a chance to get better after the first lackluster world but then NOTHING happens. In both KH1 & KH2 events had impact, here you are looking through an entire 20 hours with nothing of any importance happening all only for everything to be rushed at the last 3 hours of the game. This story is terrible even going in having played all the handhelds and knowing what the story is SUPPOSED to be. But here the plot is so nonexistent you'll wonder what was the point of it all? There are multiple worlds that are large and yet are somehow completely empty. Few moments of story to go along with these worlds and as you play it you will almost feel as though they barely spent 2 weeks on making them. Then the combat is terrible and repetitive. No special abilities because they are all locked behind situation commands. Drives are gone, limits are gone, stuff just happens and the RPG aspect of a supposed ARPG game is gone. You have no strategy nor depth to what you can do. This is not Kingdom Hearts....I don't know what this is. But this is something that does not deserve to be praised. I am shocked that KH3 was this bad."
3117,3,"This game was announced at the end of Kingdom Hearts II, back in 2006. It took 13 years -- two and a half console generations -- to release this game.Unlike KH I and II, you don't really interact with the disney worlds. You won't fight a bunch of cards Alice in Wonderland style or square off against Jafar. You're going to fight the same mooks world after world. Mooks, mind you, that are unrelated to the story you're engaged in. You aren't integral to the stories of the worlds you visit. You're just watching a clip show that would end the same way with or without you.Everything about this game has been streamlined to the point of idiocy. The nuance of KHII's combat with it's reversals and situational countermoves has been replaced with mashing the X button. And I hope you like cut scenes, because they're usually stacked two or three deep. Run in a straight line for 10 seconds. Two or three more cut scenes.Teen angst has always been part and parcel to the Kingdom Hearts experience, but they've really turned it up to eleven.They've removed all of the Final Fantasy characters, and they've followed in Disney's recent tradition of pretending nothing before 2005 exists. If you're reading this, there's a good chance you're young enough to be nostalgic about things that happened in 2012. I'm not, because I was part of the target demographic when the game came out in 2002. I don't mind waiting a long time for something good. But don't hastily cut and paste your original characters over the top of a disney world they don't meaningfully interact with and pretend it's my fault that it seems off from previous entries.The decimal releases should have been an indicator. They've been putting in a fractional effort for years. Still, it's disappointing to see it."
3118,3,"I really wanted to like this game since I have been a fan since the N64 version but there are so many flaws I don't know how this happens to such a large name title from Nintendo. The biggest flaw is online which was a big selling point. It is AWFUL, Nintendo do still had not learned how to make a decent online game and is about 14 years behind everyone else, the bad coding mixed with horrible input lag makes the game sluggish. Why am I forced to pay for an online subscription when the game connects of a p2p network and every match is filled with lag to the point where it is not even enjoyable. Not to mention when you set your settings for 1v1 preferred matches you never get what you want and are then put into FFA lagfests. You can go to the arena mode but all that is just a waiting in line simulator when you have more than 2 people in a room. Why can you not switch your characters after a match? There are so many things wrong with this game it makes me worried for Nintendo. There are many more problems that have not been noted."
3119,1,This game is absolutely lacking in logic and extremely frustrating to play. Do not recommend. Unfair to the player and biased towards CPU. Has too much nerdy lingo going on to comprehend and remarkably complicated to be marketed as a children’s game. I have to record the gameplay and rewatch just to understand what has happened to be defeated and still am often left bewildered and red in the face.
3120,3,"Choosing for glory or for fun was crucial as it didnt force you to play with people who simply wanted to play the game casually online.Now we must set online preferences and hope we get an opponent with a similar set-up. Not only will you be in matches you didnt agree to be in, but they'll likely be free for all or 1v1 matches with ridiculous and different preferences each match......How does that make the online experience better for anyone?"
3121,2,"Where do I start... I have ordered all of my Nintendo Switch games from Amazon, all so far have been great. I have a solid collection of 13 physical games which arrived on the release date (and a day sooner on one instance with Xenoblade Chronicles 2). This is a first for me, I didn't receive any updates on shipping beyond the first couple locations it visited, and nothing for it being out for delivery or shipped. What ever, no biggy. I went to get the mail just to check if it was there and it was. I went back into my house excited to play the new Smash, hastily taking off the rapping which was loose, I was able to rip it right open with a single finger but I have had games like that so I didn't pay attention to that. I took my current game out of my Switch and put it away then I finally got around to opening the box and. no game. it was empty. nothing in it. Like I said, I have ordered a lot of my switch games from Amazon when I was preordering because of the good deal that it was. They no longer do that so I have no reason to go on ordering my games from Amazon especially saying how I paid $55 for a piece of plastic with a colorful pallet that is pleasing to the eyes. I am going to attempt getting a refund but I highly doubt that I can in a situation like this. I just want to play Smash. Thank you."
3122,3,"It's great they included all the characters but they got rid of half the game. No Stage Builder. No break the targets. No Home run Contest. No For Glory Mode online. (The only one people care about) I bought the switch for this game and feel miserably let down. It seems like where it matters, they got rid of more than they added. Stage Builder was my personal favorite and For Glory was the only mode I played in Smash 4. This is the first time I've seen Nintendo mess up this bad."
3123,3,"I'm enjoying seeing Yellow Version is semi-good graphics. That's about it. There is not challenge. You'll NEVER feel a worry that our Pokemon are about to be beat. It is so, so easy. There is very few battles compared to the originals as well. You get experience by catching Pokemon rather than fighting. There are gym and trainer battles, but like I said before, you'll mop the floor with every one you meet.It's fun to see updated graphics (The switches graphics are not all that great though), however, the game is a massive let down because of how boring/easy it is."
3124,2,"Overall, I was really excited to get this game. I had played all of the gameboy pokemon games throughout my childhood and only dreamed about playing the pokemon game on my TV or on the go with such a big vibrant screen.After playing it for two days now, I am pretty disappointed by it. The wild pokemon encounters don't actually let you battle the pokemon. Instead, you just spend the next 2 minutes of your life flicking your wrist repeatedly until you catch the dumb pokemon. While I was annoyed with this, I thought that it may be fun for my 5-year-old to try out. After about 10 minutes, however, he was bored with the game mechanics of repeatedly catching pokemon as well. How hard is it to just provide the ability to battle wild pokemon as well as catch them?Its also extremely easy to level up your pokemon. If you catch a wild pokemon all of your pokemon get a decent amount of XP. Within about an hour of playing, I had a bunch of random pokemon caught and all of the main pokemon in my party were around lvl 12. Very little battling occurred to get me to that point, though, and instead, I just had 8 different metapods and other duplicate random pokemon caught and stored. So dumb.Overall, if you enjoy wasting your time on a game that requires no skill at all and very little fun, buy this game. As for me, I am probably going to return it as it was expensive at launch with very little fun to be had.Instead of having an emphasis on training your pokemon and leveling up, you can now pet your Pikachu. Its fun for about 2 seconds and then you will probably never do it again. you also get to put dumb clothes on your Pikachu. Fun for about 2 seconds, and then you stop caring altogether.Also, you can't even use the pro controller with this, another annoyance as sometimes trees and things will get your way but due to the controller limitations, you cannot swivel the camera around.What a giant mistake and miss Nintendo has with this game. There was so much potential to have the perfect pokemon game due to the rich console screen, nice hardware, etc. Instead, we have a game that feels to be trying really hard to be terrible and does not deliver at all. No one wants to catch 10 of the same pokemon. No one really cares that they can pet their pokemon. No one really cares that they can dress up their pokemon. Whoever was overseeing this project/game literally did their best to ruin such a promising game on such a promising platform.I will be looking to return the game as it simply is not fun. What a waste of my life, time, and money."
3125,3,"Bought this game expecting a remake of Pokemon Yellow with the optional ability of using a pokeball accessory and Pokemon Go if I felt the need although I had no intention of using any of the Pokemon go features.Booted it up, graphics looked great and was pleased until I quickly found out they stripped one of the BASIC pillars of Pokemon - grinding, battling wild Pokémon and levelling up your team. You are forced to run around and just capture Pokemon and battle trainers. I can't run in the grass and level my team.This game is a wasted opportunity, Pokemon Go could have been a nice bonus but instead they've stripped out core components of the game in favor of the dumbed down version of Pokemon Go. I don't know why they couldn't have just given us the option of both.Returning this, not going to entertain this watered down shell of a game and Ill wait for a true Pokemon."
3126,1,"Putting aside cutting ability, breeding, wild pokemon battles, held items, $40 Mew paywall, assuming modern kids are more stupid to make the game super easy, etc, this game is still a disgusting cash grab because of several reasons:1. There are only 151+2 pokemon....(Gotta Catch 'Em All? Impossible! poor Lance, you can only use seadra since it cannot evolve)2. lagging problem especially if you use lure in virdian forest. Really hard to believe after 3ds age, GF still has lagging problems on NS console.... (GF tech skills number one!)3.The post game content is the shortest ever since the NDS age...(kids now like mobile games, they do not spend time on a console game, so no need to make post game contents!)Also, beating the 151 pokemon masters is the most boring post game content ever... What is the fun of raising a metapod to a high level and make it pound another metapod...... I was thinking that GF might design some minigames for pokemon like metapod, magikarp, and ditto. I really overestimated GF.....4.Many moves are cut in this game, including dragon dances, aura sphere, etc. Other than the moves in gen 1, less than half of the original moves survived in this game. ( a dragonite and gyarados cannot learn dragon dance, a mew two cannot learn aura sphere and psystrike... that is ridiculous)5. Many people are aware that ability, wild pokemon battles and held items are cut, but that's not all!No weather, no fishing, no games in the casino game corner (some people might argue about the gambling law forces them to cut it blablabla... but keep in mind, in HGSS, GF designed a new game to replace the casino game in the game center. But in this game, they just cut it...). Also , no day/night cycle ( children should not play at night, parents will be worried!)6. Even though there are only 151+2 pokemon in this game, the pokemon models still have no improvements since pokemon X and Y. It has been 4 years, GF still makes no effort to improve the models (Blatoise, can you at least shoot hydro pump from your cannons instead of from your forehead?)7. Despite annual subscriptions, there are even less online features than before. (wonder trade, GTS,battle spot? Cut cut cut!!!)8. Many new fans might say they really like interacting with their partner pokemon. But in USUM, you can play with more than 800 pokemon rather than with only one partner pokemon.......Some people might argue: we have told you haters many times! This game is not a main series game and the game for your hardcore fans is coming in 2019! However, Matsuda has said several times in interviews that this is a main series game.........He obviously wants hardcore fans to consider it as a main series game and accept it, but I do not think it works out. A good game, such as Odyssey and Zelda, can keep its hardcore fans happy while attracting new fans. If a game causes a huge division between hardcore fans and new coming fans, that game cannot be considered successful.Also, with less pokemon and a smaller map without sevii island, the game content is even less than FRLG, a game from more than 10 yrs ago. The step back is really disappointing. Since 3ds age, the post game content has been extremely poor comparing to nds games. GF has been stepping back for several year and this game demonstrates that the stepping back is still ongoing. (However, critics like IGN and Famitsu will like it since they can beat the elite four and champion easily and give a quick review. It really makes their job much easier.) In the previous nds games, both hardcore fans and new fans can enjoy the game. Hardcore fans can challenge themselves by playing in Battle Frontier or PWT and new fans can just beat the game and put it away. However, this game totally gives up hardcore fans by removing the most contents without adding any new thing for them.At last, pokemon is about adventure, battling, and collecting. For fans loving adventure, there is not any new city and island on the map to explore with the small original Kanto map. For fans loving battling, the battling is too simple to be fun without abilities and held items. For fans loving collecting, there are only 151+2 pokemon to collect. The game deserves the criticism around it."
3127,2,"so as ive been playing this game i have been finding odd performance issues and there are changes to the way you please this game as compared to the original that dont make a whole lot of sense to me.i even tried to play my game with the joy cons off the console and this somehow triggered two player mode, no explanation, just did it and i have no idea how to turn it off.... and now i have this second player that gets teleported to my area of the game whenever i get to far away.also i know theyre trying to make this game pretty but the animations take way too long, holy moly why cant there be a way to shorten this out....i dont like that they force you to capture pokemon instead of fighting them like in the original to capture them. i dont want to capture every pokemon i see just so i can gain experience....thats not to say that this isnt a good game im just not ok with the changes and i wont be playing it any longer."
3128,1,"These guys sent me a European/Australian copy of the game!!!!!!! This blocks the chance for me to get downloadable content. Absolutely disgusting. I cannot comprehend the amount of disappointment I have felt when I realized this. Of course, it was a marvelous game, but in fact there no point in me finishing it as I cannot access the downloadable content. You will be hearing from me again in the near future. Absolutely unacceptable and disgusting once again."
3129,1,"First of all, the game was AMAZING. However I was sent the EU version of the game and I live in the US. So like everyone else I expected to get the US version of the game. However the game came with a sticker saying it played in English and I went along with it. Game played fine, until this week I purchased the DLC. Now I cannot use the DLC because it is region locked and the disc of the game I have is from EU while the DLC is US and they are not compatible. And as DLC is a digital purchase I can’t just get my money back for that either. So beware purchasing discs from here!!"
3130,3,"Purchased this for my little brother for his birthday, when it arrived I found out it's actually the European version. Normally this wouldn't be that big of a deal because the PS4 does not region lock games, but YOU CANNOT buy DLC for the game in the PSN store. You know what that means? You are losing the potential to play countless hours of extra content and enjoyment. Also the subtitles for the game are not in English, so if you are some one who needs assistance with hearing guess what you're out of luck."
3131,2,"I purchased the game brand new from Amazon, and then purchased the DLC pack from the PlayStation Store. I downloaded the DLC but couldn’t get it to install. I’ve been searching the internet trying to figure out why it wouldn’t install, even deleting the entire game and reinstalling. Finally, I found a YouTube video that showed all of the common issues preventing DLC from downloading. It showed how to look up the CUSA code to see where the disc originated. After googling the code, I see that the disc is from the EU and that’s why I can’t install the DLC. Why would Amazon sell this disc in America? Disappointed. The return window has passed so I have to go buy another game to play the DLC. I feel cheated. I buy my games through Amazon, but now I have to re-evaluate that process."
3132,1,"The game is beautiful and the story is great. However, Amazon sent me a European version, living in the US I cannot install and play the DLCs. Read the other one star review, big fubar on their part. The game they advertise is the US version but if you receive the version shown in the photo (notice the different rating) it will not work with anything from the PlayStation US site so buyer beware. You will have to purchase a US version and reinstall the whole game if you want to play the DLCs. If you don’t care for DLCs then enjoy whatever version they send. Quality control is overrated anyway."
3133,3,Never received the game or game system the return request now I’m doing taxes just shows it wasn’t processed and also this game was the only other item but there’s no place to request refund. I’m just sick or everything being hit or miss or broken. Had to select a star but even one isn’t accurate it should be zero!!
3134,1,"How the hell are there all the great reviews. This is supposedly one of the best games of all time? What a joke. You run around aimlessly wondering what the hell to do and where the hell to go. You have to keep going to look at youtube videos almost constantly or you'll never progress at certain points. While you're trying to fight a boss your weapons keep breaking. You have to stop in the middle of the battle to replace them and then eat f'ing food to replenish your hearts. Then if the boss doesn't beat you with one almighty strike the view is terrible and has you in the wrong direction. By the time you find your bearing and face the boss again it's time for another almighty strike and your either dead or down to almost no power. There's so many buttons to do different things that are needed at certain times you can never keep track. So you hit the wrong button and guess what?? That's right another almighty one shot strike that almost or does completely end your life again. I got so mad I twisted the controller. i wanted to chew on it and swallow it so I could poop it out later on. At certain points it's basically impossible to make it to certain area's without special clothing, powers or weapons. And there's no way you'll ever find out how to obtain these things without again differing to youtube videos. Unless you want to play this game for decades, then maybe you'll figure some of this bs out on your own. You have to have lengthy and stupid conversations with other characters (with words on the screen and ridiculous gestures) over and over and over until you just want to drop dead on the spot with frustration. I'm an older gamer and maybe it's just me, this isn't the Nintendo games of old that for sure. They were almost magical when you played them and so much fun. This game is not fun at all. It's intriguing and you want so much to see what happens next. It's a vast world and so many interesting things you can do. Unfortunately it's so frustrating that it's not fun at all. I keep getting tempted to pick up the controller and try to play through a level or boss. Sometimes I cave in and give it another try only to find the same thing....wanted to bust the system, controller and everything in the house. Then left with emptiness, depression and anger that lingers for an hour or so after. Bad bad bad bad bad!!!!!"
3135,1,"I don't understand what all the hype is about over this game. I have been playing it for awhile and I hate it, for various reasons. First, it's an open world game with no sense of direction that I've found. Everything is so vague and there's no way you will figure out this game without consulting the internet for QnA and walkthroughs. One thing I absolutely HATE when trying to play a game. When I want to play a game, I don't want to have to keep stepping away from the screen to go log on my computer to figure out... what do I do next? Where do I go? How do I make this recipe?For example, in the very beginning, you need to complete 3 trials in 3 shrines. Well that's all fine and dandy, except the 3rd shrine is located atop a mountain that is cold. You can't get there without some way to keep yourself warm. I wandered around this area countless hours until I finally by luck stumbled upon some old diary that said something about making a recipe that keeps you warm. Who would have known? You will have no idea until you stumble upon this isolated small shack and find the diary. But doesn't give you the recipe!!! You have to figure it out on your own because the stupid old man wrote the diary forgot the final recipe and it's up to you to figure that out. Yeah good luck with that. The first ingredient is peppers which you can find and pick. The 2nd recipe is raw meat. which takes quite awhile to figure out how to even find. You have to wander around some more until you find some boars in a forest to kill. As for the 3rd ingredient, you will be a week putting together all sorts of different combinations to find the 3rd is a fish. You have no way of figuring this out unless you get on the internet and look it up.I spent hours and hours just wandering around in this game figuring out what I'm supposed to do. I cannot STAND games like that. Just wander around until by luck you stumble upon something related to your quest. At which point, you need to blindly wander around some more.I don't know about the people who wrote the positive reviews, but I have a life. I have a job, I have a family and a home. What I DON'T have, is countless hours to wander around doing nothing. Hours and hours and hours trying to figure out where the shrines are and how to make some stupid recipe that you have to guess on your own. And this is only the beginning of the game. I don't even want to think about what it's like in the later levels.Now that that's out of the way, my other complaint is about the weapons. You have sticks, swords, spears, bows, clubs all sorts of weapons. Cool right? Except they are all junk. After you kill a couple of goblins, the weapon breaks. In the middle of a fight and all of a sudden, your sword has broken!!! Then you have to fart around the menu to equip another sword. You swipe it a few times and oops! It's broke too! Let's try the club. Broke! Equip the spear. Broke!!! I'm tired of hoarding swords and spears in my bag because they keep breaking. And your SOL if they all break. Yeah you can't fight without a weapon. Link just looks at his empty hand like he's stupid. Just ball up your fist and punch the goblin in the face or kick him where it counts. Nope he just looks at his hand. So what do you do when you break all your weapons? You guessed it. Run away. Then you have to waaaaaander around blindly until you stumble on an axe or something. Same with the bows. They break too.And what happens during a boss fight? SAME THING. You dodge his attack and mash him a round then your weapon breaks and he has hardly any damage done at all. But then you have to go to the menu and equip another weapon. In the meantime, by the time that's done, hes coming in for a other attack. Same sequence. Dodge, attack, weapon breaks, replaced. But when he hits you ONCE, its game over and you have to continue and sit through the load screen. Not to mention the music is freaking pathetic and annoying.Weapons breaking, constantly healing after one hit, This is incredibly stupid to have to do when you are in the middle of an intense fight where you need to focus on what your doing rather than mess around swapping out weapons that keep breaking.Forget this. Going to game stop tomorrow to trade this in. I don't have time for this kind of garbage. I bought a Nintendo switch just for this game, because I read it was a good game. Looks like I'm putting the switch away and hooking my PS4 back up and put back in my latest Final Fantasy game, where at least my weapons don't break, I don't die in one hit and I have some sort of sense of direction and what I'm supposed to do.Fing garbage. I want my money back. For game AND the switch. Nintendo can suck it."
3136,3,"Boring. Its a game that incentives you not to play it. Get a good weapon, it breaks, you dont want to use it. Food you make it, want to save it for something else, dont use it. Climbing up a tower like the ladder in a much better game MGS2. Boring boring boring. The lack of music and costumes at the beginning is disappointing. Mario Odyssey definitely deserves GoTY wayyyyyy more."
3137,1,"This. Game. BLOWS. The controls are completely unintuitive and overly sensitive. The damage dealt is inconsistent. Too many abilities to keep straight.... Zelda was SO much better when it was more simplistic. You had a sword, you had a shield, and you had an interchangable utility. Now you don't get a sword, you just pick up whatever's nearby, swing it & pray it doesn't break! You can summon remote detonated bombs? Crouch? Use some kinda magnetic magic? It's gone from fantasy adventure to some kinda SciFi post-apocalyptic future adventure?! You have stamina to worry about?! You can craft meals? The physics are all f'd up.... Guys. Less is MORE. I've never been put off by a Legend of Zelda game before. It started heading that way with Twilight Princess and now... it's just not even Zelda anymore. I wish I'd had a demo to check out first before blowing so much money on this.... How it has 4.8 stars is beyond me. If you like Zelda, don't get this. If you don't care about Zelda, are somewhat self-masochistic and want something different, you might like it."
3138,2,"Just horrible. The graphics are good and so is the story. The gameplay, which is what you’ll be doing with.... a game, is cringe worthy. You can’t jump. Like literally. You see a ledge, you can’t jump on or off it, and the menus feel elementary, like they were a school project. Refinement is not what you’ll get here. After about six hours I couldn’t take it anymore."
3139,3,"I know millions have played the game. I can't apparently. And from what I'm experiencing, I dont' know how people have managed to. Since putting a web link will probably get this deleted, search for ""God of War 2018 Launches to Black Screen then Crashes when Attempting to close application"" and you should find the EU playstation forums post regarding this. Now, instead of typing alot, I'm just going to copy what I sent Sony, SonySantamonica, and Cory Balrog in a tweet...""This EXACT problem is happening to me as in that link from the EU forums... Happened last month, and just (today) I bought a 2nd NEW copy of God of War. Same thing happened today. I start the game, the splash screen comes up, then nothing, just a black screen to infinity (I let it go on for half an hour once, nothing loaded). I have to hit the PS button back to the PS4 menu, close application, but then instead of just closing, i get the same error code mentioned in that forum post as well. I report the error (or not) then it goes back to the PS4 menu. Same thing happened today with another new copy from best buy (last month was from gamestop). Except instead of getting an error screen w/code, it went back to a black screen and the console was COMPLETELY unresponsive. I had to unplug it, then wait for disk checks after turning it back on.I have a launch style ps4 (touch buttons), my other 40 or so disc based games work (however someone in that forum thread said the digital version had the same issue), already tried them all (AFTER being forced to unplug it, console's still fine). If it matters, I can't use HDR either. I have a sony bravia tv from 2012 (after a lightning bolt fried my 1000 dollar CRT from sony, the last one they made i think, that silver one). I saw one article online that said you NEED HDR to play God of War, I'm hoping that was just bad wording and they meant it's better in HDR... I have NEVER in my life bought a game that was literally unplayable. And as I said, my other 40 games work fine. It's not my console, I don't need to format it and reinstall the OS, my other 40 games load fine. I have the latest OS and game updates (it installed 1.33 for GoW when i installed it again today, it was 1.32 when i tried this last month). Please fix this, I don't buy games to use them as drink coasters...""If anyone actually knows what the hell is going on and can help me fix this I'd really appreciate it, and I'll update this review, or just delete it till I actually play the game. But as of now it's unplayable period. @AskPlaystation on twitter wanted to send my to sony chat (which doesn't even work, the page just keeps reloading when I hit request chat), but there's nothing wrong with my console. They would have me try another copy of the game, or rebuild the database, or even wipe the hard drive and reinstall the OS. OR send the console in for repairs it doesnt' need. That's pointless.... 40 other games I just tried one by one load fine...Update Feb 2018: I talked with the actual devs via twitter for days, they're clueless and cant' figure it out. They even gave me a digital code, that did the same thing. I bought a new, better hard drive for my ps4. When it got here, I wiped the one I was using, reinstalled the OS, and did nothing else but install GoW. Same thing.... put in the new drive, installed the OS, installed GoW.... same thing. Looks like I'm stuck watching someone else play it on YouTube... hell when the PS5 releases, if it's at least backwards compatible with PS4 games, maybe I can play it on there."
3140,3,"I can only be grateful I didn't buy a PS4 for this game. Many have called it mature... dark... even-paced. I call it boring, repetitious, overly linear and annoying (and not just the kid is annoying).The combat is very boring. It takes forever to kill a few enemies. Sure there are techniques to do so quicker... but it's a sluggish mess to do so. It's clearly taken from the Dark Souls franchise. Where is the God of War I played years ago? Even the first boss battle was a huge disappointment. I barely received damage on it... it just took forever. Once you learn to time shield block, well... time to punch...The levels are slow and linear. You walk in a line... then you see a chest... then you loot the chest... then you continue... your son runs up a cliff, lets down a chain... then you climb the chain... then you keep walking in a straight line again.What is likely the most frustrating and annoying thing is that the over the shoulder camera blocks enemies to the front left of you. I can't tell you how many hits I receive because the damn camera is blocking everything. Well you can move the camera up a bit, but then you can't throw your axe... which is a core mechanic of the game...No... no... what is even more annoying is how I am running at an enemy I need to kill first, but then my camera latches on to another enemy as I am sprinting toward my foe... now I get shot in the back by the enemy I wanted to originally target.No... no... no... what is even more annoying is the darn kid. I thought Kratos-dad told him to shut up? Why am I baby-sitting this kid in a video game anyhow? I'll never know... I've long since put this game down... why didn't I buy a physical copy to resell it? Oh that's right... it's the triple A title I thought HAD to be good..."
3141,3,I guess i recieved the european version of the game because the my ps4 made a seperate save file and now i have to versions of god of war on my console. Meaning i have to pass the whole game again just so i can try the new game plus!!! I ordered the game just for this and now i cant do that!!!!
3142,3,"Gameplay: They replaced a fast-paced, intense hack and slash gameplay from 1-3, with an excruciatingly slow, bad rip-off dark souls gameplay. Instead of taking on a dozen enemies at the same time and feeling powerful (original trilogy), you have to slowly hack a single enemy with a stupid ax, practically one at a time, and now they can sneak up on you because the camera is horribly fixed behind you. Or you can throw an ax over and over again...and over again... Taking down enemies feels tedious and like a chore, not a blast like it was in the original trilogy. Also, roughly 1/3 of the gameplay is a walking simulator.Story: The forced story with the son narrative is derivative, and entirely unoriginal. It's such a blatant copy off Last of Us, with much inferior emotional impact. It just feels weak, and is full of long scenes you can't skip, where you get to watch Kratos play dad (yawn).Kratos: Instead of a badass angry God who runs around and destroys everything in his path, Kratos in this game walks slowly through long traila and cannot jump. The kid follows around and provides really annoying commentary. I kept wishing there was an option to let the kid die, play a stupid crying cut scene, and then be rid of him the rest of the game. Not an option, so you get to be Kratos: ""God of Babysitting.""Originality: There is almost nothing original about this game. The gameplay has a much inferior copy of dark souls and bloodborne play style. The story is a bad version of last of us. The recallable ax is a blatant copy off Thor's hammer from the Marvel movies. In the original series, Kratos was an original, angry, and powerful character who was fun to play as--not anymore.The developers turned Kratos into a wimpy character, and they went to the press virtue signaling about how ""deep"" the game was.It wasn't deep and it was a tiresome, tedious, chore to play. After playing this I had to put in God of War 3 and whoop on its awesome bosses, just to take out my frustration from them ruining such a great character and series.Real Kratos would want revenge for seeing what these guys did to him in this game. ""My vengeance ends here!"" (real Kratos in God of War 3)."
3143,2,"I was so excited to get this game but after over 15 hrs I decided to give up (20% progress). Every time when I thought to give up due to frustration, I told myself maybe I need a little bit more time to get used to it. NOW, I THINK IT IS THE TIME !!!Pro: pretty good graphics (but not amazing), beautiful landscape.Con:1. Boring and tedious. As a game, it is supposed to give gamer fun, right? I played RDR1, GTA5, Horizon zero dawn, assassin creed: origin, the witcher 3: wild hunt. god of war etc and I enjoyed them a lot. But for RDR2, i didn't have that feeling. I lost interest very quickly and I don't even remember when is the last time I had this feeling. It is a Big Failure for RDR2 !2. Terrible health setting! I need to eat, my horse too, otherwise, the health will go down. Bad ideal ! Not fun!3. No fast /easy travel, have to ride the horse and go a long distance. Not fun !4. Clunky movement, especially when you move Arthur in a house or at camp. he moves like a very old man. Not fun!5. Boring shooting and fighting. Not fun.6. Boring main missions and side missions. Not fun.I am glad it decided to give up and now I have time to play others games !!!"
3144,3,"Extremely disappointing. It's the video game equivalent of The Phantom Menace.Red Dead 1 is an amazing game. I expected the sequel to be at least as good as the original. Instead we have this heap of trash. If I knew the game would be this, I wouldnt have bought it.The first thing you'll notice is the confusing and frustrating controls. For instance if one is on a horse, and spots prey, or gets into a fight, you'll instinctively pull the left trigger to aim whatever weapon you selected. Except now that's not what happens. Now you have to aim, then elect to draw your weapon, then fire. And most of the time it won't pick out weapons you want. Way too many steps when you're panicking because someone's shooting at you.They also took away essential features, such as fast travel. You also have to remember to grab your weapons off your horse before stopping. It's difficult to predict what a control input is going to end up doing. The whole game is extremely frustrating. I've played it for several days, and I'm still waiting for it to be fun.The magic of Red Dead 1 is gone. There are some improvements here, but really it's just the same game with a different setting, more drudgery, less fun, lazier plot, and frustrating controls."
3145,2,"Want to play a western game where you are bossed around by women who lower their voice and try to add some growl into it? Want to play the most historically inaccurate game ever made? Want to be killed over and over by the law simply because you try to get on your horse instead to have your character run far over to some random NPC and grab him to get wanted by the law and get a bounty over and over? Want to play a game where politically correct agendas are constantly shoved down your throat? If yes than this is for you!Great graphics, horrid controls. This game makes Native Americans look awful. When you think you are finally rid of these horrid characters and you play as John you have them show right back up so you don't forget the agenda! Feminism everywhere!I will NEVER buy another Rockstar game."
3146,3,"Considering all the praise being heaped on this game. I was very suprised at how unenjoyable an experince it has been. It has a lot of problems. The biggest is just being flat out boring. I've played 5 hours and there has been nothing to hook me in. Just boring, slow, emptiness. Now I thought that Octopath Traveler had a boring story (which it does) but there are other redemptive parts of that game like the combat. The gun play here is trash. Considering uncharted is 3rd person coverbased they should have just copied that and saved on the 100hr work weeks. This is being hailed as the next step forward. With that in mind I have to compare it to a game that was the next step forward The Witcher 3. Within 5 hours of starting The Witcher I was having a blast from the combat to a compelling story and world. Red Dead 2 has none of this and while there are many technically inferior games they have some redemptive quality. Red Dead has no redemption. I feel jipped by not only Rockstar but also by all the mainstream reviewers who have done nothing but heap praise on this heap of boring hyperbole."
3147,3,"I'm simultaneously glad to see many others having the same opinion of RDR2 as I did, that it's probably the most over hyped game of the past 5-10 years, but disheartened to see 99% of ""critics"" and game/entertainment related web sites gush embarrassingly over it and claim it's a ""Masterpiece"" and ""the best RPG of this generation consoles.""Fist of all... NO, it's NOT a masterpiece. Not by a long shot. Yes the game is beautifully rendered and realistic but at the same time, it's bleak and barren; yes I suppose there's a lot of quests to do but so far they're VERY repetitive. I've played about 15 hours so far and it took forever to get through the intro and the main tutorials. The story so far is really a snooze fest and I'm having a hard time feeling any bonding with any characters and any drive to continue this story. There are way too many cut scenes and dialogues are way too long and just meaningless fluff.I agree with many who say the map is just massive... but this is not a good thing like it is in Witcher 3: Wildhunt or God of War or Horizon: Zero Dawn. It literally takes forever to get from one main story interaction to another on your horse. In between is a beautiful landscape but completely void of anything interesting which makes it tedious. Yes there are some side quests to find and places to discover off the main route but from what I've experienced so far a LOT of the map is simply nothing... just pretty landscape.Yes, I realize I've only played about 15 hours but that's more than enough time for a game to grab my attention, get me interested in the game, the story, the controls and gameplay and start to have emotional investment in it AND especially the characters. RDR2 does none of that and I frankly don't want to wait around to see if that happens.I've decided there exists a massive disconnect with these so-called ""critics"" and actual, TRUE gamers definition of a ""masterpiece"" gaming experience. For critics it appears... especially with RDR2... all they seem to care about is a beautiful, realistic landscape, anticipation with waiting years for a previously fantastic game to come out with a sequel and more story and cut scenes than actual game play. This is more like an interactive movie, not a game. I've concluded either Rockstar paid off a LOT of reviewers to give RDR2 10/10 ratings or most of them simply aren't true gamers and don't fully understand what most gamers want and respect out of a game and what really constitutes a masterpiece. Sorry but a beautiful landscape that looks absolutely real isn't enough to give a game a great score. Games have been rendered amazingly realistic for years now and it's almost expected. This seems to be the main accolade for most of the reviews I've read online.You know what an RPG Masterpiece is? God of War. Horizon: Zero Dawn. And what I consider to be the best game ever made: The Witcher 3, Wild Hunt. The Witcher has a massive map and sometimes takes you a while to get from one quest point to another but in between is not only the most realistic landscape you can imagine but stuff to explore and discover at every step of the way, under every rock and behind every bush. Not only that, CD Projekt Red was somehow able to create the most dynamic and LIVE world I've ever seen in a game. Cities are flowing with real side interactions, voices, sounds and animations. I sometimes think the sounds in the game are coming from outside my house. The towns, cities and open space in The Witcher 3 is ALIVE... more alive than any game I've ever played. RDR2 doesn't even come close. Hell, I liked Assassin's Creed: Origins way better than this borefest.I'm giving this game one star because the review of it here on Amazon should reflect what the game is really like and because it is NOTHING like what so many critics are saying. It's honestly a 6/10 for me. I doubt I'll even finish it. I'd rather get Assassin's Creed: Odyssey or Spiderman with my limited available gaming time. I'm just glad I didn't get the Special or Ultimate editions."
3148,3,Microsoft forces you to register an account to your game in order to play. In order to register you have to have a Microsoft account. In order to have a Microsoft account you have to give them your phone number for..... reasons??If this game was free then I would understand the need to harvest my data to sell off but I paid for this game so having to give off personal information to be able to play is ridiculous.If you don't like invasion of privacy stay away apparently.... What a disappointment.
3149,3,"An extremely poor port. This new version is buggy, lags, and has poor frame rate and huge rendering drops, compared to the traditional console edition. Inventory gets deleted, game crashes, multiplayer chugs. It's a very, very poor port. My advice is to buy the Nintendo Switch Edition of Minecraft on the Eshop, and wait for this port to be fixed (if it ever does [Xbox players have been complaining about this port since it launched back in 2017]). You can buy the eShop version and get a free upgrade to the new ""Minecraft"" edition, that this is. Your old worlds can even be converted over. Though, like I said, this port is extremely buggy and difficult to deal with. Wait till they fix the bugs, then it might be worth it."
3150,3,"I purchased 2 copies of this version of Minecraft to play with my son who lives in another state. After having trouble figuring out how Minecraft was going to work under the Nintendo Online system I went ahead and bought two versions and started fiddling with it. That's when I noticed how poor the system works with 2 big problems.1. The game in theory, will let people (each with their own Nintendo Online account) to play together without using Microsoft Realms. I thought this would be a godsend, but it seems Nintendo hasn't done a great job aligning the features and my son soon realized that you can create a new world and both of us can play on it, but when we log out he can no longer join that server. Doesn't matter if I make the server/world, or if he does, you seem to only get 1 play out of it. I looked at NAT types, I've tried port forwarding, and slew of other things. Nintendo/Mojang support is not helpful either with this problem apparently plaguing other users.2. The game itself is very buggy considering how it seems Nintendo Online handle latency and other issues. I found myself disconnected on a few occasions, or situations where I could no longer see my son's avatar even though he was right in front of me (I witnessed this over facetime). Other issues like landscape (FOV) not appearing seem pretty common in multiplayer.The singleplayer is fine and the controls once you get used to them work great, but the primary reason I got 2 copies of this was so I could play online and that feature is doesn't work. If the problem can be resolved I'll change my review."
3151,3,"You cannot connect to any Minecraft server on the internet, only Microsoft approved servers in a Microsoft curated list (that isn't even enabled yet).You cannot play with other players running Minecraft on computer (java version).You must create/use an XBox account to play the game.You cannot use your existing Minecraft/Mojang account.You cannot customize your skin; only select from already-built versions that Microsoft provides.I bought this so my kids could play their favorite servers from the computer on the Switch, but that's not possible.Microsoft is trying its best to kill the game that Mojang created."
3152,3,"It’s honestly ridiculous they can charge for such a buggy product. This game lags glitches and downright steals my stuff because it can’t stop crashing. Don’t waste your money like I did. I’ve had it freeze when I try to save and when I come back a bunch of my stuff is gone, I’ve been somehow killed by nothing when I come to log back in with all my stuff a good distance away from my home, which I was in when I saved and left. I’ve also had myself and a horse get stuck in nothing and have to quit and come back in to make it work. This game is full of bugs and should be recalled and fixed before it’s sold."
3153,2,I bought the game for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas because it was rated everyone. The music had inappropriate langue ( lots of swear words) and way too much sexual content. We had to get rid of it. We are very disappointed because previous ones were not like this. It need to be rated explicit not everyone.
3154,2,"Our whole family loves to dance, so we bought this game thinking we could all play together (2 adults, 8 year old, 5 year old, 2 year old). There is a kids song section, and a regular adult song section. Most (if not all) of the kids songs are repeated on the adult section, so that's a bummer because you're not getting as many songs as it looks like. If I had known some of the songs that were put on the kids side, I would have never purchased this game. One song on the kids side has lyrics that simply repeat ""sexy me"" over and over again. Once the kids got tired of their songs, we tried to do some of the easy songs on the adult side. The first song we put on had lyrics about ""no longer wanting to be alive, yes I just want to die"". Needless to say, our kids will not be listening to these songs anymore! Nor will they be playing this game without an adult present."
3155,3,Bought game and now to play most songs they want you to buy an upgrade. This is deceptive.I bought the game. I could understand if a year from now there are more songs and it’s costs Ubisoft extra money in licencing fees and so they want to charge for an upgrade (for new content). But out of the box is deceptive pricing.I agree with other users to pay $20 for a demo is ridiculous.
3156,2,I have purchased every just dance game from the first one until this copy. This copy has the worst song track list by far! Half the songs aren’t even in English! The ones that are were relevant at least 5 years ago.The fact that to unlock any songs from prior games requires a subscription monthly at that is awful. I owned every prior game so I should be allowed to have access to all prior songs.The track list for the base game should have came with triple what was included in the game. I think this will be my last just dance game I will ever purchase.
3157,3,"In sum, If you have a younger child that can stand the same songs over and over and over and over and over and over, this game is for you.The base game does not come with a lot of variety. Only two or three easy levels songs and a mix of hard and medium songs. In order to get most fun, you need to have an Ubisoft account. All the features of the game are not unlocked until your ""dance card"" reaches level 6 or 7.The dashboard shows ALL the songs does not give you a way to filter or sort by subscription level to try to filter out the songs that you own from what is on their cloud service.Our youngest keeps trying to play locked songs and then gets bounced to sign up prompts and then gets frustrated by the menu, so it really requires adults to be around to do the driving.Also all avatars, extra songs, at work, etc need to be unlocked by playing. This by itself its not bad, except, the way it is implemented here. When you complete a dance, you are given xp and coins. The xp levels up your dance card and the coins are used to unlock avatars, alternate songs, et al. The coins then are fed into a machine (100 for each attempt) and then you get a random item and each has a chance to be an avatar, alt song, etc. It would be far better to be able to ""buy"" what you want but that does not happen here.If you can get past that, the kids to enjoy the few songs they can dance too and the kids mode is ok. It just doesnt track progress.My older kid is bored already."
3158,1,"Seriously, get the translation of Seiken Densetsu 3 instead. It was prettier and had eight times the story than this one - six characters with intertwining plots and unique dialogue between all members. The Chrono series did it better, too.Like all the critical reviews said, this game is boring. They did every cliche except the managed to do it worse for every single character.I feel insulted by Square Enix. Dressing up garbage in a pretty package and fan loyalty doesn’t make you a smart developer, it makes you a traitor. Their stuff just keeps getting worse and worse. Don’t touch this trash if you want story, intriguing gameplay, or remotely likeable characters."
3159,1,"Update: Stuck 5 days in hospital so I thought I would give this another chance. OMG, it gets worse. I really wouldn't suggest it to anybody but the newest to the genre.I was so excited about this title when I first heard of it, though I was worried the multiple story lines where going to be a hassle from the start, but I was open to the idea.My gamble did not pay off. The stories are very basic, too basic if you ask me. I think it's due to the amount of them, you never get pulled into the ""story"" since there's too many!The game starts off fine, one story line, you get to the point where you have to leave the first town and then go to the next, where you pick up the next party member. This means you have to go through their ""having to leave the town"" story line, and then it just repeats. It gets to a point where you just want to (or do) skip the whole story to get to the boss encounter and get it over with.Traveling between towns is very pretty, but very short, which means you only get 10 minutes rest between another mediocre story line.I really lost interest very quickly, I would not recommend it. Maybe just borrow a friends copy for a day and that should be good enough."
3160,1,"This game is so over praised. The stories are so generic and dull, I couln’t believe it. Them traveling together is so awkward and inorganic, their stories don’t link. Played Primrose first and was shocked at how generic her revenge story is... and this is the best story ( as per everyones words ) ?? It only got worse as I gathered the other generic characters and their stories. I guess this is impressive to the younger crowd that’s not use to playing older games and the wow factor of the 8 bit graphics took such a blinding hold on people. Or people that have never consumed other media. On a side note indie games can better fulfill that need you guys. Battle system is okay but battles can be so long for literally no reason ( ah this game is trying to trick you into thinking it has substance ). I guess I would recommend it if you want a time waster but it’s beyond me the praise this game is getting. I can’t see it being talked about in years to come, it’s nothing special."
3161,3,"Just received my case of Octopath Traveler, yeah case. Opened it up excited to pop it in the switch and no damn game. WTF. So ZERO stars right off the bat. Do not know about game play as I only have the case. Now for the case. The art work is nice. There are no booklets or papers (game either) in the case.Hope you have better luck if you order.."
3162,3,"This game is beyond mediocre. Every class only has a handful of skills, and you just mix and match with the next class. Stories are terrible! For all eight characters! It's not because each of their story aren't interconnected, but mostly they are just all really lame story. The game was really repetitive and lack of depth. I get that everyone trying to send a message that we all still want JRPG, but come on! This game isn't up to any JRPG game's standard. I am upset that I jumped into the hype and wasted 50 hours in this game at the original price."
3163,3,"Sekiro Shadows Die Twice is a beautiful game, with the hint of a pretty cool story that is all but marginalized by ridiculously difficult and repetitive boss fights. It's BORING, there I said it. I apologize to all the five star reviewers of this game because hats off to you; you guys have the time and patience for a game with very little payoff. OR substance just doesn't matter to you... I finally gave up after fighting consecutive guardian ape fights only to have to face that headless jerk again with his wife lol. The whole time I'm thinking to myself when is this going to get fun? When am I going to feel that feeling of awe and accomplishment after a tremendous battle. Or better yet that feeling from a really cool dungeon crawl. Sekiro is just a relentless grind that doesn't go anywhere imo.I love FROM software games. I've played the King's Field games, Shadow Tower, Kuon, Demon's Souls, DS I, II, III, BloodBorne... They were flipping brutal too, However, one glaring difference is the payoff in those games. In each of those franchises the story is immersive, character development was not an after thought, and just the sheer excitement of leveling up finding loot that adds to the character and further entices you into the story and the bizarre, esoteric lore of the game is just reward for the punishing game play. Sekiro, however is just lazy to me. Its just designed to be a ball buster for the sake of it.Okay that doesn't make it a bad game, just different I suppose. But I don't like it. I don't play games as a competitive sport, trying to get some damn ball in a hole or a goal, or whatever. Its just mindless, and If that's the way things are going to be under the Activision umbrella, then that is truly sad.So, I'm really sorry FROM software. Sekiro was a total miss for me. I still love you guys though!"
3164,3,"I've played hundreds of hours of Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1-3 and Bloodborne, but I couldn't put more than 20 on Sekiro. This game just frustrates me and is not very enjoyable. The difficulty is just too much, and exploring isn't rewarding. The lack of leveling or weapon customizations takes a lot of the fun out of it. I could go on but overall I'm just really dissapointed I didn't like this game."
3165,1,"So where to start. This game is hard to impossible to get through even the first level. I would not recommend this game to anyone. I have never seen a game without selectable difficulty levels. There is just one difficulty, ""impossible"". Graphics are decent sound is ok gameplay is horrible R1 to attack, L1 to block. Thats it. No combo moves, no sneaking past to level up. Not open world as advertised. Or if it is, I could not make it past the first 8 goons to open anything up. A real waste of 60 bucks. Only hope now is if the From Software realizes the game is unplayable and will create a patch that eases the difficulty."
3166,3,"There are no options for difficulty levels and you just die over and over. I get it, I suck, but I don't play games that are this difficult as i just want to enjoy the experience. It takes the fun out of it for me which is why I don't play the dark souls games. If I had known it is similar in difficulty I would not have purchased this game, now it's just an expensive coaster."
3167,3,"I was first introduced to From games at Demons Souls' launch. It totally clicked with me, and I've followed all their releases since. I had a lot of anticipation for this one, and while some of the game is deeply engrossing and the world is amazing, Sekiro's broken and rigid combat and boss system overshadows and destroys whatever accomplishments the rest of the game makes.Timing and attack animations are often poor. Deflect and jump, two of your three key combat defenses, are off timing on key mini-bosses and bosses. Enemy animations do not match up with collision.There are multiple bosses that require an hour or two of attempts. At the point you beat them, it's not a great feeling of accomplishment as the cliche goes. Just resentment that From repeatedly puts such cockblocks in what would otherwise be a perfect game.This is the only video game I can ever remember not finishing, that I wanted to finish. Sword Saint is ridiculous. No bigger feeling of disappointment in a game in putting 40 hours in and not being able to finish it."
3168,3,Great game but I've spent more time watching the loading screen than anything. I bought this for playing online with friends and after spending roughly 8 hours trying to play I think I got a total of 2 hours of gameplay. I'd rather just not play this then put up with the stress and frustration of trying to play with friends only to have 10-30 minutes of loading screens.
3169,1,"I very rarely have a problem with a purchase I've made on Amazon but I ordered this game (take 2 interactive) and an xbox live card (from a different seller) and BOTH were defective! The xbox won't even attempt to read the disc most of the time and when it does, I get the ""Your disc is dirty or damaged"" message. The disc is and was brand new and it just won't work on my console. I just tried it on a friends old and ugly original xbox one and it worked fine. I wouldn't recommend buying this for a newer console."
3170,1,"I bought this game for my son a couple weeks ago. He has been wanting this game for a very long time. He finally got it and played all day, he loved it! Next day I wake up and he's in the living room with a sad look on his face, then he tells me that this game that I bought for him doesn't start, he tried reinstalling, which took all day, restarting the console, and resetting his profile, nothing worked, what a shame. Don't buy if you're playing on Xbox One."
3171,1,"In a pretend world they sure pander to the already deranged. the “real” world of vulgarity and unnecessary racist stereotypes and language in a PRETNED WORLD which could be a LITTLE different than the real world. I do not get it. Why would you create a parallel fake city based on some west coast crap-hole when you could set a NEW standard? The N word is offensive and you cannot even PLAY the game in a house of people because THEY get offended. Buy headphones, sit in your room and continue to contribute to the everyday stereotype negative for A GAME that is suppose to give you enjoyment and pleasure and fun AWAY from the real world!! Thought the premise of a game was to make you forget your problems for a little while, like a movie or playing an instrument. LOSER GAME!! People do not even get the indoctrination or the pandering. More parents need to buy this for their 13 year olds!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
3172,3,"Did not work. Literally nearly damaged my xbox trying to take this disc out. Tried cleaning, resetting my xbox, and trying other discs to make sure drive is not error. I have not even had this for 30 minutes and will already have to use MY MONEY to buy a an envelope and drive to a ups location to return this item. Unacceptable."
3173,3,"I purchased Persona 5 as an early Christmas present; 50+ game hours later, the one gifted it still cannot access the game's online add-ons. After an hour of troubleshooting -- reinstalling the game, restoring the profile's licenses, etc. -- I've discovered the copy of Persona 5 is in PAL format, playing on an NTSC profile/system. No matter the option -- refunding Persona 5/buying an NTSC copy of the game, creating a false PAL PS4 Persona 5-only profile, etc. -- the nephew is stuck having to begin a new game to see any in-game add-ons. So, instead, he's opted to keep the game, playing without the added online features, and I've decided to write my first Amazon review. Merry Christmas."
3174,3,"Very few games make me angry enough to write a review right after ""clearing"" the story mode, and this one is definite at the top of that list.Let me explain: the game itself is amazingly designed, although a pretty linear type of RPG. You can read any review on what makes this a good game and those reviews are probably spot on. Here's why I'm giving it a 1-star, though.For a game that lets you make choices, there are a few important places where the choices are so limited that you have to make a choice that you'd never make in real life, or given more options.But even worse, at some point, giving the answer that you might think is the right one (the honest answer) will get your game to come to an abrupt end. A complete game over. Meaning, you'll have to go back, and figure out which answer the developers want you to give. In short, you don't get to give the answers that YOU would want to give.Updated:after going back and changing my answers to (unnamed character), the story moves forward, and they spend a good 10-15 minutes in cut scenes explaining what happened and why it makes sense. Perhaps they'll explain some of the loop holes they've introduced in this turn of events, at a later point..."
3175,1,"Ok so went into this game never playing any of the previous Persona's games (thank goodness) with high hopes of playing a great RPG, what I ended up with was frisbee I destroyed w/extreme hate, lol. So started off playing thinking ""weird but will see"" and after few hours in I was getting very annoyed on how you almost had no options to do anything but read annoying teenager dialog and asinine comments, entire days wasted for doing a single chore like laundry or eating. Then finally you can explore a palace, which was the only thing I found somewhat entertaining. But those little experiences are so far apart between mundane task to mundane task like daily reading, shopping of kissing up to other people or going to bathhouse or making coffee or curry and that list goes on. This was more like a SIMS game than RPG. I found myself hating the characters, being so pissed off by the annoying conversations, but my OCD need to finish made me keep going. Finally after putting up with the massive headaches from all the bright fast colors worthy of causing epileptic fits on anyone and reasons mentioned above I quit playing and currently deciding to either sell or burn. I am a collector, I have never gotten rid of any game, still have all my Nintendo, SNES, gamecube, ps1/2/3/4 Xbox wii/u/switch, handhelds, pc, etc and this is the first to piss me off to get rid of. Sorry for rant and my TLDR summary is this thing SUCKED. I would suggest rent or borrow to see if you can stomach b4 buying."
3176,2,"This is really a movie, not a game. You barely play anything. You just keep hitting a button to see the next line, run around a little (and it's a little klunky) and do a few turn based fights. I never liked JRPG, but there are so many positive reviews from people here to gaming magazines, so I thought maybe they changed. Nope. All these people must have been paid off or drank the same Kool-aid, because this is as boring as can be. As another reviewer (who must also have free will) has said, there is almost nothing to do in this game. It all plays out on the screen and once in a while you get to make a choice in an answer, which probably makes no difference anyway.Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. I blame myself for trying another JRPG game, which really is not a game at all, just like all the others. Yawn."
3177,3,"There are a lot of ways in which this game is less enjoyable than previous installments in the franchise, but the main one for me (the one that ended the game for me) involves one of your team members being molested by another team member as a gag. Essentially, the girl is coerced into being put into an extremely uncomfortable situation and stripping for a creepy artist, the playable character cannot object, and the creepy artist later is welcomed into the group. I felt betrayed by the series (you should never ask a person to go into a situation where they're going to be sexualized against their will, especially if it's dangerous, even if you think you can ""rescue"" them before anything bad happens). I haven't been able to pick it up since."
3178,2,"Bought this game off a whim, and it's definitely not amazing. The combat is very satisfying, but the story is mediocre at best which is to be expected of a warrior game I suppose...Main story took about 10ish hours to complete and finish, but there are still multitudes of history modes that are available to complete as well. Replayability in this game is limited to grinding materials to finish building your favorite heroes or to complete history maps in order to get more master seals in order to promote your heroes. I definitely didn't hate this game but at the same time, this game didn't amaze me either, especially with the hefty $59.99 price tag. I would say spend your money elsewhere if you're not already a large fan of the warrior franchise since this game definitely does NOT play like a regular Fire Emblem game (not that I came in expecting it to, but still)...I think this game might be worth it at 29.99 or so, but definitely not at 59.99."
3179,3,"Fire Emblem ""Warriors"" is not like the other Fire Emblem games in the series, in that it is not a strategy game but a ""hack and slash"" style game. I knew that getting the game, however what I didn't realize was that this game, although made specifically for the ""NEW"" 3DS system does not support 3D. I found that extremely disappointing as I love the 3D aspect of the ""3DS"" and is why I purchased a 3DS over a 2DS.The game itself seems pretty good to me, yet wasn't one I was able to get into. The exploration of the various rooms just didn't seem that interesting to me. I am comparing this to other hack n' slash styled games and I feel there are many that are much better and more interesting."
3180,3,"A bit disappointing.Let me start out by saying that I like musou games, those games that are similar to Dynasty Warriors. I've played a lot of them over the years. This one isn't one of the better ones.The way it imports mechanics from the Fire Emblem series is interesting, but it's ruined by the bizarre imbalanced roster. Instead of taking a wide variety of characters from across the whole series, it takes a large number from the most recent games, and a few from older ones. This wouldn't be too bad, but they also focused almost exclusively on sword-wielding characters. With the weapon triangle fully in effect, it's a bit of a problem.There's another, bigger problem. You bring a large number of characters into each battle with you, and you can command them to move to different parts of the battlefield and attack. In most games of this type, your allies are automatically appropriately strong for the level you're in. But in this game, you have to manage all your allies, since they're all playable, except a few pure NPCs depending on the mission type. But the characters you're not actively controlling are just not very good at fighting. They will fall behind in levels fast, and stay there as they won't be able to defeat enemy officers. Unless you want to methodically go through and level every character individually, grinding appropriate maps along the way, it's a disaster.The game has great production values, and a good amount of content with history mode, but the core gameplay has too many problems. I'd say to wait for Hyrule Warriors if you want a musou on the switch."
3181,1,"Was extremely disappointed with this game. Every level felt the same, smash the same two buttons until the enemy dies. The AI was really bad, found both the enemy and your allies standing around doing nothing. Story wasn't great but entertaining at the very least.Sadly I don't have much good to say about this game. I don't understand the other 5 star reviews. Comparing this to other games that deserve 5 star makes this feel like a phone game.Would not recommend."
3182,1,"I just wasted money on this game, which I am sure they were planning on catching those people who are huge Fire Emblem fans and will buy their games loyally. This is a real time action RPG, NOT a tactical turn based grid game. I can't play games like this, so I got about 15 seconds of playing time before realizing I had been duped. :( Don't make the same mistake I made, or give this as a gift to someone who likes Fire Emblem Games."
3183,1,"I downloaded this on Xbox One on day of release and I was super excited but well where do we start added a bunch of bullsh*t like the clothing and crap, the game is bugged to hell, first my racing wheel the Logitech G920 felt weird so I tried changing the settings tried others settings and it just felt wrong and fake, then after the updates 50% of the turning didn't even work it didn't turn until you got 50% of the way around and I thought it was the wheel so I went to Forza Horizon 3 and It worked like a dream, also the map is lame and the airport is terrible and to small, Its basically Forza Horizon 3 but a different map that sucks some more cars and a bunch of bugs and glitches that the developers are to lazy to fix, the Campaign is boring and stupid, the game entirety is boring, its the only Forza Horizon game that I got so bored of I stopped playing and regretted buying, so I recommend you get Forza Horizon 3 any day, Id rather Forza Horizon 2 even!"
3184,3,Just bought the game (physical copy) trying to play it on my xbox one x and it keeps kicking me out of the game once i try to get passed the initial setup. I have tried restarting the console uninstalling and reinstalling the game nothing seems to make a difference. Poor quality when a game is shipped broken. Other than this i love the forza franchise.
3185,3,"Single player is the only solid state of this game and even then that gets old quick.Online is totally broken and interface is very unintuitive. Forza Horizon 1 had a better interface than this. I just got done with an online game of Capture the Flag, by far the worse gaming experience I’ve had in a long time. The defending team can literally sit on where you have to pick up a flag to make it impossible to even grab a flag to play. How did the development team not realize that was a major oversight??Also the fact that Forza Horizon 1 had custom public lobbies and now FH4 does not is literally taking a step backwards. It makes no sense to get rid of a perfect function of the game. It’s frustrating if you want to only play a game of say infection you now have to sit in a typical server and rotate through 4 game modes to play the single game mode you want. I simply don’t understand the reason behind this... I intantly hopped back on RDR2 and shall remain on RDR2 for quite some time."
3186,1,This game sucks. Extremely hard even at rookie setting. I’m no hardcore gamer but this is ridiculous. Menus are confusing and too intricate. Hard to earn money to unlock the cars you want. It’s so hard to keep control of your car. It’s almost impossible to keep the tail end of your car from sliding out from under you and losing control.
3187,3,"I was very exited for this game but after 10 minuets I was already running into problems. The game will randomly crash or drop to one frame per second, and if you accidentally press the B button at the end of a horizon story challenge it will make you start the whole 15-20 min challenge over again and wont save. The game itself is good but all of the glitches and game-breaking bugs make it unplayable."
3188,1,"So.. when I bought the game.. the CD looked clean and no scratch at ALL. I was excited because I would be playing Mario kart! So when it came course I put the disc etc and it won’t read through my wii and it says error.. many people have gotten lucky but of course for me I didn’t get so lucky so I don’t know people if you guys want to purchase this game, that’s on you and your money but for me mines was a waste of my money."
3189,3,"Mario Kart is hands down the best Nintendo Wii game available! couldn't wait to play it, unfortunately the first day we used it, the game froze every 2 minutes. we tried taking it out and cleaning it a few times and it still did the same thing, very disappointed in the quality. we purchased new so we wouldn't have this issue and it backfired."
3190,3,"I purchased a used game, but when wanted to play it, it didn't work, I was able to play for 5min. the screen turn black and couldn't do much I eject the disc and the black screen still there so I turn the console off manually I play another disc and work find, just the Mario kart is not functioning even do I clean it, but t doesn't look bad, no scratches or dents."
3191,1,"The game disc is NOT new, it is very used and not in good condition. Case is very dirty and the CD has scratches all over it with one section the size of a dime scratched out. I am not even sure it will work in the Wii without skipping. I will be returning. Do NOT buy unless you are expecting a used game for new price."
3192,3,"I LOVE Mario Kart... I played it in single player and there was no issues. I go multiplayer and THE MOTION CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE! I'm driving and it turns me off a cliff. Maybe it turns me the wrong way, it lags so there's a delay. I was planning on playing this with my gf this weekend since she enjoys the game too. But no, now I have to explain that we can't because this game is God awful."
3193,1,"Luigi's Mansion was the first game I had on the Gamecube, and I loved it. When I heard they were making a new game starring Luigi, I decided to replay it. My memory didn't fail me, and the game was as great as I remembered. Dark Moon, however, doesn't hold up to it's predecessor.The game seemed very long and drawn out. One frustrating mechanic about it would be you would spend all this time searching for certain items, like a key to a door. You would find the key, then make it all the way back to the door, only to have a ghost steal it from you and run off, leaving you to go back and search for it again. Incidents like this would happen multiple times over the course of the game. It seemed like Nintendo rushed through this game with little creativity, making it very repetitive and monotonous. As much as I would love to recommend this game, I can't. If you want a great experience with Luigi, play the original."
3194,1,"The game starts off well, but you will quickly find that the save system stinks. You can go all the way to the end of a multiple section mission, die at the boss, and YOU HAVE TO START THE MISSION ALL THE WAY FROM THE BEGINNING.This could have been a great game, but it is so frustrating and such a waste of time to have to keep replaying missions if you die at the boss. Avoid this game, you will end up frustrated.It's beyond me why Nintendo doesn't offer a patch that saves the game after you complete each section of a mission. That's much fairer to the player and would remove the enormous frustration and waste of time spent redoing missions.I've stopped playing it and I'll be trading it in for an eshop credit at gamestop. I wish I had never bought it. Ugh."
3195,3,"I am so angry!! I ordered this for my son under the impression that it was the original game - not a Nintendo Selects version. If I wanted the Nintendo Selects version, I would have ordered the copy on Amazon that only costs $21 - I wouldn't have paid $36 for the same thing! This will likely be the last time I purchase a video game off of Amazon. I've gotten nothing but bootleg versions of games and when I purchase what appears to be an original game, I receive Nintendo Select versions."
3196,1,"I was at the big boss of the first mansion and lost my life. I literally started me from scratch at the beginning of the mansion away everything I had gotten on that mission. Gold, gems, dark light, etc. Now I have to go back, fight every ghosts, uncover every hidden item and get all the gold again just to get back to the boss fight (which I might lose and have to start all over AGAIN). F this."
3197,3,"Having loved the original Luigi's Mansion when it came out years ago, I was excited to play the sequel when I recently purchased a DS. Overall, it is a very fun game, however, it is very very redundant and does not do enough to differentiate itself from the original game. While I believe the original game was set in one mansion, this game takes you to a few different exterior/interior locations. The ghosts, I think, are also a little different. In my opinion, this is a good, not great game that is nearly as good as the original but is not different enough."
3198,3,"When we first purchased the game, my son was able to play online multiplayer for free. As some point, the game magically required $20 per year for online multiplayer. I guess that $20 allows online access for all of his Switch games, but this is obnoxious. Money for the console. Money for the games. Money for more controllers. Money for DLCs, amiibos. Money for online access. Gag."
3199,1,"This was a 5 start game when it first launched, however people figured out that they could hack it and that Nintendo’s fledgling online system has no was of automatically catching people. You will run into users who are using unreleased characters, guns, and know the location of all of your players at least every 1:3 ranked games, making it very hard to consistently raise you level. The single player version of this game is laughable and not every game mode is even available 24/7... I would not honestly buy this game at this point and wait for Nintendo to either release Splatoons 3 or overhaul there 1990’s online system. Search on google for the hacking issue, there are so many reports of this."
3200,3,"Somehow I read several reviews and didn't see that the multiplayer is online only. Only one person can play at a time on one Switch. Sure, this is my fault for not knowing this before I bought it. Also, my wife's, who also thought it was local multiplayer.On the other hand, I realized this instantly once I had the physical box, because there is a clear description on the back. I only saw the tiny little * on the Amazon product description page when I decided to return it unopened. Hence, 1 star for poor Amazon description."
3201,1,4 stars for the game - kids love it. 0 stars for retailer. They shipped us European version. While it works on the switch... now my kids can't buy any of the downloadable content for it because it is Incompatible and Nintendo does not refund on downloads. They are very disappointed. BUYER BEWARE: there is no indication on the listing that they will ship you the European version. The photos and description are the USA version.
3202,3,"Thanks to this seller, my son now has a game which is not correct for the U.S. region. Nowhere is this clearly stated, so beware! He can play the game, but he cannot add any expansions to the game. We discovered this only today when he purchased the expansion pack through the Nintendo online store which he cannot use and is non-refundable."
3203,3,"Complete drivel. Written from the perspective that glib generalities are a substitute for thought and substance. I actually felt my IQ lowering as I tried to force my way through the miasmic wanderings the author used to pad out the book between bits of content on the subject of the book. If those bits had been anything special, the wading might have been worth it, but they are only insipid reflections, not insights.Go enjoy any of his numerous interviews available elsewhere--skip this book."
3204,3,"Clearly written by a Muskateer. The entire book is so *hugely* slanted I wondered about incentive; a free Tesla, money, stock?It's unconscionable Musk isn't held accountable nor shows ANY remorse for being 'f-ing' verbally and psychologically abusive yet is lauded as though super human.Change the world, Musk? Really? Change yourself, stop perpetuating cruelty and abuse while posing as the helpless victim. Amazing and pathetic one man can cause so much suffering; employees are not captive prey!I am sorely disappointed as I LOVE biographies, but not this one. I bought the Audible version and will not make myself finish listening to it! I am grateful Amazon has returns/refunds on Audible!!!"
3205,3,"I did not finish this book. I believe that any account of a man of Musk's vision, passion and innovation should be provided with a level of respect and discretion that seems sadly lacking in our world today. While it is true that any complete work includes the good, the bad and the ugly - the small discourtesies included in this book were too frequent and off-putting."
3206,3,"""version of the truth"" about the times and events is warped too far from my personal experiences. As much I am interested in Musk's story, the reading is way too difficult. Perhaps I should wait for a better version."
3207,1,So Boring! The author just goes on and on about the most bland details on his start up companies etc. Musk sounds like a self centered egomaniac. If your looking for a page turner this is not that kind of book. if your a tech nerd and like boring facts about rockets and internet start up companies this book is perfect for you!
3208,1,"Bought this for my daughter as it was assigned as summer reading for a high school class. She suffered through it but her constant complaints about its too simple read, lack of new information, and condescending tone compelled me to skim parts of it. Simply put, this is a book for people who are clueless regarding literary analysis. If you understand symbolism and inference, you do NOT need to read this book. This book might be helpful for younger kids, such as 5th or 6th graders, who have had limited exposure to the language arts. However, since it also includes an entire chapter over sexual symbolism, perhaps not. I would not recommend it unless you need a truly remedial guide to understanding literary works."
3209,3,"The book i received was in decent condition, but it was the wrong edition! I should have received the revised edition, but I got the first edition instead. I'm sure they're not too different, but they're different enough that my professor specifically asked us to get the revised edition. I've attached a picture of the one I got in the mail (the wrong edition)."
3210,3,"This book starts with some specific facts & examples. After about 30 pages it descends into a PhD-in-literature's account of what books he has read & prefers and assumes the reader has read through every text in the Library of Congress, twice. It is a long, pedantic, impractical screed perhaps useful to literary PhD candidates for its references. The NY Times best seller list? Is it a required university textbook?"
3211,3,"Nothing against the book, but Amazon was selling copies with some generic professor's picture on the cover for 7.99. The ISBN is listed as 9781514202999. Apparently it's some type of self-published or bootleg edition of the book. The problem is that that version of the book has a tiny font and no page numbers, so for students needing citation information the book's pretty much useless. Amazon pulled the link to that edition, and won't let me return it, but I wanted to post a heads-up on this to save you the trouble of having to buy two copies of the same book!"
3212,3,"The 2015 edition is a version published through a self-publishing Amazon subsidiary called ""CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform"". It is missing several sections (example: Preface & Index). The formatting does not match earlier editions (example: statements in Bold and/or Italics that the author used to emphasize in earlier editions are in the same font as the rest of the text in the 2015 edition). We returned the book for a refund."
3213,3,"The Kindle edition claims to be updated on 2002, while it still has references to Soviet Union and USA as the only country where telecom companies are privately owned. This book was probably great around 1989 when it was published, but now it's useful only if you have completely no idea of effectiveness."
3214,3,"This ""book"" is about 2"" square, contains nothing but a little dribble of the original book and is useless. I thought I was getting a book that came highly recommended to me. Instead, I bought a mini thing that my daughters will end up using for their dolls.I NEVER write reviews but this has me steaming mad! Yes, the detailed description says ""miniature"" but in the title of the item it does not. If you already know about the product you are buying then there is no need to read the sales pitch. Thus, I had no idea I was about to be ripped off when I purchased this item.My husband and I are dedicated Amazoners- we spend more money on Amazon than just about anywhere else and we love the convenience but this sketchy sale has me questioning that loyalty."
3215,1,"Bought this book for my class, and it was painful to read. Reading the book is like reading Instagram inspirational posts. Don’t really have to use your brain when you read it because basically the author is just going circle and repeating himself while making up new words to make it seem fancy. His argument is very poorly supported. The 7 habits mentioned are what HE THINKS effective people have. He even used bible character to support his points of view, so....Good for people who are lost and need directions. But if you are intelligent, you probably already knew most of the things the author says."
3216,3,"I mistakenly bought this book. I selected the book so quickly I didn't read the fine print, ""miniature"". The amazon price $5.95. Normal retail is $4.95. It is a 2in x 2in size book with 95 pages averaging a little over one sentence per page. You do the math. Buy the real book not this miniature version. Any Covey book is worth the investment...er, uhh maybe just not this one."
3217,2,"Well yes when further investigated it mentions this is a small version of the book... This book is meant for a child and under no circumstances would I have purchased this book normally. When you click hardback and proceed to checkout it mentions nothing of this book being 1' x 2'. I needed this book to write a paper and am disappointed with this product. ESPECIALLY because it is sold at the same price, if not more than regular hardbacks for this book...never again."
3218,1,I gave this book to my husband in celebration of his 56th birthday. It really dampened the festivities and depressed him greatly. The content of this book is dark and lacked the author’s usual humor and had no positive message or ending. I felt like it is the worst possible gift to give anyone. Spare the feelings of the recipient and DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!
3219,3,"Frankly neither my wife nor I could believe this was a Dr. Seuss book. We loved ""oh the places you'll go"" and all the classics and expected something of that caliber but it was incredibly disappointing...nothing funny, insightful, or witty about it...quite a shock as those are classic traits of Dr. Seuss. We honestly feel this must have been a legacy book written by someone else who just didn't have the gift."
3220,2,"I ordered the book from this group because of their stellar rating and because the book was advertised ""like new"". When it arrived,the cover was so disgusting, I immediately threw it away. The book wasn't much better. This mismatch of what was advertised and what arrived has only happened once before in the many books I've ordered."
3221,2,"I ordered this book used in Good Condition as a gag gift for my fiance's 40th birthday. The description made it seem like a funny story poking fun at the aches and pains of growing older and the prospect of being sent off to a retirement home. When it arrived, I was immediately disappointed. I read through the book with my 12 year old before I intended to wrap it, but neither of us were laughing at the story. It basically follows the story of one man who goes to the doctor and keeps getting referred to different providers for different tests and being given various prescriptions for the multitude of ailments supposedly related to old age. These visits are interspersed with scenes of the man sitting in a waiting room talking to a fish in the office's fish tank. The cadence of text on each page does not always rhyme or feel like what you'd typically expect of a Seuss book, and the attempted humor often falls flat. I was also very disappointed with the condition of the book I received. The description listed the book as being in good condition with minor wear around pages and binding from previous readings, and as having the dust jacket intact. What I received was a dust jacket with a large, obvious sun-fade line across the top front cover from where it previously sat with some smaller object in front of it in direct sunlight for an extended period of time. This didn't concern me at first, as I may have removed the cover before gifting, but it had affected the front cover underneath as well. To make matters worse, the first page when the book was opened had a large hand-written inscription, in pen, from a previous gift-giver to a previous owner. I debated tearing the page out, but it would have ruined the title page that followed. I went back to check the description of my order to see if I had missed something, but nowhere did it state that even small markings, notes, or highlighted text would be present. A bit disgusted overall, I returned the book and decided against giving the gift at all."
3222,3,"I purchased this as a 60th Birthday gift and ended up returning it. I did not find it funny at all and most of the book did not even make sense to me. It followed an older gentleman going through a doctor's checkup/visit. However, none of the pages were funny in my opinion and not at all what I was looking for as a gag birthday gift. I was really hoping it would be a perfect gift based on all the good reviews but I personally did not find anything funny about it."
3223,3,"I initially thought that I would enjoy this book, but I really didn't. The narrator was quite good, but the story was about terrible people doing terrible things. It never ceases to amaze me what power-hungry people will do for money. I found that the longer I tried to listen to it the more I disliked it. I finally gave up and returned it to Audible for something a lot less soul draining."
3224,3,"This an account, and a good one, of the worst brat in literature. Never, in the years I have been reading books, have I come across a creature as horrific, ghastly, and simply appalling as Elizabeth Holmes. I am not a psychologist, and while it is possible this creature is within the realms of normal, I doubt this is the case. Surely she is one of the great liars of history, not to mention being offensive, controlling, judgmental, and generally someone to avoid. And, yes, the book is well done, but the subject is so ghastly as to make the book not worth the money.It is not sad so much as rock ribbed horrifying, since, of course, of all the deserving women who need attention in Silicon Valley, this vile excuse for a human being, because of her contacts and the like, gets attention that should go to others."
3225,3,"Anybody wonder how much money Carreyrou made conducting his sensationalized ""investigative reporting"" that delivered a one-sided, biased view of Holmes and Theranos? Millions! Think Carreyrou ever worked for a start-up? Invested in a start-up? For the record, the people who invested in Theranos can afford the write-off, though the company still is in business. And, the companies that will be disenfranchised if they don't develop new technology similar to what Theranos is developing go to bed each night thanking Carreyrou for giving them a few more years to survive."
3226,3,"This is a hatchet job kind of a book and while it has sold a lot of copies, this is really about the author's self-promotion. The lack of any serious evaluation of the science of testing blood insofar as it was attempted by this company makes this a waste of time. The psychological drivel that the author adds regarding the woman who started this company is vapid and overwritten."
3227,3,"I really wanted to like this book but it falls short. It’s about 3x longer than this story needs to be. Somehow, he manages to simultaneously get caught up in minutia that ultimately does not contribute to the plot while writing in a manner that feels rushed, and undeveloped. The writing is mediocre at best; the language relies heavily on cliché as if written for a freshman in college. The lack of style makes one think Carreyou’s aim was to appeal to the lowest common denominator. If not, he needs to fire his editor.Lastly I feel like the publication was a bit premature as this story is not quite over. I’m sure more will be revealed in the pending trials of Holmes and Balwani."
3228,1,"It's like every motivational and self help speaker you ever listened to got quoted (but not necessarily credited) here.And sadly, for a book published by a Christian publisher and authored by a professing believer, there is a noticeable lack of Biblical support, some profanity, and ideas that just aren't compatible with the Christian walk.I just can't recommend this to anyone."
3229,3,"I don't condone plagiarism. Therefore, I'll be returning this book. The author apologized that her team and writers didn't credit people. So who wrote the book? She admitted to this and it can be found online. A lot of Christian writers use ghost writers. That's fine. Did she and her publisher skip the taking of other writers words and claiming them as her idea as no one will notice? I'm very disappointed."
3230,3,"This is Rachel's second book and just like her first book it is being marketed to both a Christian and secular audience. But the contents give one cause for alarm as there are many anti-biblical principles and thought processes that raise some serious red flags. Just like her first book, she is putting herself and her life above all else and presenting this as the way to live even if you are a Christian.(which is secular humanism). If you read reviews on the Gospel Coalition and elsewhere they will confirm that the principles touted in this and her previous book are not Biblical. It's very sad to see people with a platform use it for personal glory and advancement and then claim to be a Christian. Once again, if this were being marketed to an exclusive secular audience then the views presented would be pretty typical. If you're a Christian however, you will find the contents to be contrary to the Bible."
3231,1,"I have never written a negative review for any purchase before, but, in this case, I feel like I’ve been had by a duplicate, haphazardly rewording of her last book. If you already read Girl, Wash Your Face, this book was a sad waste of money. It is almost like the same book, but thrown together haphazardly. [I listened to it on Audible; so, my review may not show as a verified purchase.] I actually loved Girl, Wash Your Face, but, I sadly feel that becoming a New York Time’s best selling writer has gone to Rachel’s head in a really bad way. She was sweet in Girl, Stop Apologizing, but now she comes off as horribly obnoxious. Even on her morning show, she is so rude and disrespectful toward her husband. I’d rather be poor and humble than rich and rude. This is a great example of how success isn’t everything, not if you lose all sense of dignity along the way, and to call her husband her “emotional support animal.” Oh my gosh. How horribly degrading.Rachel, you seriously need to take a super long break, and, yes, APOLOGIZE, first to your husband. He is amazing. You found a wonderful man who deserves much higher regard from you. Few men in this world support their wives to the extent that he has supported you. Second, apologize to your readers for spending their money on a book with virtually nothing new, even within the pages of this new book, you repeat things, perhaps to get your word count in that you so often speak of. It’s an insult to your followers. Third, you need to apologize to your poor parents, tearing them apart publicly the way you do. What happened to “Honor your mother and father?” Would you like your children to publicize your every flaw?This book made me so sad, sad to see so much self-indulgence above all else. No one matters, just me, me, me, me."
3232,1,"I purchased not one, but TWO of these, both of which were marked ""New"" and both of which did not come with a new code. Both books had the code already scratched off and used so purchasing the book with no code was useless. I ended up going to the Gallup StrengthsFinder website and purchased a code within 30 seconds. The book is also unnecessary--it's like 20 pages of talk about the research behind the book and the next 80 or so pages are just descriptions of the different strengths. Also the book is a mini book and is like 11 inches tall and 7 inches wide. In short: DON'T BUY from here, just go to the website for a guaranteed new code."
3233,3,"I think this book is a ploy just so you can spend more money. There is a code to obtain a LONG survey that asks you quite generic questions about how you handle yourself like ""Do you prefer to lead or to follow?, etc,"" which then spits out a 5 word summary of ""who you are"" as a person. The whole thing is crap to me, personally. If you purchase a used book, the code doesn't work and is quite costly. If you want, you can pay extra to redo the survey every year to see how you change. If you don't know yourself well at all as a person, maybe this book would help you, but it is so simple and generic and expensive that other personality tests online that are free would do a better job like the Meyers-Briggs Test, which has actually been scientifically proven over time."
3234,3,"I once took this quiz for free. It was fun. It provided a long list of my ""strengths,"" pretty much in the order I would've guessed. Because that was a long time ago--and because I thought I might get more out of the book, I purchased this 2.0 version. There are several places that mention the 34 ""talents"" or ""themes."" On one page, it's stated that I'll receive a ""top five theme report,"" but, on the next page, it states that I'll receive ""an overview of each of the 34 themes."" I thought that meant an overview, i.e. something brief, of MY remaining strengths. After taking the quiz this morning, I discovered that I would have to pay extra for the remaining 29. I believe the ""sale price"" was approximately $39. I reread the book's description on Amazon. It DOES mention ""a more customized version of your top five."" Maybe most people would understand that to mean *only* five. After previously taking the quiz for free and getting a more detailed report, I assumed the wrong thing.This was my first experience of getting partway through a book then needing to spend more money. It's like ""Offers In-App Purchases."" When I called the contact number, the representative told me I'm the first person to complain. Do I believe that? No."
3235,1,"Strength Finders 2.0 is a great tool to discover your strengths. WARNING: Do not buy the Audible version. The book is useless unless you take the online personality test. Amazon says when you buy the Audible version, you will receive an email with the code to take the online personality test. I bought the Audible version and never received the code. Customer service couldn't help. I eventually got a refund from Audible. Buy a hard copy of the book!"
3236,1,"Pretty unfortunate, considering that this was pretty much the only reason my professor required us to buy the book. If you're considering buying the kindle version, don't. It's been 48 hours and I still haven't received my access code, which was supposed to be sent within an hour of purchase."
3237,1,"I think this book is for some people. I bought a few of her books. And I gotta tell you, they all are basically exactly the same. Using the same experiences and the same stories but in different orders, she rehashes everything before. It'd be different if it were all meteoric. But everything is a bit mundane. I can read the same phenomenal book over and over again. And maybe a different book filled with the same stuff if it were, again, phenomenal, but this isn't so I quickly got tired of it. If you've read any other of her books, it's not worth it to get this one."
3238,3,"I truly expected and wanted to love this book because it came recommended by a mental health therapist who is a friend of mine. The more I read, the deeper the disappointment set in. If I eliminated all the pages the author spent establishing her authority and credentials, there would be nothing more than a pamphlet left. I kept reading and hung in there hoping to get to the spiritual meat of the book, which seemed to boil down most problems in life to shame and stepping up to the arena of life. Brene's examples of problems lacked depth and fell under the category of first world problems such as, her name wasn't placed on the top of the poster at a speaking engagement, her daughter didn't swim as fast as the others on the swim team, she responded to an angry e-mail with curse words instead of being the better person. The only knowledge I walked away with after reading Daring Greatly is that Brene Brown doesn't teach with the wisdom of an old soul."
3239,3,"Way too much author! It makes me wonder why someone that values vulnerability so much feels the need to pump herself up so much. She obviously doesn't have much confidence or inner contentment. If she did, she wouldn't feel the need to constantly tell us why she knows what she is talking about. Her whole approach seem counterintuitive. Maybe she should take her own a advice in her approach to writing. I'm sure she has some great things to say but it's too hard to wade through the clutter."
3240,3,"I’m sorry, but there was no content in this book. I kept turning the pages waiting for it to start and before I knew it the pages ran out. I’d expect a PhD researcher would have some empirical data to support the many comments that often started with “... and my research showed...” but rather the body of the book was not much more than repeating the same general idea over and over while telling nothing more than anecdotes."
3241,1,"Maybe it's because I had high expectations for this book, but I absolutely hated it. The author spends WAY too much time talking about herself without it emphasizing or contributing to her points. There was one point where she was telling a ""true story"" of how she apologized for being on the cell phone to a worker at the drive thru window, and the worker was so surprised and ""had huge tears in her eyes."" Really? We're supposed to believe that's a true story?In addition, for someone with a Ph.D., I expect footnotes, at minimum. There IS a list of ""notes/references"" at the back of the book, but I would have preferred a citation with each set of ""data"" and ""studies"" she continuously references, as you otherwise must match up the sources and sentences yourself. There is no mention of sample size, validity, or reliability. As a research assistant myself, I expected much, much more from the author.Conclusion: If you have zero interest in research or valid scientific ideas, give it a try. But if you expect something credible with sources and evidence, keep looking."
3242,2,"This book truly left me speechless!Astoundingly egotistical drivel that can be surmised in one sentence: achieving success requires incremental steps; keep moving forward, and start working hard today! Congratulations, you just saved $20 or however much I paid for the privilege of re-boxing and returning this useless waste of a tree.If this guy’s book was worth reading, he wouldn’t bore us all with his self-involved life story for the first chunk of the book; instead, I’d be interested in his life story of my own volition, and would seek out his interviews on YouTube and learn his story for myself. However, there are no such interviews, because his book is trash and he isn’t worth interviewing - thus, he must resort to marketing his own personality in the intro of a book all about himself; a book that never dives deeply into habit forming psychology, but instead belittles your intelligence with metaphors of ice cubes melting as the temperature increases (shocker) to outline how incremental habit changes work. Are you telling me that in order to make a change, I must start with the first small step in that process?This is the kind of book an Instagram model posts on her story to look intelligent and prove she’s not all looks. What a joke."
3243,3,I almost never am able to put down a book once I start it (<1% of books I've read) but I returned this one to Audible... Maybe the genre is one filled with egotistical blowhards but it is hard to listen to someone bang on about how great they are and harder to listen to an author that then writes about how successful he is... FOR WRITING THE BOOK... that I am currently reading... about his writing the book... which he brags about. Meta blowhard.
3244,3,"I have been receiving James Clear's newsletter for several months so when the book got out I ordered the kindle version immediately. But while the newsletter is occasionally interesting, the book is rather empty. There's nothing new, it's just a rehash of other books on the subject. There is no new perspective, no new insights. And there's nothing atomic about it. I am really disappointed, and I could not believe that the book became an instant best seller. If you have never read anything about habit forming, you will benefit from this book. But if you have, I don't see what you can get from Atomic Habits. I am also becoming tired of all the personal success stories from book authors because they can't be applied to the layman. I found there was nothing to learn from James' baseball days, as I never was an athlete and never excelled in sport. Feels like the average reader can't do this. I have bought the audible and Kindle version and will return one of them, keeping the other just to be fair to the author."
3245,1,"I was quite disappointed in this book given the reviews. It could be summed up in a couple of pages. There is no plan for making improvements in your life, just a few obvious observations about habits that are repeated over and over. Not worth the time or money."
3246,3,It’s the not the content of the book but the book itself..it was poorly put together including the book cover. I actually shut the book and haven’t picked back it up again for the misspelled word in the title..Attrective..really<U+0001F633>.
3247,1,If you were raised by wolves or have ZERO practical or financial knowledge you may be able to glean some information from this book. If you are a responsible adult you will find this to a a book to be an utter and complete waste of time! I am completely stunned and saddened grown adults find this useful. Can't recommend this book any less.
3248,1,"I was very excited to dive into this book since it came so highly recommended by folks, such as The Minimalists."" However, I could not be more disappointed. The first 1/3 of the book was a whole lot of statements, such as (and I'm paraphrasing here) ""My Total Money Makeover is proven to work"" or ""The only thing keeping you from being rich is a Total Money Makeover."" The entire book, in fact felt like one gigantic sales pitch for a branded package deal that Dave Ramsey sells via his numerous media outlets. The second 1/3 of the book is a whole lot of myths and truths, most of which are wrapped in lesson-learned stories from his listeners or readers. There are a few nuggets of practical advice in this section, but I can sum up his actual practical advice in one sentence for you here: ""Stay out of debt (never use credit cards), live frugally within your budget, and you too will be a millionaire."" There you go. I just saved you the cost of this useless book.The last 1/3 of the book is worksheet after worksheet to get you on a financial plan, with barely any context or advice on using these sheets, they seem to me to be filler for an otherwise poorly written book."
3249,3,"Okay, 99% of the time I read the book through swiping left. O c'mon, do really people get in such debts? I thought that all the not to do in the books are natural things for the humans. Thanks God I've been good with money since 5. One sentence - this book isn't for someone who knows how to manage her personal finances and has no debt."
3250,3,"If you take out the ""success stories"" of those who have followed ""The Total Money Makeover"", the book would be about 7 pages long. It is just all annoying ""success stories"" and not much useful content. I thought this was going to be a helpful book, but it is just a collection of stories of dumb people who bought huge houses and Dave himself who found a dumb friend who cosigned on his Jaguar...I paid over $16.00 for this book and have no problem paying $5.99 to return it. This book is stupid."
3251,1,"I'm sure the content of the disk is great, I love Dave Ramsey. But the disk did not work for me. Useless piece of plastic. Followed directions to download to Itunes on my computer then transfer to iphone. Over two hours of trying to get it to work and watching YouTube video and going to website for directions. No success. Why not just sell it as a download instead of this stupid disk? I coudn't even buy the audiobook had to sign up for free trial. I recommend getting in any other form than the MP3 disc."
3252,3,"So, I have been reading this book, then I find this as I turn the page. An entire page inked over. Not very happy with this. I've already began highlighting it because that's what I do, so I doubt I can exchange it.NOTE *** Page three of the main text had the same issue. My previous comment was in the preface. I flipped through the book and haven't found any more... but this is not good."
3253,3,"Loved the book, but the audio book stopped working halfway through of the reading of the book and neither Audible or Amazon was able to help to resolve the problem or give me a refund. The other audio book from this author worked perfectly through the entire book. I'm disappointed because I spent a lot of effort and time to try to get it resolved and felt like they didn't care. I feel bad about the low number because Jocko and Lief did a great job creating a useful leadership book."
3254,3,"Haven't had a chance to actually read the book yet, but so far I have found 2 pages that are missing the text completely. These are supposed to have actual words on them. There are other pages in the book like this, but it is a page break between chapters, but these are supposed to be real pages. Got the Audible version of this book as well and it filled in the blank pages but paid good money for this book and it is incomplete."
3255,3,"This is not a good leadership book. First and foremost, not all decisions deliver immediate consequences as is clearly stated in this book.A great leader has to learn how to work with all factions of people. We don't get a heavily vetted group of individuals to mold such as they do in the Seals.I read leadership books to better myself. This is a book of very interesting war stories and that really is it."
3256,3,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I had heard a lot about it and was looking forward to the read and the lessons. What I found was entertaining navy seal stories sprinkled with some very entry level ideas on being a more successful leader. If you had any sort of leadership or management training in your career, this book may seem a little basic to you. The authors make a fatal flaw assuming their Navy seal leadership tactics will work the same way with less disciplined civilian world employees. Some of the concepts do translate. Others not so much."
3257,2,"I owned this book in the past and wanted to reorder it to read it again. Instead of getting the book I expected, I received a tiny, hand sized book, with print that is too small and that is, frankly, hard to open all the way in order to read the words near the binder. So the book is utterly useless. With all the complaints about this tiny book, I'm not sure why that is the book that automatically comes up when you search for the book. Instead, the normal sized book should be the default, and then people can select the pocket sized book if they want. So I would say that the content of the book is excellent. DO purchase the book; however, BE SURE TO SELECT THE LARGER, PAPERBACK VERSION if that's what you want (sorry for the all caps, just want to make sure people see that part)."
3258,1,"Here's the thing. You may learn something from this book if you have never spent much time learning about personal finance and investments. There's no problem with that but the reality is, is that this book and all the follow-on books are on some levels are just generic advice. So far as anyone can tell, he made his money from these books and the subsequent Cashflow Technologies Scam Company. I actually just returned from a meeting with a nice couple who were trying to ""bring me into this circle"" and as soon as they mentioned Robert Kiyosaki I knew exactly which scam this was. It was only because of this meeting I felt so inspired to come here and write this review after reading the book a few years ago. I felt it to be my responsibility to help lower the review on this book so maybe less people would fall into this trap in the future. If you really want to learn there is a great myriad of resources online that are both more accurate, more definite, and better qualified to give financial advice than this book."
3259,1,"Kiyosaki highlights important principles for wealth creation and entrepreneurship but this is simply a marketing hook for the highly questionable training Rich Dad Education business. Ultimately it is a mash of vague generalizations and unsubstantiated and conflicting claims about macro economic principles. Readers will find a themselves asking more questions than are answered. I don't have a problem with provoking thought, but after more investigation, and personal attendance of a seminar sponsored by his organization, it is clear this a marketing piece to lure people into increasingly expensive, and presumably vapid training programs to get 'rich' through real estate and options trading practices. To my knowledge, and after some research, there is no demonstration of any case examples of anyone who has been successful apply any of the concepts to their benefit. Readers beware: if you follow the path started in this book, you will ultimately face a decision to pay a minimum of $10,000 to $45,000 for 'elite' training. Kiyosaki is a practitioner of ""Network Marketing"", or pyramid marketing schemes. If you want to learn actionable strategies for creating a wholesale real estate business, let alone options trading or any other area of wealth creation, my advice is to identify those areas and seek specific guidance from other demonstrated leaders in those fields."
3260,3,"The book is really easy to understand and to read, the message Robert gives is good and can help you change your mindset to be more financially independent but please beware of richdad education. After purchasing this book I immediately received ads all over social Media Facebook and instagram about Rich dad education seminars. I sign up for and went to one of their “free” seminars just to find a random guy talking about how rich and and wealthy he become after rich dad education and how now he is giving back to the community teaching them how they can become wealthy by doing all the real estate strategies promising that they will teach all this great strategies if you purchase a 3 day seminar for $700.00 ... and so I did purchase the 3 day seminar excited to find out what I was promised “real estate strategies” unfortunately after a few hours of being in the seminar I realized that all they were doing is talking about how you need and must invest on a 50k package plan. So you can have access to a mentor. 3 whole days just listening to an old lady talking about her life and how rich and wealthy she is, brainwashing you to invest in their plans to the point of asking for extreme personal financial information. wasted 3 days of my life and $700.00 just to give them the opportunity to talk about how I need to purchase their $50,000 legacy plan. They never talk about what I was promised at first on any real estate strategy. Please beware of this scam. I posted the packages they almost force to purchase and the questionnaire are you need to submit so they know how much money you have and or how you can get a loan to purchase their package."
3261,3,"This is my first Book review on Amazon or ever, so I'll try to keep short and to the point.When I first found and bought this book, I thought it was, as the name states, a guide to investing. To my surprise, I found it anything but that.He speaks as he always does on the mindset and how to approach the world of investing, the different types of investors and so on..I found it very irritating that he kept referring to his Rich Dad in every bit of advice he gives, a sort of scapegoat to me. Especially, since Rich Dad is not a real person according to many interview done with him.The silver lining is that there are some solid key points here and there, but what I have to say is that: *it does not take +400 pages to say what he has to say* he is literally rehashing old stories from the first two books and retelling them times and times again.In all honesty, I started this review with a 4-stars review and dropped it to 3-stars in the middle of this review and now at the end of it I'm not even sure if those 3-stars are a correct assessment of the merit of his book.In his defense, he did say he is a Best-SELLER not a best-writer."
3262,1,"This low rating is a combination of two things. First, I was never sent a test code via email by amazon as the order details stated would happen. However, on having time to contemplate the idea of an ""emotional intelligence test"", I would imagine gaming the ""correct"" answers for a the highest scores would be incredibly easy. If someone else was required to answer the questions on your behalf based on their understanding of your personality, that may actually yield some decent self-reflective content. Second, this book is shockingly light on content. Travis spends the majority of his time filling pages hyping up his system, rather than actually providing informative and helpful content. The only person who is seeing financial and professional success from this book is the author.I would recommend Emotional Intelligence: A Practical Guide by Dr. David Walton, over this book any day."
3263,2,The lackluster writing with bold encased double text was unbearable to read. Very basic information and if you already have a good sense of who you are and where you want to go then this book is utterly useless.The self test was a complete joke. Do you think a dozen questions will determine who you are and how to change what needs to improved? Check out the DISC test which is 100x more in depth. I'm done buying books and sticking to the ones have real credibility.
3264,1,I hear the content of this book is wonderful. Unfortunately as part of the Amazon Kindle purchase you are also supposed to receive a code via email so that you can take an online appraisal to help learn the content. But the code was never sent and Amazon customer service was not equipped to resolve the issue. They referred me to the publisher so I returning the book. I would suggest you not purchase the Kindle version of the book unless you are sure to receive the associated appraisal code.
3265,3,This book was VERY disappointing! It’s basically an internet listicle of really shallow tips. Like “listen” and “write down how you’re feeling”. I would hardly call this a self help book - it’s not any better than a free online article. Books like difficult conversations or even the oldie learned optimism are much better.
3266,1,"Downloaded this book on the advice of a classmate who said it was great. After reading the introductory section I was hoping to get to some good content, but it never came. I was really hoping to learn some interesting stuff on the latest emotional intelligence research, but honestly I felt like the whole book could have been boiled down into a 20 slide PowerPoint. I learned basically nothing from this book. For example, one of the sections said to go people watching at a coffee shop and watch how people interact. Another section advised me to listen to what others say before I start to speak...... no duh. I can only imagine that this book would be helpful to some sort of high-functioning self-aware robot that is trying to blend in better with society. Because “don’t ask for a raise when the company is doing poorly” is not news to me or most of the people I know. Save your money. Unless you are SERIOUSLY socially inept, this book isn’t going to do you any good."
3267,3,"The 48 Laws of Power is the opposite of the Golden Rule. It recommends taking advantage of others in any way you can, and tells you how. It's rationale is that everyone is selfish so why not be intelligently selfish. If all the world acted according to the 48 Laws of Power the accumulated animosity would shatter nations. It is only because many people follow the law to treat others as you want them to treat you that selfish people do not destroy more than they do. As an antidote I would suggest the book ""Give and Take, A Revolutionary Approach to Success."" It is based on scientific studies that show that good guys do indeed win, and they do it by helping others succeed, networking, being honest, and other ways. I'm glad I bought the 48 Laws Of Power -- so I can spot selfish, greedy people more easily and steer clear of them."
3268,1,AWFUL ! My boyfriend reads a the time and he wanted to add to his collection and he asked for this book I read the back cover when I got it and it’s awful some of the things they say in here it’s basically telling you how to play people against each other and hurt people to get what you want ! Disappointed to only tht author but my boyfriend for wanting to read this crap.
3269,1,This is a book about how to be a terrible person in order to get ahead in life. If thats the kind of person you want to be then read it. But it I could not even get half way through the book before throwing it in revulsion at what it suggests you do to get ahead in life. Basically lie cheat do whatever you have to do in order to get what you want no matter who you hurt.
3270,3,"WOW! I was asked to purchase this book for a client. Which I did. I wanted to see what my client was reading, so I ordered the for myself. I read the back cover....I was scared for humanity. Basically it is a ""how to"" manipulate and not take any responsibility for your own actions. ""Don't outshine the master."" WHO is the master? Talks about victims....so that make YOU reading the book, the tormentor?""Pose as a friend, work as a spy."" I get that we should take control and not let people take advantage of us. But this books looks more like a ""how to"" for wanna be Sociopaths....They should sell this book with ""How to spot a sociopath!"""
3271,3,"48 laws of power are 48 ways to manipulate people to your will by any and all means necessary. ""Create a cult like following"" give your disciples rituals to perform and ask them to make sacrifices in your behalf"".""When asking for help, appeal to peoples self interest, never their mercy or gratitude"".Strike the Shepard and the sheep will scatter. Play dumb, lure people in with kindness and use it against then later.This book will not inspire anything good.The author gives thanks to others for help in the writing, however this is nothing more than a true representation of Law 3Conceal your intentions, use people.
5 people found this helpful."
3272,3,"This was a painful read. The bulk of the book is a highly fictionalized and poorly written story of a manager and her team. It's meant to illustrate main concepts, but was so artificial and uninteresting that you'll probably come to the end of the book with less negative bias if you just skip to the end and read the few pages that summarize the author's theories about the five dysfunctions and how to address them. Better yet: skip the book entirely and look for a summary of those concepts anywhere on the internet. Then take them with a large grain of salt. There's no evidence presented that indicates that the perspectives/solutions presented by the author are valid.This is a shiny motivational sales pitch from beginning to end."
3273,3,"Guess what? A theoretical model for maximizing team performance, works perfectly when applied ‘experimentally’ on a cast of characters whose actions, thoughts and behaviors are under the complete and total control of author. Also, found the blatant ageism egregious. ‘Only an old school (Gen X/Boomer) ops manager with her proven production experience and grit can turn a bunch of whiny, undisciplined, me-first millennials into a functioning team.’ Please."
3274,2,"The concept is fine - the five dysfunctions are listed as absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results. You can get an understanding of this by reading a free, 2-page summary at tablegroup.com. Spend the $14 on this book if you want to see the concept illustrated in a cheesy, fictional story in which a company is saved by the arrival of a perfectly balanced, omniscient, superhero CEO (who just so happens to be a former All-American college volleyball player, too). I felt like I was reading a Brady Bunch script.For a better use of time, go to schwarzassociates.com and download (for free) Roger Schwarz's 12-page article, ""Eight Behaviors for Smarter Teams"". I also highly recommend the book ""Authentic Conversations"" by Showkeir and Showkeir, for insight into both communications and accountability.My work team periodically holds book discussion groups. This book will NOT be on our reading list."
3275,1,"After receiving this book and it getting accidentally wet, I realized that there was a round section covered with permanent black marker on the cover. A smaller black marker circle with a sticker over it was on the back. Underneath the black marker on the front it states “Illegal for Sale in USA.” The circle on the back states, “Illegal for Sale outside INDIAN Subcontinent.” I am horribly disturbed and mortified that someone is selling a cheap (content modified to suit Indian context) and less expensive version from India (sold for the same price as the US version but costs much less for the seller)!! How do you get away with this?!!!!!"
3276,3,I am sure that this is a high quality book when read in its hardcopy published form but the text is almost unreadable on my Kindle Fire tablet. I tried using it on my Kindle app on my Windows PC and blowing it up as large as possible and it is better but still a chore to read. I regret having purchased the Kindle version. I have a hardcopy of the original non-illustrated version of this classic book (which I use with teams at work to make them more effective). Thus the content of the book is worth 5 stars but the execution of this illustrated version on the Kindle must be rated at one star. I am sure it is better in hardcopy but this review is for the Kindle version.
3277,1,"I have been listening to the audiobook version of this; was thinking that this would be in the same vein as Danny Kahnemann's magnificent opus or the book by Richard Thaler. Far, far from it. It didn't help that the narrator seems to be channeling the pomposity of the author, amplifying it. The biggest takeaway from this book is that the general populace is much stupider than I have been suspecting, leading ""unexamined lives"". The Hannibal Lecter's quote kept coming to my mind: ""You think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?"" If this ""negotiation by the numbers"" really works, then - again, people are quite dumb. To that end, the examples of author's brilliance (which, as some have pointed out, may be his overcompensating for perceived inferiority when lecturing Georgetown MBAs) seem completely bogus. The primary emotion from listening to 1/2 of this is annoyance. Hence - 1 star. Now, try to negotiate me away from this review. It is fair. That's right, it is fair.EDIT: Am almost done with this treatise. Still just as annoying - doing it as a penance, I guess. One thing that occurred to me is that in all his examples these 'techniques' either work brilliantly, or fail because somebody didn't do it ""correctly"". This is the very epitome of baloney; his anecdote of buying the 'truck of his dreams' is particularly egregious. Arghh."
3278,1,"Book has duplicated pages and tons of missing pages. Text on pages are skewed and font sizes randomly change within each page. Impossible to read and amazon won’t allow return. The book was good up until page 38, where it then skipped to page 55 and had pages 55-70 twice. Poor quality control during printing makes this book too much of a risk to buy and not be able to return even if it’s defective."
3279,1,"The book opens with the author being role-played by two of the best negotiators in the world, allegedly. They tell him they want a million dollars of they'll kill his son, right? So, he asks them an open question (gasp!) in return. This apparently throws off the guy sitting opposite him and he ends up acknowledging that the author ""can teach us something"".So, we're supposed to believe that this author slam-dunks the head of Harvard's negotiation school and a veteran negotiator with the Israeli Defence Force, with one open question?Fiction, in my opinion. The book has no credibility after that."
3280,3,"This book started off as a great, helpful read. Unfortunately, as I started to get deeper in the book, the printing began to cut off major pieces of pages, causing important details to be missing. I am enjoying the book and want to finish reading it, but I don’t want to continue to miss items on pages. I tried to exchange the book for a new one, but Amazon’s return policy will not allow me to do so. It seems unfair that the only way to read the whole book is to purchase another copy."
3281,1,"This is by far the most disappointing book I have read in a while. While I was expecting an introduction to proven negotiation tactics, filled with practical examples and tips, what I got was a populist, pseudo-intellectual book filled with half-truths that can only be convincing if you are a below-average sales man that likes to trick old ladies into buying life insurances. If you have only the slightest bit of intelligence, this book will disappoint you. I’m sorry I can’t give a more sophisticated review, but I also feel like this book does not deserve one. And I am not even mentioning the bad writing style and old-fashioned, patriarchal texts. Skip this book - that is my sincere recommendation."
3282,1,"I had to take this course through my work - using up 2 FULL days of work...and I have to say, it was a complete waste of time! I don't know who is giving this book 4 or 5 stars...the only people this information will assist is the Brady Bunch! The information is completely unrealistic. The scenarios provided in the videos are not one-size-fits-all. Speaking of the videos, they are kind of offensive...the people are over-acting and the information spewing out of their mouths are not like ANY conversations I have had in my 53 years with anyone that I know or work with! The authors are full of themselves as there are several videos of themselves spewing the phony propaganda they are trying to sell in this ridiculous book. There is way too many acronyms that we are supposed to remember when having a ""crucial conversation"" like AAMP, STATE, CPR...I can't even tell you what each of these means because it is too ridiculous. Are people REALLY going to remember an acronym before having an important conversation with someone??!!!! Probably not. I can recall the S in STATE and that is Story - so in essence, they are telling me that the important things that happen to me in my life is not my life, but a ""story""...this is absolute malarkey! I found it to be insulting, insensitive and totally unrealistic! If you want a helpful book, stick with your hero's autobiography...you will benefit more from learning from your hero than from this book!"
3283,3,"There is zero scientific research and this is written by those trying to make a dollar. While the pop psychology is okay it ignores that humans are involved and translating these observations is even possible. The writing doesn't even follow their own observations. These authors have little qualification to speak on this subject as experts. The book format is haphazardly structured which does not lend itself to a useable flow, which the authors tried to fix at the end. If observation was science then saliva is lethal since everyone that has died on this plant has swallowed it their entire life."
3284,3,"This review isnt about the content of the book its about how i received the book and its condition. When it says “buy used-good” i expect good. I dont expect brand new but i expect good. What i got was horrifying. Im not sure if someone was ripping their hair out reading this book and coming to some realizations and then stuffing their hair in the book so it shows what page they were the most frustrated, but this book had enough hair in it to make a wig. Apart from the mass hair clumps, there were sticky black substances on multiple pages. Some with hair attached for more pleasure. And then the best part is half of the book is water damaged. I had the book in my bed when i started to read and i am mortified. Someones bed of hair was with me in bed as i began to read."
3285,3,"I read this book as part of my local pmp chapter. I found the examples take too long to build up and have weak punchlines and also that there is little basis to make claims. For example, the authors offer little scientific research to explain the fight or flight scenarios we find ourselves in often. The afterward was ridiculous; one of the authors gave an example where he did not want to pay $3 to park his car. Come on now, this book is good my to help me? Idiotic..."
3286,1,"Crucial conversations is an unnecessarily lengthy self-help book that professes to help you achieve better personal and business relationships through the power of dialogue.The book, however, is operating under a false premise.The book repeatedly gives examples of dialogue that are clear fiction. Not only do the imaginary characters not speak as a person would in their situation, but their reactions are boiled down to key phrases and input-output style dialogue that is used to attempt to prove the book's point. Over 60% of the words in the book are tied up in these fictional examples, making the only truly useful information the few sentences at the end of each chapter in the ""summary.""The unrealistic scenarios provided only underscore a bigger problem with the book, which is that in no chapter does it attempt to advise for situations involving a negative discrepancy in power and authority.Every example involving a ""manager"" and ""employee"" is from the point of view of the ""manager."" There are no examples that show how to gain ground with managers who either disregard your attempts at dialogue, or who do not see your opinion as valid or necessary. In almost every relationship (especially business ones, where a clear hierarchical system is in place) one party has greater power than the other. If you find yourself on the high-power end of this arrangement the tools in Crucial Conversations may be helpful, but in situations where you are on the lower-power end, the premises provided in this book are either irrelevant or useless.If you think this book will help you with a bad boss, it will not. Do not buy this book.If you think this book will help you with an authority figure, it will not. Do not buy this book.If you think this book will help you with a micro-manager, or a person who is not giving you respect, it will not. Do not buy this book."
3287,2,"If this the criteria to be a NYT bestseller then I should make bank! I'm am engineer and found this book to be useless. I mean, seriously? Throw out everything that doesn't bring me joy? That's the answer? Well, no joke. We all know that we have too much stuff and should part with it all. I thought that if I had to read one more time how the author was positively an organizational genius at age 15, I would throw that book...which didn't bring me joy...into the trash. As for making my socks and purse happy, my socks are all cozily snugged up together by color...I am an engineer, after all...and my purse feels it is its honored duty to protect its precious traveling companions...the wallet, the inhalor, etc... 24/7.I, unfortunately, learned some great lessons about parting with too much stuff 8 months ago when my hoarder mother passed away. I bought 120 large trash bags and with a determined ruthlessness, I tossed out 3 tons of trash. Boxed up new stuff for donation. Held estate sales for things of value...which Ms. Kondo does not seem to address very well. I thought that I would gain some insight from this book about purging my own messy house. I don't want to do to my kids what mother did to me. However, this book was no help. As someone else suggested, don't waste your time reading the entire book. Just read the sentences in boldface print. Honestly, that's all that should have been printed but there wouldn't be much money in selling a brochure."
3288,2,"This book is crap. The author feels the need to keep bringing up the fact that she is, apparently, the perfect organizer. She talks about herself entirely too much, and once I got the part about getting rid of all of my books I was like, ""NOPE!"" I understand her concept that you should throw away anything that doesn't make you feel happy when you touch it, but some of her ideas are ridiculous. Get rid of most of your seasonal clothes and only keep things that can be worn year-round? I live in Maine. It gets cold in the winter and hot in the summer, so explain to me what I'm supposed to wear. I had heard some pretty good things about the Kondo Method of cleaning and I just wanted to declutter my house a bit so I bought this book, but I feel ripped off. This was not the one for me."
3289,2,"I truly hate everything about this silly book, and yet I gave the author the courtesy of actually reading the whole thing, well beyond the point where she finally totally lost me. She lost me at books, and the idea that books are merely paper and printed words. NO! Books reflect an owner's lifetime of aspiration and curiosity and study and knowledge. They reflect how we see ourselves. The ones read before are cherished as part of one's history, the date(s) when read perhaps noted on the front page. They hold vivid memories of who we were when we first read or acquired them. The last ones I'd ever discard are the ones I've already read, unless of course I found them as inane as Ms. Kondo's book. I get the idea of ""sparking joy,"" and I understand that there are people so overwhelmed by junk that they can't figure out where to begin, but for others of us, happiness and memories are embedded in our possessions, and would be lost in the absence of them. Some of us are collectors. Some have saved for a lifetime as the historians of our lives. The goal of such lives is to surround ourselves with cherished possessions and enjoy them, not to sip herbal tea of an afternoon with nothing to look at but a bouquet of flowers -- the ideal state of being Ms. Kondo holds out. Ms. Kondo says she wants to enable readers to decide what to keep, but in fact her method of piling every book or stitch of clothing in one place is designed to shame people into discarding, and she really doesn't care where it goes. Mountains of waste for landfills are just fine as long as they leave the house. At least to this reader, advocating turning possessions into waste withing making a serious effort to sell or donate the best of them is irresponsible. We all should be free from guilt packing things away so that they may ""spark joy"" another day, or simply find new utility when our lifestyles change again. I refuse to engage in a war on possessions as though happiness can come only in the absence of them. I can't wait for this fad to pass."
3290,1,"Here's what the book says: touch every item in your home and if you ""love it"" then keep it. If you don't get that warm and fuzzy feeling of love, throw it away. There. Now you don't have to read it. Seriously, de-cluttering and organizing can have a huge positive impact on life. But the way this book approaches the topic is so silly and juvenile that I don't understand why it's a best seller. People: use your common sense and toss the things you don't use that are cluttering up your life. Ok?"
3291,1,"I may hold an unpopular opinion here, but I think she’s way too extreme.Let me clarify, I’m all for a clean and uncluttered home, that’s what attracted me to buy this book in first place. I’m sorry to say I disagree with her on many points.The main principal is hold everything in your hand for a few seconds and if that something doesn’t spare joy, get rid of it. Get rid of anything you don’t need nor use, even if it has sentimental value.Well, here are the many problems: My work clothes and coffee don’t spark joy for me, because they remind me I have to wake up at alarm and go to work. Can I get rid of my work clothes? Obviously not, a responsible adult should get to work and pay bills.My tennis shoes don’t spark joy for me at all. Why do I have to workout? I’m keeping it so I’ll go run because it’s good for health.She stated get rid of books, basically all books if you’d. For example the reference books from the seminar, because those materials had served their purpose (for the duration of the seminar)... guess what, I’m getting old and I WILL need to go back and look.She criticized people that stockpile stuffs at their home (someone with 36 toothbrushes, or 20,000 cotton balls, or too much toilet paper). I agree that most people shouldn’t turn their house into a supermarket warehouse. However you can bet when $10 Charmin goes on sale for $5, I’ll buy 10 packs and have them on my shelf for the next 6 months, because I like to save $50 and supermarket shelf is not different from my shelf. I have joy for saving, take that Marie!!She said, treat your socks and purse well. Don’t roll your socks, don’t turn it into a ball, because they need to rest so they can better server you. Also don’t forget to thank your purse. Say what???She stated, don’t feel bad to get rid of gifts that your friends and family gave you. Whether to keep the gifts is up to my preference, you can be sure that I’ll at least feel bad to get rid of them, because I won’t treat my family and friends effort and thoughts less than a pair of socks. (Eyes rolling)This getting rid of everything really doesn’t work for everyone. If anyone has aging parents or any older relatives would know. Majority of them are very attached to their things. These things remind them of their lives, their experiences, and make them happy. She recommends getting rid of even items from your children or parents. She started getting rid of stuffs at a young age, no wonder her eyes look empty, she’s throwing her own history. Thank goodness she’s not advising the museums, or all human history would be gone.It’s no doubt that we live under extreme materialism and we have too much stuffs. However no one can be 24/7 joyful from the moment they are born and to the moment they stop breathing, and certainly no one needs to thank their own socks. This whole surround yourself with only joyful things is utter nonsense.My advice: clean up your home, keep functional items, and keep a few meaningful items. Look at that childhood jersey once in a while and remember the happy times you had with your Dad. Touch that dress that Mom made for you from grandma’s sewing machine. Keep a few of your children’s toys and clothes to cherish the happy childhood you provided for them. Keep little toys from the fur babies that went to puppy heaven and remember how much they loved you and followed you around. Keep your high school yearbook so you can laugh with your friends many years from now. Some of these things are part of you! It’s not a crime to have some stuffs. As long as you don’t live in a mess, as long as you’re not a hoarder and have a clean and functional home, don’t bother with this book and be happy!!"
3292,3,"Not only was the book especially tedious to read (even for someone like myself, who works in the field), it illustrated a massive difference between an older generation of psychologists and a newer generation... emphasis on neurological processes rather than contrived ""systems"". System 1 and system 2 were often described as completely separate entities that were competing. If the ""renowned"" psychologist (erhm, economist?) had mentioned, at least once, the feedback loops and neural circuitry involved in processesing information deliberately or automatically, I could have continued reading. As it is, a false dichotomy (systems 1 and 2) are proposed, which were already outdated by the time the book was published. From a neurological perspective, these systems aren't two, but one highly specialized process. Why not have a discussion on why it makes sense, from an evolutionary perspective, to make snap judgments or why it's better for the social human brain to be associative than statistical? The book only felt long because of how terribly narrow its contents."
3293,3,"This book just never grabbed me. Reading the first few chapters it felt like I was still reading the introduction and it didn't get better thereafter. The book needs an editor as the story is told without much style and feels like words just thrown on a page, making it very laborious to read. So many of the experiments and anecdotes seemed trivial and were just uninteresting. Beyond the obvious point that our intuition is complicated and sometimes erroneous, I didnt have any other meaningful takeaways. I just read ""Superforecasting"" and ""Blackbox Thinking"" both of which I really enjoyed (BBT doesn't get enough attention in my opinion and I highly recommended it) and Taleb's Swan and Fooled are classics. These books were both interesting and inspirational, F&S was neither."
3294,3,"...why are all these pop-science/psychology/economics books written by out-of-touch coastal academics like Kahneman, who never worked a day in his life as he flitted from one academic ivory tower think tank to the next...bragging about ""working hard"" while enjoying a highly-paid sinecure at a think tank in Oregon just shows how far removed from the average American this egghead is......this book (read: money grab) is a collection of brain teasers and illusions used to show how much smarter and more insightful than the working man this effete academic is - truth is, he wouldn't last 2 weeks in the private sector - in the immortal words of professor-cum-""Ghostbuster"" Dr. Ray Stantz:“…Personally, I liked the university. They gave us money and facilities, we didn't have to produce anything! You've never been out of college! You don't know what it's like out there! I've *worked* in the private sector. They expect *results*…”."
3295,3,"I found the introduction and very beginning interesting, but then this book quickly becomes outdated, poorly argued and insulting.This author seems to asses the worth of a person based on how well they can solve little brain teasers like the classic baseball problem: “A bat and ball cost $1.10. The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?” Tells you to solve it intuitively, then spends the rest of the chapter bashing anyone who got it wrong. He calls them lazy, associates them with lower IQ scores and says they’re less likely to engage in delayed gratification. (The ball is 5 cents by the way, something I had to work very hard to understand over several exposures to this problem because some of us are really bad with numbers.)It gets worse during the question, “How many muders occur in the state of Michigan in one year?” If you didn’t factor in Detroit and guess highly, you’re basically a dummy, according to this guy. Can’t possibly have anything to do with that fact that I avoid crime reports to keep my anxiety under control.Next I’m treated to an entire chapter on how we’re all slaves to environmental priming/linguistic association, whether we know it or not. And there’s nothing we can do about it!At one point the guy references David Hume’s principles of association from 1748(!), calling them outdated, but still a good starting point for what he wants to talk about. If you use outdated information as a starting point, your entire argument is invalid.So in the last roughly 60 pages, I’ve been called lazy and told I have no control over my own mind. And I’ve been instructed to think about my mind in terms of an artificial dichotomy rather than an integrated, holistic whole, which flies in the face of both 12 years of meditation and modern day neuroscience.What is this book even trying to do? I’m sick of trying to read “highly rated” non-fiction, and then finding the dumbest arguments imaginable. Are we culturally really this stupid?"
3296,1,"The book is good but the ebook is not great. I can't find the footnotes - they're replaced by asterisks that can't be usefully tapped on or anything. There's no indication anywhere of where the footnotes went. Some captions are missing. Examples are misaligned so badly, where alignment matters, that they lose their meaning altogether.I wish I had just bought the hardbound or paperback edition. Don't bother with the Kindle edition."
3297,3,"Cons1) Very outdated. Some of the companies that are praised in this book are already bankrupt or just around the corner from bankruptcy/ government bailout . This book was published in 2001, no word of Apple,Google,Amazon,Facebook etc. so take it for what it’s worth.2) Main problem of this book, its going backwards from results to reasons. It’s take a “successful” company and try to explain its success came from some master plan that was well crafted. Nonsense, other companies did the exact same to a different amount of business success.3) Nothing in this book relates to the global economy, millennial generation and the mobile retail revolution. This book was published in 2001, this is also its relevance expiration date.Pros1) I liked the chapter about level 5 management, nothing new here but refreshing ideas about humility and open minded leaders.2) I liked the hedgehog chapter about focusing your business on what you love and what you good at to maximize profits.3) Positive lessons about running a healthy company that work as a team.Bottom lineFun read, but nothing new here. You can’t apply any lessons from this book to today economics. If you have a few hours to kill, go for it."
3298,3,"Many things have been said on the lack of rigor and statistically valid inferences in this book. But it is not the unique problem of this manuscript. Self-helping and cheerleading literature, in general, favors positive examples to ""explain"" the successes of the past. Hindsight is always 20/20 and everyone knows it.What really signs death sentence to Collins work is the fact that he chose to study companies and companies that lived long enough to put shame on people who think they can predict the future with a pencil and a secretary. It's now 2013 and Good to Great was first published in 2001. It's been only 12 years since the publication and yet the list of hand-picked ""companies of greatness"" was blown by the wind of change. We all know what happened to Fannie Mae. Circuit City filed bankruptcy. The rest of the list underperformed compared to S&P 500.In other words, Collins is not just ""wrong"" according to his own criteria. He is, in fact, completely random. He could as well throw a dart into a newspaper and come with similar results.So is ""Good to Great"" completely without merit?I don't think so. First, it pays to pick it up used for $0.99 and see how one of the most successful business series books are done. That is, sell pseudo-certainty to gullible people. Second, it teaches a student a whole lot about processes with infinite variance like stock performance. Third, Collins praises companies (like Fannie Mae) for exact same things (clever borrowing against future risks) that ultimately killed those companies.Bottom line? Collins is a charlatan, but there are many lessons to be learned from his failures. It makes it worth one dollar."
3299,3,"Should be titled: Good to Great, How to Overuse Analogies. The use of analogies to help someone understand something they can not relate to is one thing, but the use of analogies over and over again is the sign of a weak mind; I stopped reading when he started using analogies to explain analogies. The data and topic were not very deep, probably grade school level, pretty easy read if you can handle the analogies."
3300,1,"It's hard to know what to say about this book. People love it, and love what it says, but several of the companies profiled turned out to be cooking their books, cheating customers, etc... Wells Fargo, Sallie Mae, GE... So I'm left wondering, were these companies extraordinarily successful because of the processes and ideas presented in the book, or was their extraordinary success based on cheating. I just can't take the book's advice seriously given the track record of several of the companies studied. Maybe if you're passionate about being the best, and you want to be the best in the world, and make tons of money doing it [your hedgehog]- you break the rules to get ahead?? Not the advice I'm looking for...."
3301,1,"One of the worst books I have ever read. It comes off very contrived and agenda driven. He dedicates full paragraphs to pronouncing his terms correctly and restates the same concepts multiple times.Four of his so called ""GREAT"" companies are1. Fannie Mae (mortgage scandal)2. Circuit City (declared bankruptcy)3. Wells Fargo ($25B bailout)4. Gillette (bought by Proctor & Gamble).He completely disregards tech companies, and only looks at publicly traded companies. Granted private companies aren't as forth coming with their financial information but he has excluded a very large percentage of companies. He does defend this decision after the epilogue in the ""Frequently Asked Questions"" section. In the end he only succeeds in explaining why this book should have never been written/read; if you exclude all that data from you research it's not very convincing or accurate.The bulk of the book is anecdotes, platitudes, and defensive allusions to previous and better business writers (most often Stephen R. Covey). I'm amazed this man was even able to get published.I think this book is a testament to the business world's search for the next new fad that will come and go quickly. This ironically Collins speaks against in his book."
3302,1,"I wanted to like this, I really did. Amy Sherman-Palladino is great, I loved Gilmore Girls and was expecting a lot from this, but the first episode was filled with unnecessary raunch. I tried to finish it, but it just wasn't even interesting enough for me to overlook the inappropriate trash that was laced through it and try to watch it. When you can't even get through the first episode of a show without being both bored and disgusted, it's not worth your time."
3303,1,This show is not I Repeat IS NOT FUNNY. It tries WAY to hard and falls flat on its unfunny face. It's about a Jewish family that's all uptight and nervous.I gave it two shows and gave up. There are a ton of people who get this show I am not one of them.Watch the first 20 mins if you don't like it in that span you will not like it.
3304,3,"Shocked that this has nearly all 5stars. Nowhere told me that there would be nudity multiple times in the first episode alone. Would have a appreciated a heads up to that. Guess that's what makes a show good now-a-days. The setting and acting were good, but I'm not a fan of watching naked women flaunt and hearing such trashy talk. I understand that means nothing to others, but for those who don't want to watch trashy content, I'm giving you a heads up!"
3305,3,"Abounding in stereotypes, the whole show glosses over real issues of gender, class, and race under the not-so-subtle banner of a very one-dimensional, stereotypical brand of ""feminism."" While femism has progressed to questions of inter-sectionality, etc. this show invokes the most crudely glaring cliches of early feminism as if inventing them for the first time. Everything you hated about Palladino's character Rory in Gilmore Girls resurface in Mrs. Maisel with a vengeance - and no hint of self-awareness."
3306,2,"Oh how funny, within the first 5 minutes a fat shaming joke. Something like ""my roommate was friendly and fat, haha I had someone to eat with and who wouldn't steal my boyfriend!""Immediately made me unlike the main character, and reminded me of the Gilmore Girls revival pool scene with the fat neighbor, Pat, was it? The Gimore pair was cringing at the sight of him in his bathing suit as they lounged and he made small talk. He seemed friendly too!So, I will pass. This might be funny for snots."
3307,3,"In a word, absurd. In two words, Politically Correct, or at least as politically correct as you could expect a Jack Ryan story to be. Jim Greer is a muslim. Who knew? Jack gets reluctantly forced into the field, and in one situation he shoots and kills a terrorist. It seems like he's about ready to cry, especially perplexing given his backstory as a United States Marine who had been deployed to Afghanistan. Then there are the subplots, the most nauseating one involving a drone pilot who has a crisis of conscience about ridding the world of murderous terrorists. Then he takes a few days off to travel to Syria to make amends to the father of one of his ""victims."" The stupidity doesn't end there, sadly. Even sadder is the fact that the cast is pretty solid, including a few very talented and respected actors. I was especially dismayed to see Abbie Cornish slumming in the role of Dr. Love Interest. She's better t;han this. The production values are very good, while the writing and stories are anything but. Kinda funny to laugh at, if you're in the mood, but more often than not it's just annoying to bear witness to the expedient depths to which the writers will sink, insulting the intelligence of the viewer and detaching from any sense of reality, in order to keep the plot rolling along. Definitely not worthy of the Tom Clancy name or of all the hype that preceded the premiere of the series."
3308,3,"It is shameful that this production is about 5-10% away from being stellar. It needed a few percentage points more in: Realism, Writing, and thus Money to bring it all together. That the production went on the cheap virtually destroyed the legacy of the late Mr. Clancy.Here are just a few examples where the tiniest bit of change would have made a tremendous difference:A US Army Huey flying into the Black Site? Come on. The US Army has none of these in inventory and if you found one somewhere on a TO&E, you wouldn't send it to a BLACK site.Oh, a BLACK site is named as such because it is off the books. We don't want anyone to know it is administered by the US so we have plausible deniability or at the minimum, can keep it secret. We also will not have US Soldiers stationed there as guards who are wearing big US (red, white, and blue) flags on their chests! Finally, if we had a military black site like this in the middle of nowhere (where apparently we pay bounties for terrorists we killed in our own drone strikes), we would have a defense in depth like you cannot imagine. This would include a long serpentine vehicle sally port so you know, the terrorists couldn't explode a car bomb up agains the gate to breach it. Since it happened at the Black Site, I will also mention that interrogating someone with 20 people in the room is beyond stupid, adds no value to the story line, and 2% of additional thought on this matter would have made for a better episode.A little bit more writing an realism would have had Greer firing Ryan for disobeying him on his first week in the job. Greer coulda rehired him back totally in line with the plot. However, let me assure you the CIA doesn't allow blatant insubordination of this type.A little bit more thought would have revealed that we didn't need to add to Jack's backstory and capability by making him active duty for 6 years and a combat veteran. There was much to be said that Tom Clancy had him injured during summer training while in college. Jack was JUST a civilian and NOT a combat veteran. He tried to serve in uniform but found his service out of uniform in civilian service to our nation. But, if you gotta change the story this way, at least promote the poor guy. To be a lieutenant after 6 years of active service makes him the worst officer in US Military History.I will ignore the tactics simply because this is 2018 and the public is oblivious to them. That said, Tom Clancy did not. You learned something you didn't know both tactically and strategically in every story he told. It is beyond belief that a bunch of terrorists could breach a heavily fortified Black Site with 5 Isuzu trucks, a VBIED, and a few nuclear tipped RPGs ... and then escape with their raid's objective. No pursuit? No drones or other aviation assets available? No QRF ready to help if crap goes sideways? No dynamically redirected Keyhole Satellite to keep an eye on the escaping terrorists?Yep, just a few percentage points away from greatness. You missed it by /-----/ much.This was after watching the first episode only. And, I was generous in my critique. If it gets better, I will amend my review.

The story is so weak that we sat watching in pain predicting everything that happens in the story. There are occasional moments were this disaster ties the story back to things you already know based on books and movies, but they are very low key and very occasional. The drone operator story is even more anti-American PC nonsense and fits no where in the story just like the soft porn sex.All in all, an incredible failure!"
3310,3,"When I saw a Tom Clancy series advertised on Amazon Prime months ago, I was so excited, I couldn't wait until it came out. I thought, finally, a great show I can watch that won't be full of nudity and sex! But no, my eyeballs were once again assalted against my will in episode 2, and when I read the reviews here, I found that it does, indeed, continue. This series is not true Tom Clancy's writing, and I don't even know who to be angry with. Did he give Hollywood permission for this? Why does Hollywood think everyone is okay with that? I'm finding more and more that there are so many people who are sick and tired of nudity and sex on t.v. every time we try to watch a show. So unbelievably disappointed."
3311,2,"First thing I noticed was the cursing. Totally unnecessary and makes the characters sound stupid.Second is the nudity. Also totally unnecessary... and there is one scene (so far) in episode three that makes no sense and only serves to make an Air Force drone pilot look bad.Third, the series deviates so far from the books and the movies that Tom Clancy must be rolling over in his grave in an attempt to push his way out so he can sue the producers of this garbage. For instance, Jack Ryan's character is supposed to be an analyst who has no desire to be a field man... so this whole ""wolf"" business is totally wrong. Him getting getting sent for by a helicopter, taking the CIA jet overseas (more than once) and riding helos into military compounds (that don't exist? Pure fantasy...) is so far out of Ryan's character that it makes it impossible to like the series.Unfortunately, it doesn't end there. Greer's character is going through a divorce, apparently. Oh, and he's a Muslim? Seriously? Because he converted for his wife? Oh... and he and Ryan don't get along. Greer doesn't know or trust Ryan (after three episodes, anyway). And Greer's being held back? This is so moronic and off track from the books (and movies) it's just plain frustrating to watch.I get the whole bit about wanting us to see things from two sides, but this is not presenting both sides. Some Hollywood lib who probably graduated with a degree from a California university in religious studies is probably the storyboard person or the screenwriter. America, bad (with a few exceptions)... Muslims good (with few exceptions). Please!I gave it three episodes and am extremely disappointed with the way the story has taken this hard left. I may watch more, but certainly won't binge. And I'll be FFwd through the trash. And if the story doesn't come back to center soon, I'll abandon this junk and tune into something decent and not hell bent on trashing Tom Clancy's brilliant plot lines."
3312,3,"Good acting, believable characters and funny, but I had to stop watching. The perverse conversations, jokes and language, and what seemed like a constant concentration on the ugly events as being the ""norm"" in life finally pushed me over the edge. For those who enjoy catastrophes and the people involved, then this is perfect. Many situations are funny, but I finally lost patience with it all."
3313,3,"Forced and contrived humor. I watched the first episode based on the high ratings in the reviews. It did not pull me in. I didn't find a single instance of humor funny. Gave it the benefit of the doubt and watched a second. Didn't help. The main characters have no chemistry. The premise that their lives got tangled based on a one-, excuse me, sixnightstands followed by pregnancy, is ridiculous. Also, opening the series with a sex scene, even though mild, is, in my view, poor in taste."
3314,1,"I watched the first season because it was something to do. Season 2 Episode 1 was hideously offensive. Animal abuse is unacceptable in any way, shape or form, and the whole dead dog routine, clearly cheaply aimed at being funny, was pushed, and pushed and pushed. It came off as animal abuse, made me loathe these two horrible human beings in the lead roles and gave the impression of an attempt to normalize adopting an animal then killing it for being inconvenient, which was the plan, before the dog was hit by a car and killed, instead, to the couple's relief. The corpse of the animal was subsequently inconvenient to these two dolts, and viewers are subjected to seeing the corpse of the dog several times--beating a dead horse storyline-wise, but also abusive to the viewer in the process. NOT FUNNY and insensitive to viewers who care about animals and/or have a moral compass. I will never, ever watch this insipid, mean-spirited show again, caution anyone with a heart or conscience not to watch it, or you'll be disturbed and upset as I was. I feel like I was blindsided by the content I was exposed to after watching the first season, which seemed okay for the most part. The writers and all involved in its production should be ashamed of themselves and have crossed a line, which is saying a lot, since a lot of content these days dances along the line of inappropriate ethically. I hope the show tanks and there is no season 3. How could you even publish this tripe on Prime, Amazon? Did any of the content decision makers ever pause for a moment to watch this episode before publishing? I'd think not. Very irresponsible and disrespectful to Prime viewers. Someone should be accountable for this."
3315,3,"First season is great, the second one is indescribably bad after the first two episodes. Who are all these extra people that have been added and why should we care about them? Also, what in the world happens to Rob's sunny personality? The show goes from funny, to perplexing, to a little bit disgusting--and ultimately a little scary. Rob=Patrick Bateman???"
3316,2,"Liked it at first, but 3rd season was so bad, I've had enough of the profound narcissism and immaturity. It's just not at all funny anymore. All characters are extremely unlikable losers. Dialog tries to shock with banal humor (will appeal to juveniles). The fact that this show is still so popular is a testament to the poor emotional health of societies both British and American. Narcissism is NOT funny. Just try living with it."
3317,1,"If one could even believe the premise...Hopefully no sane American could... Consider 10+ hours (season 1) to develop what could be done by competent producers and directors in 3 hours; Amazon excels in the drag on and on genre. Blatantly missing is an intro statement ala Star Wars recapping the true historical events and then introducing the concept of 'what if?'. More worrisome is that poorly-read and history-ignorant viewers might actually not react to the vision presented of the ashes of incinerated (certainly while alive and breathing) mentally deficient, elderly and infirm people, spewing across the Midwestern countryside in real time....Folks, this production posits that those ashes also would include anyone not white as well as all Jews and their relatives in 1962 America because Nazi Germany, under Hitler, had a very specific agenda to purge society of 'undesirables'. Very unsavory. A most distressing concept, all in all. Not worthy of your valuable time."
3318,3,Watched first episode with my wife because she heard good reviews. She couldn't stay awake. I watched the first episode through. The episode does not stand on its own. Plot seemed to meander from one bad event to another without any clear purpose or end point. Strikes me as the sort of program where I might expect subplots to start tying together after several episodes but I was not drawn in. I think there are enough similar but more realistic programs with the same general theme that deal with post WWII Communism. 3rd Reich history with extermination and cremation of portions of the population was horrific enough; we don't need another fictional version of its continuation.
3319,3,"First a disclaimer: I have not read the Phillip K. Dick novel so this review is based solely on the ten-episode Season One of HIGH CASTLE. What I liked: beautiful photography though the early episodes stressed a dark mood where even in daylight there was little sun. The acting was the strongest point and I was surprised to learn that some of the ""American"" actors are in fact British. Some complained that the pacing was boring but I disagree. The pacing was deliberate and a relief from the technique where the editing requires a change of shot every five seconds. This frantic editing suggests to me that the filmmakers believe the viewers have an attention spam of a five year-old so if they don't keep things hopping constantly they will lose their audience. So my wife and I watched all ten episodes mainly thanks to these qualities.Now what I disliked: though the novel may clarify some story points, a film adaptation should stand on its own without the need for viewers to reference the novel to find out what's going on. I can accept the premise of the Axis Powers winning WWII for storytelling purpose, but we are left on our own to figure out how. In passing we hear that the atomic bomb was dropped on Washington, D.C. and that FDR was assassinated. I am willing to ""suspend my disbelief"" in the cause of fiction but the Germans were never at a point where such things were even on the drawing boards. It is well established that Hitler had no trans-oceanic ambitions, i.e., invading America, during his lifetime. But OK, I will happily suspend my disbelief for entertainment's sake. All I ask is that the tale proceed logically. It is this failure in logical storytelling that is HIGH CASTLE's biggest failure and the reason why I give it two stars.When an author needs to get his characters from one situation into another but doesn't know how to make this transition logically, he cheats. In other words, he just does it and leaves it to the reader or viewer to figure out how it happened. Without giving away any story points, I will just say that HIGH CASTLE has several such ""cheats"" and none worse than in the final scenes of episode 10. We see what happens but we don't know how or why it happens. Come on producers, you want us to watch and to suspend our disbelief. OK, fair enough. But don't insult your viewers by cheating in your storytelling because you can't figure out how to transition your characters to where you need them to be. I hesitate to spen dtime watching Season Two, if there is a Season Two."
3320,3,"So, The Man In The High Castle is set in an America that lost WW2. In the pilot, our main characters learn that there are two films that apparently show an America that WON the war, made by The Man In The High Castle.And immediately the questions raised for the audience and the leads are:Who is the Man In The High Castle?How did the films come to be made? Is it the work of special effects?Is there a way to go into that (our) world in which America won the war?Nicely done pilot.And then for the remainder of the season, no one wonders any of these things! WTF?!The promise made in the pilot is that this show will follow the protagonists as they try to learn who the Man In The High Castle is and the antagonists (the Japs and the Nazis) try to stop them, presumably to somehow stop the “America winning” version of history from becoming a reality or at least to stop the films from being used as propaganda.But instead, what follows is muddled and pointless.By episode 9, no one is even a half step closer to finding the answers to the questions raised in the pilot. A lot of people seem to want to get these films, but we don’t know why. Literally 75% of the series has nothing to do with the films.Finally in the last two minutes of episode 9, we see a portion of a film. It appears to show the future and one of the supporting characters dying. And again the dramatic questions are raised.And then more questions are raised in the final episode, but not by the protagonists because they are not privy to the same information as the audience is. They remain exactly where they were after the pilot, not an inch closer to finding the truth.The show is a striking misfire and a dreadful bore. Shocking really.Rufus Sewell, the main Nazi, could very well be the best actor on the little screen though."
3321,1,"I really wanted to like this, and if I'd known the source material, maybe I would have liked it, or at least better, but now we'll never know.Five episodes in and so far it makes no sense. If it is urgent that Frank show up for his factory job at the totalitarian world, why is his friend able to cover for him with no reprisals? Doesn’t exactly help us believe in the high stakes of retribution/world closing in on him.Why would you have so relative little action between the Japanese and German overlord characters? Isn't this setup a prime conflict ground?Frank’s friend says it is “urgent” that Juliana get back to town – in 1962, mind; what does he want her to do - hope aboard a space satellite at Cape Carnaveral? Juliana is traveling somewhere in the wilds of small town open Americana, on the slow bus, and kicked off the bus in the middle of nowhere by Japanese soldiers – 2 minutes later she is arriving in her home town, no explanation as to how (unless I fell asleep and missed an episode – I really don’t think I did), and the gaping prior bullet wound Frank had 2 minutes ago, is mysteriously 100% healed?This is ridiculous. Don’t waste your time."
3322,1,"I have only made it through 5 episodes. However, I had to watch several of the shows multiple times. The show is so boring that I cannot keep my mind on it and thus the need to rewatch it and rewatch scenes. It is like reading a boring book that the school has assigned. I find my mind wandering to other things and then realizing that I missed the entire scene. I love Maggie Smith and her character is one of the few that can command my attention. There is nothing uplifting in the first five episodes. There is an unhappiness that is weaved throughout most of the characters... just when one thinks that something good/positive might happen, it gets ruined. I would not recommend this show unless you thrill at the emotional pain of others. Everyone seems stuck in their life and hating it. I get enough of that in reality."
3323,3,"Streamed on Amazon Prime ... between the poor acoustics and the strong British accents, it was unintelligible. I only watched about five minutes before it got to be too much work. I couldn't get closed captioning because CC isn't supported (by Amazon) for my 2013 Vizio TV model. The Vizio does CC quite well through the cable box, so the problem isn't in the TV set."
3324,3,"If I could give it a negative 3 stars, I would. This had to be the most agonizingly boring show ever produced. It would win an emmy for ""Most Dramatic Pause"" if that was a category. How anyone can sit thru an entire episode without drinking a bottle of Drano, I'll never know. How it has actually stayed on the air for multiple seasons proves once and for all that the Lord has a grand sense is humor. My wife likes it though."
3325,3,"Everyone has always urged me to watch Downton Abbey, telling me that I would just love it... So last month I started and managed to get through the first 8 episodes but the cast went from one disaster and crisis to another and I found it terribly depressing.. Just when I thought their lives couldn't get worse, the war started.. That was it!!!I"
3326,3,"This poor review has nothing to do with the outstanding Downton Abbey series and applies only to issues we experienced with the Amazon Prime streaming video service. When we watched Season 1, Episode 1, there was a strange periodic slowdown/speed-up in the streaming video that made it very difficult to watch. After a half hour or so, that issue became less and less noticeable. We had never previously experienced this sort of issue on Amazon Prime streaming video. Later, when we attempted to start Season 1 , Episode 2, Amazon Prime would not let us watch it without paying, despite the fact that we are Amazon Prime members. Get your act together Amazon!"
3327,2,"I watch hoping that the next episode will get better but it leaves me wanting. There is no complexity in this show - not in the characters or the plot. No surprises, no character development. Very 2-dimensional. Maybe millenials would appreciate it more than I do but I can't see what there is to like. It's a soap opera set in a law firm but don't expect to gain any insight into the world of law. The script is shallow, the characters are shallow, the dialogue is laden with sound bites from some strange sub-culture I am not familiar with. This show is nothing like LA Law and The Good Wife where you can be entertained AND learn something about the characters and the law. Does Suits even have a legal consultant? I can't imagine that any female Harvard lawyer would dare enter a courtroom looking like a these women do and I can't imagine any Harvard women being willing to work in this environment of sexual harassment. In Suits it all about the clothing, the hair, the cleavage and the sex. That said, they do it well. It's just not worth my time. If there's nothing better to watch, I'd rather read a book."
3328,3,"After watching 2 episodes, I was shocked this show was rated as high as it was. Especially with so many good TV shows out now. This seemed Very cliche . The storylines are very predictable.The characters lack depth and are not very lovable. It almost seems like the writers are forcing them down our throats. But... I'm only in the first season and this show has multiple seasons so I guess something changed along the way."
3329,3,"I get it. The lawyers are supposed to be super bright... the best of the best, or something to that effect. But, the smugness and attitude is too much. Every move is calculated and, apparently, near perfect in execution. Opposing lawyers and people are basically dolts and easily misled. I love courtroom dramas, but what makes them interesting is that it's not a forgone conclusion who will win, or how. Not so with Suits. They will win. The awards will be astoundingly huge (e.g., a settlement for $400 million is shrugged off as 'normal'). I can take the lead character, Harvey, for only so many minutes before it gets to be too much.None of the other characters bring much - they are all paper cut outs."
3330,3,This show is honestly horrible. The characters don't make a single bit of sense and are constantly changing how they act. One minute the weirdo smart guy is a big tough guy standing up to people. Painfully unrealistic. Not to mention it is filled with nonsense jargon. Imagine if you took Mad Men and it had a bastard child with Big Bang Theory. That's what this is..
3331,1,"I was particularly disappointed after the rave reviews this show received. I can accept some implausible; after all I really liked the first seasons of Blacklist and Person of Interest. This however, the idea that a highly prestigious firm would hire someone who never attended law school, then proceed to encourage him to lie about it is ludicrous. Also, the show is very poorly acted by 90 percent of the cast. I have seen high school productions with better acting. Don't waste your time."
3332,2,"An unlikely loser up against a monolithic corporation that has buried the truth. Have we seen anything like this before? To drag out this cliched story for eight episodes is a travesty compounded by mistakes we cannot believe even the most foolish loser would make. This could have been a B- movie worth 90 minutes or 2 hours. It is NOT in the league with I Claudius, Therese Raquin, or Nicholas Nickleby which deserved the multi-part episode treatment. As such I watched the first episode ONLY and would not waste my time with the rest."
3333,3,"The absolute worst closed captioning I have ever seen. If you depend on closed captioning give this a pass. It almost seems as though they had been given a earlier draft. What you see almost ""dumbed down"" and does not match what is being said on screen. The closed captioning also seems to ""run behind"", you are reading well into the change, with no actors visible.."
3334,3,"There is something too over the top here. In the first episode he meets a ""girl"" in a bar and we think ... What? Only to find out the young woman is his junior in high school daughter. Yes, she is 16 or 17 and meets her father in a bar? What is worse is that she looks 25. Believe me, as a high school teacher I can safely say she does not look anything like high school girl. This strained credibility to the breaking point. This is a show trying to look bad for the viewers but only ends up looking silly."
3335,3,"A formula for the drunk lawyer who takes on the long shot for the good of humanity and then loads of actor/models, reading bad scripts and making it worse. Billy Bob plays Billy Bob and he's good at it but because his schtick is being sour and pissed off all the time, gets me down. I know this will never be published but really only of the amusement of the person who has to read it and hit delete."
3336,1,"Don’t bother. I watched the whole thing. The only good thing in it is the stray dog. Watch Better Call Saul instead. That gets the legal process right and has a better plot. Still has an anti-hero attorney, smart women co-attorneys, an older crazy mentor attorney ass, and criminals. With dead bodies and impossible situations right and left, but Better Call Saul is funny, more believable, and has more heart. Oh and Better Call Saul has better cinematography."
3337,3,"Love the show and I wanted to download to one of my computers for my husband. Right now its views on amazon. It buffers a lot on amazon. When I am on Hulu, I don't have any buffering problems so I know its not my computer. Amazon's help list didn't do any good. Also, I noticed that I could have purchased the DVD cheaper than online."
3338,2,"The Andy Griffith Show Season One is amazing!! I just wouldn't attempt to download on a Kindle......my experience was a disaster.Yours however..may be just fine.Ordered this digital version through ""One click"" on my Kindle. On my Prime acct.That was a smooth transaction. (as always) No issue there. Never has been.The trouble began when i attempted to ""download this series onto my Kindle for offline viewingin my Library. It took FOREVER to download anything at ALL. and when it FINALLY registered it was finished..I found out there was NOTHING on my machine.The two shows that did eventually make it on there..had to be deleted. They kept reloading every 3 seconds.They simply were not watchable this way.I will ""now"" have to order the DVDs of this first season, since so far I have ""nothing"".Newer shows will download.....yet they STILL take forever. (35 minutes to download a 27 minute program) I will not try to download any more older or classic ones.Sadly, just not a great experience.."
3339,3,"Paramount once again cheats the world of even standard DVD treatment of a tv show or movie. This DVD package has 32 episodes of Andy Griffith--that's it. No subtitles, no commentary, no inclusion of the Danny Thomas Show that launched the Andy Griffith character, no discussion or information about the show, no special features, no nothing. This show is a treasure of Americana, and Paramount goes the laziest, greedy route (the V.P.'s at Paramount and Universal home entertainment divisions must continually compete to see who can do the worst job and still turn a buck) and simply slaps their celluloid onto a DVD and send it down to Mexico to get mass reproduced. Pathetic."
3340,3,"$74.96 for one season on blu ray? Are these people on dope? I love the show, but not that much. Let's face it, it's in black and white so the dvd version is good enough for me."
3341,3,"Bought the whole series of eight seasons. Season one was damaged. Plastic bits were scattered inside, also the plastic sleeve that held the four CDs was broken off, with the cds rattling around loose in the case. Disk one had scratches on it."
3342,3,Know it was highly rated and I am still watching to give it a chance but sadly I don't like this program at all. too slow; I don't Like or care about any of the characters. Every person is a stereotype including the slack face open eye corpse. Will continue to watch but it's painful.
3343,1,"What a M F'ing piece of idiotic garbage! This is what passes for F'ing drama? Do people really think this is how F'ing cops, lawyers and judges interact? A constant level of hostility and profanity is not good writing or acting. If this is even remotely an accurate depiction of Baltimore then I recommend nuking the city now. But of course it is just the fantasy drivel of a couple jack off Mo F'ing hack writers (see how quickly that sounds dumb?). I suppose the secret to the popularity of this Mo F'ing nonsense is the low collective IQ of people willing to pay for HBO."
3344,2,"Watch only if you want to be confused! The characters talk in slang ( those in the "" hood "" as well as the police), and they talk fast. We had to turn on the CC to see what was said, and found we had missed half the dialog. Looks well filmed, but sometimes I just want to relax and be entertained, not to have to "" read "" my show. Will not be following further episodes."
3345,2,"After about ten minutes of non-stop, foul-mouthing by what I assume are the ""good guys"" in this series, I knew it was not something that would entertain or enliven, inspire or uplift, so that was the first-and-last episode of THE WIRE for me. There is more than enough of the crude, profane, obscene, and disgusting in the news and the world at large.. Why anyone would choose to spend precious personal time immersing him or herself in such unapologetic, unrelenting squalor of mind and spirit is beyond me. If THE WIRE is ""true to life,"" then it represents a reality about which I do not wish to know more. As one who loves the English language, I find the dialogue in this program to be in a language almost wholly foreign to me and my experience over a long lifetime - a language with no redeeming social, intellectual, spiritual, or artistic value. Those who speak this foreign tongue are so alien to my world and do such violence to decent, civil, human expression that I find any further voluntary submission to such unpleasant verbal assaults unthinkable. I have no idea what the plot(s) might have been but was unwilling to spend one moment more with the thoroughly distasteful characters who introduced the story lines. They made me want to seek other company - FAST - so I did. . ."
3346,2,"I had high hopes for this show when I first started watching it based upon reviewer ratings but found it very difficult to get through the first season due to the slowness of it. Every aspect of this show (at least in the first season) is long and drawn out. So much so, that after finishing the first season, I was barley able to wake up from my coma. So in the interest of not wasting my time I will not be watching anymore of the seasons."
3347,3,"Characters lack depth and each character could be played by most anybody without making much difference in the series. You don't feel ""drawn"" to any character unlike Vikings series. Aside from that, there are far too many ""F"" bombs, along with sex, violence, war, desensitization of heads and limbs being cut off, and very heavy into occult. If you decide to watch - don't expect the equivalent of a Tolkien ""fantasy."" It's not a fantasy series at all as others have stated. In fact, it is the embodiment of everything that is wrong with Hollywood, all wrapped up into one."
3348,3,"I had been looking forward to this series for a while, that is until I watched the first episode. This is highly sensationalized fantasy mocking history. There have been so many historical dramas that have been well written and directed. Some have worked hard at being as accurate as possible and others have taken liberties. But one thing they all tried hard to do was be believable. Being that this show is promoted as a historical docu-drama, the fantasy element is completely inappropriate, especially when there was no effort to even try to hold true to place names and events. All the magical nonsense depicted here and the horrible dialogue and directing made this series a major disappointment. Fantasy is great when it is not trying to imitate a historical drama and when the writing and directing are good. I hope this show gets cancelled bc it is not a docu-drama, it is fantasy. Had it been promoted as fantasy and the tribal and state players were represented by fictional names, I could give it at least 3 stars. I find it terrible that more people are not criticizing this shows gross misrepresentations of history. Another sad clue that people no longer value the truth as long as they are being entertained and the biases are being confirmed."
3349,1,"Garbage. Not even going to start on the incredible disregard for any historical accuracy. This show tries to be everything at once, and fails. Terrible acting and dialogue, and projection of modern PC culture onto a very decidedly non-PC ancient world. I was trying to give it a chance, but it totally lost me when a teenage girl in a night gown murders 5 trained, fully armed and armored legionaries with a dagger in face-to-face combat. I couldn't even finish the first episode.This could have been amazing. You really dropped the ball, Amazon. You took what has been ruining Game of Thrones for the past 4 seasons and doubled down on it. The money wasted for this trash should have been given to pick-up HBO's Rome for a few more seasons."
3350,3,"Starting out, we were extremely excited about this series. However we, like MANY OTHER PEOPLE, are just sick of having to witness hyper-real torture scenes, ghoulish murder scenes and blood-spattered everything. I am very well-read and I understand the time period this series is set in and the barbaric practices that took place. That doesn’t mean that I want to vicariously live through the horrors through a tv show. I don’t mind allusion to the violence but it truly makes a tragic statement about our society when people actually want to see and ENJOY seeing human beings being tortured mercilessly.Amazon, you are disregarding an enormous segment of potential viewers by pandering only to the gore-craving segment of your audience. If Britannia had been less gruesome, I’d have given it 5 stars."
3351,1,"I SO wanted to like this show! I really really REALLY did!! But to ask me to suspend belief and reality at this grand a scale is impossible!Britannia is nothing more than yet ANOTHER politically correct show where women were in control of EVERYTHING: they were the decision-makers, hunters, warriors, super-heroes that can kill highly trained men with ease while having no training and inferior weapons, etc. They were portrayed as everything they weren't in real life! It's yet ANOTHER show where men are inferior, weak, and incompetent, and women were cast as being the actual chieftains and history-makers!! I mean, give me a break!Starting with the opening theme.....I mean WTH?! WHAT were the producers thinking?!?! (whoever thought this was proper should be hanged; drawn & quartered; then fed to the gators!) Then there's the equipment (Romans wearing combat boots?), props (glassware in a combat zone?), over-the-top druid mannerisms (the head shaman with metal eyelets on his fingertips, etc), and lexicon that's totally off (all manner of historically inaccurate words and phrases, etc.). Then there's the matter of a plump-lipped, perfectly-straight and super-white-toothed, long-lashed, green-eyed black 'legionary' that looks like he was plucked out of a Muscle & Fitness magazine, and the list of nightmares is endless (and this is only Episode 1 I'm talking about!). I mean, COME ON!!!!! Enough with this historically inaccurate, PC shi....stuff already! WE'RE NOT BUYING IT!!!Look, the druids (both in the show and in real life) were trash, and one can't help but cheer that historically, the Romans DID come to Britain and slaughtered these nasty ancient hippies!!! Do yourself a favor and jump off a bridge before watching this pathetic show!The Good: Not watching this abortion of a showThe Bad: That this show was ever producedThe Ugly: Most of the Barbarian cast, and the show itself!"
3352,2,"Is this written by some millennial that thinks its really cool and artistic to not be able to tell a story chronologically from beginning to end like humanity has been doing for thousands of years. Its fine once or twice to go back a year or two, but to randomly go back 7 years, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and back to now... wait, is it now or is it still the past.... geeeez. Just tell the damn story already. I gave up. If I have to think that much about whether I am watching the past or present every 5 minutes, forget. Turn your head and miss the ""7 years ago"" subtitle and you're screwed. The screenwriters need to get a life. I wouldn't watch this to the end if you paid me."

Crazy woman traveled to the middle of nowhere to find out herself what happened... Not my cup of tee!"
3354,3,"Only made it into 1/3 of the second episode, exotic scenery is about all it has going for it. Deception [now named Ruby Cairo, I guess there were too many movies with that name and someone paid the original to give up the name? This mystery is more interesting that this disaster] with Andie Mcdowell and Liam Neeson is the same plot, same characters with slightly different locations tells the same story without dragging it out for 8 episodes. I guess in this era of ""peak TV"" it's becoming difficult to come up with any original ideas."
3355,3,"I really wanted to like the show because of the actors Kate Beckinsale and Charles Dance. Her character is so annoyingly arrogant. She walks out alone into jungle,really<U+0001F631>. Totally ridiculous. Once again a story selling the idea white people can do anything they want in Africa. So absolutely tried of that dialogue."
3356,1,"I honestly cannot remember the last time I watched anything this inane & depressing! I found the premise - the possibility that a man reported dead in a horrific plane crash & still grieved by his widow after 3 years, might be alive - rather enticing & the first few episodes with their improbable yet intriguing cliffhanger endings kept me watching... But it all proved to be an idiotic, morbidly dark & boring farce! People dying right and left all as a result of a middle aged woman getting jilted by her lesbian lover. If seeing gratuitous lesbian sex scenes with older woman is your thing then by all means go for it. Otherwise don't waste your time! There's so much great stuff out there to watch instead... (The system here would not accept a review without at least 1 star. I don't think this series deserves even that but let that one star be for the shots of the Rotterdam skyline... the few seconds of anything redeeming amidst hours of horrible footage!)."
3357,3,"Sorry...I tried. I gave it the 10 minute rule and could only do 7. Intel shows are great but was this vetted by the Agency? Should you really go into detail about NOC operations. The problem is the CIA is so starved for Hollywood to take a tour of HQS that they probably paid for the pilot. Lead is another skinny suit pretty millennial. The current events folk music ballads are tiring and dull.King in High Castle is the only one that works. It is so sad how bad the ideas/concepts are in the USA., especially with Amazon. Nothing is good. Thank GOD for The Affair and Walking Dead."
3358,2,"Although the cast had several very recognizable good actors, the story was to bazaar for my tastes. For me it had long periods of boredom with a random act of violence thrown in. The humor just did not work. I will not be watching another episode. I saw that Gil Bellows was the producer and writer in the credits. I like him as an actor but he should stick to acting."
3359,2,"I'm really impressed with most of Amazon's original content, from Bosch to Hand of God to Man in the High Castle, but this one couldn't hold my attention. This pilot is like random images shoved together in a meaningless fashion frosted with awful acting and worse writing. One second the hero (anti-hero?) is a depressed musician strumming oddball folk music and the next he's shoving an innocent man in front of a bus ostensibly so he can get an undercover job in order to illicitly travel to Iran. In one scene he convinces a business executive to piss in a cup for him so that he can pass a drug test simply by saying he's a secret agent with no proof whatsoever and the guy is so enamored with the idea that he strips for him later on. WTF?! As a business executive and rational human being, I assert that in real life this bozo would be out on his butt or, more likely, in jail right now. The writing is rancid, the acting is horrific, and I found the entire thing surprisingly un-watchable and, frankly, embarrassing. I'd give it zero stars if I could. I couldn't even finish it."
3360,1,"First boring, slow. They are mostly playing guitars and singing songs that are not even remotely funny. Just stupid. Talking throughout movie with there family's,and playing stupid songs. Discussing their jobs in the bathroom get it suppose to be funny, just looks what stupid.this is one of the most idiotic films I have ever seen."
3361,3,"Sorry - really didn't like this show at all. Too slow and confusing at getting to the point/plot/set up. There were some creative hopeful moments where I thought it could take off, but it just kept dragging along. There aware 3 of us watching and we all agreed we couldn't take it anymore and left the show about 40 minutes in."
3362,3,"I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the DVDs. I am now into my second one, and both so far have been extremely difficult to watch due to the numerous places the recording freezes. I've tried more than one player, and the same issue occurs. The story line is good, and I am enjoying it on the ones that do play."
3363,3,"If there is anything worse than throw a story out there and not resolving it or closing it, I can easily see why this series didnt make it. You get interested in the plot (one of many) and they just drop it. Nothing said about the story at all they just move on to another story line... frankly, all the praise for this series is very misguided. I'm tell you now it sure ain't no MENTALIST."
3364,2,"The beginning of season one is good. The legal issues that Nick finds himself involved it at the clinic are interesting and the acting is excellent. The show is fast paced and has several story lines going at once. I can only give it one star, however, because as the show moves farther into the season sex is added to the plots (I shouldn't be surprised) and it's totally unnecessary. Some of the language is offensive, as well. What a disappointment. We've quit watching."
3365,1,"From the start the plot tries so hard to paint the main character as a heroic attorney without giving reasons for it. In the first episode he goes against these young probably below middle class entrepreneurs which from my point of view does NOT make him a ""Guardian."" He runs away from a court hearing like a retarded person very disconnected to reality. He sounds like a sadomasochist who likes to inflict pain on others to later apologize. This how sucks!"
3366,2,"I love Simon Baker and usually everything he does, even though I still think of him as Patrick Jane. But,this series is just hard for me to watch. It is always depressing and usually ends badly. I understand that it is trying to portray real life. But, I watch TV for a little bit of an escape. If I want realism I can just turn the TV off and deal with my own problems. I hate that this is not a great show for me because I was really excited to find something with Simon Baker as the star and I was looking forward to watching all the seasons. As it is, I only got to Season 1 episode 5 before I just couldn't take anymore. Maybe I can finish them later on."
3367,3,"The premise of this show made me think I would love it, but it was very poorly executed. The deceased ex-wife is constantly berating and belitting her ex-husband from beyond the grave. He's an extremely successful doctor and she constantly shows up to deride him for not carrying on HER dream of running a clinic for low-income patients. She basically guilts him into doing both his job and hers. I'd say he should be stretched quite thin from all of this, but as other reviewers have pointed out, this show is very much like a soap opera. A terrible diagnosis and the surgery to fix the problem can all be taken care of in the same day. And I haven't finished all the episodes, but I've yet to see the good doctor be anything other than miraculous in his success rate.I was just looking for something light to watch while I got some knitting done. I wasn't looking for a show that I would need to be very invested in, or one that I would necessarily want to keep my eyeballs glued to. Just wanted something light to listen to while I knitted. This works okay for that, but I'm not sure if I'll finish the rest of the episodes or not. I really dislike how the ghost character treats her ex-husband. That well-paid job that she belittles him for is what enables him (more than once) to have the cash on hand and the prestige of position to bail out her struggling clinic. Despite the ghost character's attempts to shame her ex-husband into doing more of his work for free, she is the one that comes across to me as quite selfish."
3368,1,"I was really enjoying this refreshing new medical melodrama up through episode 5. The overlapping people stories were interesting, and the introduction of new medical staff with their developing stories was very well done.However, starting with episode 6, vulgar language and verbal abuse began slipping into the story. I just had to quit watching episode 7 and won't be watching anymore of this series. I don't care why the script of the storyline changed, but it did drastically. It is most unfortunate and incredibly disappointing that practically EVERY main character in the story (patients and staff) are now Vitriolic, Verbally and/or Physically Abusive, Vulgar, and Profane.I don't consider any of that malevolent behavior and storyline as entertainment. This series is ruined in my point of view. Too bad. It certainly had a good start. I cannot recommend this particular TV show.
One person found this helpful."
3369,1,"This is not the best series Amazon has supported.....his ex wife who died...... irritatingly comes back at the most inconvenient times and her comments are sometimes misplaced and she has a grin that is somewhat naive and bothersome...and odd, as a matter of fact...I never understood why she was in the show at all...Not a good story line or perhaps too obvious....rich doctor starts to take in urban, low income patients at the calling of the wife's prior job.Not worth time and not even fantasy angel type....just too obvious."
3370,2,"I was into the 6th episode of this series only to realize that the ghost (his ex wife ) was getting a wardrobe change each time she appeared. I did not know they had that capacity. This is so ludicrous I had no choice but to drop the series.There was another series ""Being Human"",that ghost had the same wardrobe that she was buried in throughout the series and that is absolutely believable . This series is off the air now, maybe there is a good reason for that. Sorry I wasted so much time watching it."
3371,3,"so cheesy. want to like this show. love Dr. Holt and the idea but the episode ""in case of complications"" made for some of the worst TV Ive seen, so fake and one crazy woman takes 4 intelligent doctors hostage and it gets more far fetched by the minute until its is all ridiculous and I just cant trust this show anymore. Bummer. And too disturbing that they are often about letting criminal behavior go un addressed out of pity for the criminal. I'm liberal and I can't even stomach this, wow."
3372,3,"Season 1 and 2 were great. Season 3 is completely different. The way they filmed it changed, the storyline stopped being funny. Too bad. It felt like season 1 and 2 was lower budget, more of a quirky indy series. Then it got attention, bigger budget, more producers, etc. and they totally ruined the show starting season 3. Great job HBO!"
3373,3,"Somewhat entertaining although totally unrealistic. The main character lives and works in the same area where he has an ex wife, two dweeb children and is a teacher and coach at the local high school. The woman he gets hooked up with are all rich and attractive, but of course if they weren't no one would watch the show. They were right to cancel this show, but they should have done it after the first season."
3374,3,"Can't say I was a huge fan of this series from seasons 1 and 2, but just felt like following along to see where it went. More betrayals (nothing new for the series), cattle rustling, flirtations with <gasp> same sex encounters and primary characters being shot all scream Jump the Shark time. One key socially relevant issue they set up beautifully and then completely missed the mark on was a case of workplace sexual harassment; that was an utter failure on the part of the writers. Ah well. I continue to think the principle actors were all game and engaging and did the best they could with the material, but the execution of the story arch fell of a cliff."
3375,3,"The first season was intriguing, and it had an interesting plot, but the 2nd & 3rd seasons were nothing but raunchy. No wonder it was cancelled after season 3. Here's a clue producers... if you have a good show that is popular, and you raunch it up and the ratings drop... then stop making things so raunchy."
3376,3,"I was really excited for this show, and it has some good elements to it: the strong, well-developed characters are the female characters, and they mostly move the action along throughout the seasons; Ray's hypermasculinity is portrayed as a bad thing instead of being celebrated (although this is simultaneously a negative element of the show, since we don't get the see Ray actually please his clients, going so far as to pressure them into continuing activities they rejected on multiple occasions); and the messages portrayed by Tanya's Wellness Center are empowering, sometimes. Lenore is 100% my favorite character, she's hilarious and powerful, I love her actress. Tanya's actress plays her character perfectly too.But I think there are too many bad elements weighing down the show to say that I really enjoyed it. When I first read the synopsis of this show, I expected it to be very progressive. I expected the protagonist to be dynamic, and to receive portrayals of his sex scenes with his clients that were genuinely sexy, sensual, and pleasing to the intended audience. But Ray is just an old, misogynist (and spoiler alert: transmisogynist) grump of a man who occasionally 'learns lessons' through his fuck-ups with women but never experiences any long term changes. He's manipulative, selfish, and entirely unappealing to listen to; I feel bad for all of his clients, having to deal with someone so unjustifiably into himself. All of the men in the show are unreliable, which I assume is an intended theme, but Ray's whole deal got real old real quick. Outside of a disappointing protagonist, the show falls short in its monotonous storyline. Ray gets a client, he and/or Tanya does something extremely inconsiderate, Lenore does something mean and unexpected, Ray gets jealous of Jason, every now and then Tanya creates problems for herself by talking to Charlie and kind of taking his advice...and then the show ended without any real resolutions."
3377,3,"Was an interesting plot but there was more nudity than we cared to see & will not watch the other episodes. We have noticed the Amazon Prime shows we have watched contain too much bad language, and therefore we are very careful in selecting these to watch, if at all. Disappointing since cable TV has vastly degenerated! It is also disappointing to be able to watch a series and then be required to pay for the following series since we are paying for the Prime services annually. Many times, especially on Friday nights, we have too much disruption in Prime's programming--program starts & stops too frequently!"
3378,3,"too fake, Jonathan seemed can do so many different things in Robert's room without any detection, there is no video camer, no cell phone checking/tracking, if 21 centure arm delaer can sale their ""toys"" in the global market, you tell me there is no real time tracking system? the video is made by cheap shot, too fake, a average 6th grade student can write a better story line than this one!"
3379,3,Started off well enough and had me committed to the series. Turned into a cheesy mini-series. Don't know why Hugh Laurie won a Golden Globe.All the characters had no depth and we were asked to believe feelings between them based on very little relationship development. The bright spot was the Corkie character. If only the rest of the characters were played similarly within their own character's world.
3380,1,What a rubbish!!! It's so bad and disappointing. I really don't understand all the fuzz at the Emmy. This series only succeed to be at the same time a cheesy romance and a living cliche about everything. It's definitely an insult to the viewer intelligence. All characters are so fake and the script is ridiculous. I don't even believe this sort of crap can still exist in 2017....
3381,3,Stank. Tom Hiddleston went from a believable guy in two episodes to a simpering smiley face emoji that no person with half a brain wouldn't have seen through. So many plot holes and ridiculous twists that if Hugh Laurie had been such a brilliant arms dealer he would have seen through in a second. The fact that a hotel room safe was an issue was also absolutely hysterical. That should be a spy's version of a Fisher Price toy.
3382,1,"This review is regarding the awful packaging of this product, and not of the merits of the show itself. Eureka is a show that you either love or hate. If you fall into the hate category, you're not going to be considering buying it anyway.The DVD trays are made out of potatoes. Really. The product is so soft, the discs will not stay in place no matter how careful you try to close the case, and they wind up slipping out of the bottom. It's sort of like a fine grain Styrofoam. The sliding around smudges the discs, and leaves tiny specks of material clinging to them.The material is supposed to be environmentally friendly. That would be great if this were a disposable product, but who buys DVD sets and throws away the packaging? I also can't imagine that this material is going to have a very long shelf life - especially if it were to get exposed to humidty and/or heat.Stoopid, stoopid, stoopid. I might have to cannibalize plastic inserts from somewhere else and glue them into the sleeve."
3383,1,"Beware Potential Amazon Prime Members!Amazon's delivery of the first few episodes of Eureka season one was adequate. But potential Prime members beware! If nothing else, Amazon is not stupid. Be prepared to watch a few episodes, but don’t be surprised if the series you are watching (in this case Eureka) is suddenly available only for purchase, outside the scope of your Prime membership. While I can find no faults with the few individual episodes we watched, we started watching the series with the expectation that we could watch it to the end without suddenly having to pay for each episode. Overall rating: One star, trending to zero."
3384,3,"The show could've been good, but the characters are too stereotypical. Just another white male in charge story. I'm not anti-guy. I'm just annoyed at the stereotypes. The guys are all brilliant inventors. The females act sexy, strong, and dangerous, but they all take orders from a bunch of white guys. When he started patronizing the female DOD agent and messing with the crime scene, it lost my interest."
3385,3,"So disappointing to watch 2 seasons for free with my PAID prime membership and now, perhaps due to popularity, I have to pay to watch the rest? What a joke.......I will look into purchasing at my local stores that sell long since retired shows at very reasonable prices. This is not funny - continue to take away the advantages to my Prime membership and that will end just like the advantages to having it have ended."
3386,1,"have watched two seasons of EUReKA and almost every ep has the same story line. Main player or players get sick or injured and have to find a way to cure them, town and/or research lab may have to be evacuated before destruction, cop yes a high school grad cop saves everyone and everything in the last five min. Is supposed to be a syfi but almost all episodes are related to paranormal, misunderstood sicence, and religion. A town full of PhDs and scientist who are imbeciles. Not worth your time."
3387,1,"Yeah, this doesn't hold up very well. The dialogue is PAINFUL and so is the acting. I remember this show being so cutting edge back in the day b/c it tackled topics about drugs, sex, peer pressure, etc. Now it just seems so wholesome, dull, and completely unrealistic in any way. The fashion disasters are hilarious, though. Biking shorts with EVERYTHING. Why??"
3388,3,"Very Wholly Weirdian throughout but within generally acceptable parameters until the script writers got into some heavy weight Wholly Weird malicious propaganda with Episodes 10 and 11. Between this pair of socially unacceptable and overtly criminal presentations, I was unwilling to continue viewing beyond the midpoint of Episode 11.Eleven was the renowned practice of poisoning the beverages of non consumers of All Co Hell to ""loosen them up"" for criminal objectives and the more general practice of poisoning children (those under the intended ""legal"" age for consuming All Co Hell) to destroy their lives before they have any chance to live them. Demonstrated the truth that the very first thing All Co Hell does is to subvert human awareness of what that brain and liver lethal toxic chemical does so that victims don't understand what's being done to them by the criminal pushers. Compounded by the naive impression of being able to ""clean up"" after a crew of drunk and disorderly poisoned puppies have been trashing one's parent's house (let aloneone's life which typically requires a minimum of four years without further All Co Hell consumption) and pretending avoidance is only a ""rules thing"". The toxin is so destructive that one of Wholly Weird's poisoned puppies went so far as to sue a financial company for using the phrase ""milkaholic"" in its advertising as if it referred to her self destructive consumption of All Co Hell.Episode Ten was a full blow reminder of the notorious ""magical"" conversion of HIV/AIDS, using a homosexual dominance ritual player known to have been subjected to nonsterile needles to treat sports injuries and most of every day in the filthy environment of ""sports"" locker rooms who was entered into a ""marriage"" to pretend he got AIDS via ""hetero"" relations, into a pretext for object rape con dumbs against heteros presented by Bush The Elder as part of the felony tax evading ""religionist"" insistence on preventing hetero connectivity in favor of the slave mongering divorce racketeering ""marriage"" swindle system and imposing the ""religionist"" hate mongering against male citizens with their ""belief"" in torturing, maiming, and murdering males as ""beneficial"" to their criminal society. While consistent with their Wholly Weird felony religionist play actor Ronny Raygun who began the felony abrogations of Article I US Constitution Amendments hetero civil rights with object rape con dumbs in 1986-87 after Wholly Weird installed that spewer of other people's lines into the Witty Houze, the felony abrogations themselves remain unacceptable as part of any social discourse."
3389,3,"I have loved everything about this show since its debut when I was in 4th grade. I used to DVR all of the reruns on TV, and I was SOOOO ecstatic to see them at a decent price on Amazon, so I quickly snatched up the first 3 seasons! To my UTTER disappointment so much of the original music had been changed!!! It's really sad to see a scene that used to have certain music in the back ground, which MADE THE WHOLE SCENE, and suddenly there's some music that's totally inappropriate for the year, and totally bastardizes the cheesy early 90's flow that made 90210 so fantastic! I was very disappointed and I wish that this was made clear to me prior to my purchase! And then they have Darren Star's commentaries and he completely ignores the fact that his show, that he's so proud of, has been edited so much that it no longer has its original appeal. Of course, I'm going to keep them because the show RULES despite the mid-90's ska music that sets the background for a bunch of kids in carry-over-80's clothing. If there HAD to be changes made, it could've been WAY more subtle (and someone should have done their research because having music that sounds like the Black Eyed Peas most recent album in the background of a club in 1990 is just ridiculous)."
3390,2,"i give it one star only on it being on DVD. Otherwise it is a really good show all the way to its last season. I need to advise anyone buying the DVDs of this show, beware......Most, if not all the music in each episode and seasons were changed, and it is complete bs!! Especially in season 3, when *spoiler, Brenda and Dylan break up and the song ""losing my religion"" plays on her radio/cassette tape....was replaced by some stupid song.....ugh i dont even know where else to go with that, ......the songs that were in all the early seasons of this show, were songs that were hits at the time---early 90's, and some if not all helped the storyline, I understand that copywiting issues are the reasons why they are not included....but to me...its is not worth the buy, maybe if others stopped buying it, the makers of the DVD will pony up and make it like it should be.....very thankful i have my video tapes/VHS of recording it when it was on repeats."
3391,3,"This was a groundbreaking show of the 1990's. And as one of the best shows, the episodes should remain INTACT! MOST of the original music soundtrack from the shows as well as whole scenes have been replaced and removed, i.e. popular bands and songs from the period, which, in my, and many others opinion have utterly ruined this release. For a show that PUT FOX ON THE MAP it deserves much better. Hey CBS, pay the sync fees for the original music and release all 10 seasons properly. This is totally unacceptable. It would be like putting out Miami Vice without Phil Collins music. In these types of shows the music is so integral to the stories and the subtext. To replace it with generic garbage music does it a total disservice. Very disappointed."
3392,2,"I really wanted to like this show and there were some good elements, but overall, it must didn't measure up and I can't recommend it. While the cinematography and costuming were very good, the dialogue and acting were very bad. The characters were very one dimensional and story lines predictable. The whole series just didn't seem to come together and the dialogue bounced from being laughable to just plain painful. I forced myself to watch the entire series, but I definitely will not be viewing the second. It's really too bad because there is a lot of potential here. I did like the opening music."
3393,2,"I had a difficult time finding an interesting theme in viewing the first six episodes of Season 1, where I gave up. More than anything else, there seemed to be an effort to show that pagan worship was little different than if not superior to Christianity.The Ragnar character seemed neither attractive or praiseworthy. In fact, no one emerged as a captivating character.I could not get the feeling that the details of life or worship or customs were anything but someone's supposition. And lastly, the violence seemed a substitute for good drama. I finally concluded I could find some good British dramas or mysteries that would be more interesting than this failure."
3394,2,"Show is great, but it's the censored version on Amazon Prime.Most episodes are 4-6min shorter because of all the censoring. Not sure why they would, but it's pretty lame to do so and not make it clearly stated. This show deserves to be seen as the creators intended it, I will get the the rest of the seasons elsewhere."
3395,1,"Terrible show. I initially couldn't get thru first episode and stopped watching. I gave it a second try and watched thru the seventh episode. As it goes on, it just gets worse. Lead actor is worst of all, but there all pretty bad. Ridiculous story lines and lack of authenticity. Dumbed down for shallow audience seeking blood and guts with no substance. Game of Thrones, its not!"
3396,2,"It starts out with graphic fighting and then follows it up with rape. I didn't get past the first 10 minutes and won't watch any more either. I realize that it is trying to be like those HBO shows like Rome, but too much for my stomach to handle. I was supposed to start caring for these main characters, but it was impossible to even get a sense of who they were before all the violence. Why would I care about them? I guess in the end, I won't. No desire to see that."
3397,3,just not very interesting from either the standpoint of characters or plot. There were a couple of scenes that held interest but overall it was just either boring or unintelligible for the dialogue to be 100% IT computer programming lingo. The main character is not very appealing either physically or otherwise which makes it difficult to want to get involved with the series.
3398,3,"I really wanted to like this, but I only made it thru five episodes. The main character's drug usage is gratuitous and unrelatable, distracting from the plot. As well as the internal dialogue that drones on and on without adding anything compelling to his character.Also, what's up with the Dark Chinese connection? We have no idea why they are necessary or what it means to lose them. Make me care about something before you take it away."
3399,3,"The first episode captured my attention and the second one hooked me. Then I watched episodes 3-5 back-to-back and the extent to which the writers chose to develope the dark, depraved, seedy side of humanity completely turned me off. For me, the intellectual cyber possibilities completely gave way too another platform showing the darkest side of humanity which I suspect will appeal to the reality show dependent masses."
3400,1,"I tried to watch this show, it seemed interesting but after two episodes I just couldn't do it anymore. It just feels like a bunch of potheads trying to act smart, the acting for me was terrible, the only thing I found somewhat interesting at first was the plot line but even that began to feel lame by episode two. Feels like it will just mostly be sex and drugs with a weak minded character.They got quite a bit of reference wrong as well, which for me is a petpeeve, they should have done their homework before shooting. This was a complete waste of my time."
3401,3,"I bought these because I bought the Wild Unknown Animal deck and absolutely loved the quality and artwork and thought put into it. The artwork and thought behind here in these cards is just as beautiful, and I hate to leave a 1 star review, but the quality of this cardstock compared to my other Wild Unknown deck is HORRIBLE. Many of the cards have bends and creases in them and are unusable. It is so thin. Attempting to return. I'm really sad and disappointed by this. I would have paid more if I were to receive a better quality deck. :-(."
3402,1,"The cards are beautiful, but the guidebook is inadequate, a brief paragraph on each card. Nothing in depth. And many of the interpretations contradict, or have nothing at all to do with, the time-tested interpretations of more traditional decks. If you are the sort of reader who interprets the cards through your own internal intuition, then this would be a beautiful deck to use. If you are looking to the author for in-depth interpretation, look elsewhere."
3403,3,"The artwork is beautiful, and I really appreciate all that the artist did to create this deck.However, the quality of the cards is so very cheap. They were impossible to shuffle, all the cards ""clump"" together and would not shuffle at all. A few cards also had scratches on the surface. Very disappointed."
3404,2,"Do not purchase this deck if you are a lightworker. This deck has very negative vibes attached to it. Even the most postive cards have a very eerie attachment to them. Did one reading for a client and she broke down in tears. After speaking with her about the situation and doing a reading it made everything much worse for her. Not helpful at all. My intuition led me in a different direction than the cards were showing. Did multiple readings for myself and the negativity was still there. Very upset with the descriptions of each card very vague and extremely negative. I actually contemplated burning them, due to the dark nature of the deck. I would give this deck no stars if I could. Such a shame because I really enjoyed her unknown animal deck. Will be returning them asap."
3405,1,"This deck contains a very real negative vibe, the cards are dreary and dark. The meanings cannot be intuited by the imagery, in most cases there really is nothing to hone in visually and where there is an image, it makes no sense with the correlating description in the book or with traditional meaning. It also seems that the author did not do extensive research in Tarot tradition, imagery, meanings and uses. Some of my favorite Tarot decks to work with are untraditional decks, this deck is not one of them. The Wild Unknown Tarot appears to be a vanity deck devoid of substance. Although nicely packaged the cards are poor quality and get stuck to each other when fanning them out. Don't waste your money on this poorly designed deck. The negative feelings you will get from doing a reading cannot be underestimated. There are many other wonderful non traditional decks out there, Stay away from this one."
3406,1,"The two decks I received were poor quality copies. How do I know? I ordered from the same company that makes these cruddy things. I thought here was more legit. Yes, legal decksdo not come without the small booklet and especially do not come with blank cards. My legit deck came with the copyright on the box, the booklet, and better quality deck overall. Do not buy these cheap knockoffs."
3407,3,"I bought this deck, hoping that the reviews stating that it was less quality than previous editions. It is true. I have a 6+ year old deck that I was using and bent up pretty well, so I wanted to replace it with a new, fresh deck. The new deck feels much thinner, and is missing the glossy finish the older one had. Now it's matte.A matte finish will not last as long. Truly disappointing, this is the worlds most famous deck, it deserves the premium treatment. Perhaps the company wants to promote other decks in its place?"
3408,1,Be forewarned. I am a professional reader and have used this deck for years. My decks wear out often and I have to replace them. I just opened a new deck (april 2016) and along with the new low price the quality is also low and awful. The cards are no longer glossy and much thinner than thy have ever been before. I am so upset. I don't know where I will be able to find the previous edition with more durable and glossier cards :(.
3409,1,"I've been dabbling around with the tarot for about 30 years. Had several standard Rider-Waite decks during that time..they are basically the go-to for learning tarot. Whether you continue to read with them after learning is personal choice, but the standard Rider-Waite is the best tool with which to learn. My old decks were in storage and disappeared, so I needed new ones when I got this most recent urge to take up tarot again.Generally speaking the coloring on the standard Rider-Waite from U.S. Games has always been a bit garish, but not offensively so, and you get used to it. You might even come to prefer it (I did), which is why I decided to buy this deck.Stupidly, I did not heed the warnings of the other one-star reviews with regards to the coloration of the current printing of the standard Rider Waite. This edition or whatever you want to call it is really, truly, fantastically horrible. The blues are particularly, offensively bright, distracting, and artificial. These cards are so ugly and weird-looking I can't even begin to contemplate trying to work with them. The woman in the Star trump looks like the old timey wrestler Dusty Rhodes, with his albino-blonde hair and orange spray tan. Just Plain Wrong.When I opened the shipping box the outer box the cards came in had no plastic on it, and had obviously already been opened, although the cards inside were shrink-wrapped in plastic. And to be clear, I did have to take the plastic off the actual deck to get to the true weirdness and ugliness inside, because the top card that shows through the deck shrink-wrap (The Magician) has only very little blue in it and none of the other truly odd coloring. That card (and that card alone) is relatively normal-looking. So when I took the deck out of the box, before opening the shrink-wrap and looking at the other cards, I assumed I'd gotten a satisfactory deck and the one-star reviews were probably aberrations. Not so!Bottom line: do yourself a favor and don't buy these, unless you want to pay five bucks return shipping for the privilege of abusing your retinas.A good alternative is the regular size Smith-Waite Centennial deck, although the coloring isn't as clear for beginners. Watch out for size, though...the Centennials that come in a tin are the same size as playing cards, so if you want a bigger ""standard size"" tarot deck get the Centennial without a tin.Another good learning tool is the Giant Rider-Waite. They're very big, almost too big to work with, but they're fun and good for studying the cards. I also rebought a jumbo deck and the coloring on those is fine. The good old standard.Whatever alternative you choose, just please do yourself a favor and stay away from these! I wish I'd heeded those other one-star reviews. Now I'm out five buck for return shipping. And maybe some eyedrops for retina abrasion."
3410,1,"The quality of this deck is not on par with the other two decks that I own. This deck feels and looks very flimsy. The cards are paper thin, the images are washed out and lack detail. My previous Rider deck was so much better, much thicker cards, way way more animated realistic print. Too bad I misplaced it and don't remeber where I bought it from. So far I dont have any desire to even hold that new deck. May return it, but it's just too much hassle. So it just sits there. Needless to say, I do NOT recommend this product."
3411,3,"Kind of cheesy, self promoting writing style, but if you can get past that, there are many useful exercises. This isnt my favorite book; I learned just as much from the exercises in Joan Bunning's book, which is written for beginners. Having said that, it is useful to read many perspectives, even ones you dont love, to develop the best way to access the tarot symbology for yourself."
3412,3,"While the spirit of this book is good, and some of the techniques given are useful, I found some things about it somewhat off-putting.For one thing, the style and language used in this book is a bit juvenile (with terms like ""willy-nilly"" or ""Lemme 'splain"" used periodically). Also, I found the examples of card interpretation in some scenarios to be off base. Finally, a Celtic cross layout is defined that does not match the traditional ordering. Top it off with a lot of advertising for a web site and the feeling of it being a course workbook written by a professor who ""can't do, so s/he teaches instead"" completes the let down feeling I received from this purchase.All of these things can be written off to the authors personal relationship with the tarot I suppose, however they seem to speak with a kind of general authority on the subject that was surprising to see, given some of the unusual card interpretations and non-standard spread ordering that should at least come with a caveat of ""this is what works for me, but is not the 'traditional' way""."
3413,3,"I received the book with high expectations last year and despite my eagerness to read it all at once, I stepped back, took a deep breath and spent all those months reading it carefully page by page, while testing what is being suggested inside with the help of 2 very good friends who also own the book and are professional psychic readers.
First Glance:
-I have to admit that the cover design is one of the most successful ones in the market. The simplicity of the black color and the beige logotype of the initials “ATS” make the book easily recognizable anywhere on the shelves of a bookstore.
-The layout of the content is also very well-presented. The book is divided in 5 basic parts plus the Appendices at the last part of the book.
1)New Exercises. This is the first section of the book that introduces a variety of exercises for tarot students. Each exercise consists of the following sub-heads: “Name of the exercise, Why is this important?, How to do it, Examples, Practice, Self-testing, Lesson Summary, Also see..”.
2)New Games. The second section follows a similar format as described above : “Title, Why is this important? Basics of the game, How to play, Tips, Lesson Summary.
I decided to include both sections as one “big chapter” in my review because they are so similar to each other and my remarks apply invariably.
The biggest turn-off I had was that 90% of the games and exercises were already introduced with a different “title” or “format” in the author’s previous book “The Easiest Way to Learn the Tarot-EVER!!!” (the author himself quotes pages and exercises over and over again from his previous book). By default, this already makes the majority of the content extremely basic.
Moreover, most exercises and games promote certain habits that I do not appreciate in card-reading such as chaotic brainstorming and combining random cards together in an inconsistent manner (i.e. free association).
To support this, I will quote a few words by the author:
p.3 “3 of cups-sidekick card, with 5 of wands-dominant: I am a male stripper”.
p.4 “There are no set formulas you can follow”
p.2 “Blend the two cards together to form hypothetical meanings”.
Hypothetical meanings cannot save the professional reader during a real-life session with a paying client. Unfortunately, intuition cannot be at its peak every single day and readers need formulas to back up their practice and professionalism.
However, there are very few exercises (3) that might help the complete amateur. One of them is the “Noun, Verb, Adjective” p.9-22, in which a big list of “potential connotations” is given and the student needs to review the deck and correlate the meanings with the cards.
That could also be applied not only in Tarot but other decks as well and could be valuable when one would like to expand their vocabulary in readings and/or simply review the definitions.
For me there was nothing new in the first 80 pages of the book. Even the so-called “Diana’s exercise” which was influenced by Russian esoteric forums was not something innovative for me, as I have already practiced these type of inquiries while in Russia a few years ago.
3 + 4) Advanced Spread Basics + Spread Techniques.
This “big chapter” starts with a very interesting statement by the author: “I firmly believe his (Waite’s) version of the Celtic Cross spread, like his vision of the Tarot, is deeply flawed”. And I found myself contemplating on the idea, whether this book was written by the same or different authors.
First of all because of the aforementioned statement, which is contradictory to “Art makes the Tarot”, p.71 (since Waite’s tarot is flawed, so is the art in the cards, which consequently makes the “face value” approach of meanings-that relies explicitly on the art-inaccurate).
Secondly, because during the exercises part of the book, the author promotes the “random one-two-three card spreads”(also called “blob spreads” in the book) as a very good way to develop intuition and reading skills, but suddenly on page 83 we read: “you should avoid blob spreads whenever possible.” And further “ …You have less information to work with. This means your answer will be more vague and make the client end up filling in the details themselves. This is unacceptable.”
And there are more contradictions to all the above:
p.92 “The Tarot is the best tool to date for developing your intuition..”
p.95 “Your answer will almost always be general and vague. That’s okay at this point..”
etc.
One thing that was ethically unacceptable is written on page 101 “After relaxing her (the client), and yourself, you chat with her a bit and get some background information..”.
Supposedly, this is what psychic readers are paid for. No client is obliged to tell anything to the reader except the minimum basics: “A name and a specific question, if any”. The reader must reveal any background info in order to build a strong bridge between the two parties.
In general, I have to say that this section could have been rather interesting if it was truly written for advanced students-readers. Unfortunately, the reader strictly gives only 6 pages on how to break down a Celtic Cross with its “basic mini-spreads”. The modification of the spreads, plus the “verification” process, clarification cards falls into the category “cartomancy 101”. The most disappointing part is that there is no actual demonstration with real case studies.
However, I have to admit that if one wants to master the Celtic Cross, Dusty’s version is a really interesting one to study.
Though, unfortunately as a spread, the Celtic Cross cannot serve 15-minute readings either face-to-face or by phone. But that is another story and it has nothing to do with the book.
5)Fun Things
In this last section, the author provides suggestion on other applications one can experiment with using the Tarot. For example, dowsing, manifestation, designing your own spread/deck, brainstorming, problem solving etc.
Unfortunately, in most cases, there is not even a specific demonstration included, apart from vague suggestions like :
p. 129 “know your spreads…shuffling, asking, and drawing cards as needed until you get a solid “hit”.”
The only practical example is provided on pages 147-155, where the author explains a specific case in detail with regards to the roundabout spread (you should check his first book for more information on this spread per se).
Additionally, he introduces in a very simple and understandable language the idea of planetary associations (e.g. polarities etc) in the roundabout spread, which is basically the astrological wheel layout.
This is indeed the only “advanced” topic I read in the book, because astrology is not a field that everyone can comprehend easily, especially when they are not familiar with the subject. But I have to admit that Dusty succeeds in explaining the basics for his “style of reading”.
The book ends up with a few pages, called “Appendices” with relative references to other sources and a few more info.
On a final note, I expected a lot more from a book called “Advanced Tarot Secrets”. I was rather disappointed as there is a lot of data missing from such a manual. To name a few: how to approach specific inquiries with clear examples, and showcase with real case studies how to modify a spread, specific and advanced meanings for all cards that can be applied to intricate inquiries (e.g. business and investments, sexuality and relationships, etc.), as well as how and which ones to use as significators for most basic questions. Of course, I understand that it is not possible to say all in a single volume, but a lot of things could have been introduced for the advanced students.
Final verdict: I liked the author, not the work.."
3414,1,"Didn't like the book or the author's method of writing. I would give this book a -5 stars if possible. The author states a lot of opinions and doesn't really provide supportive facts. His writing tone makes him sound like an obnoxious A$$hole. I should have returned it, but it ended up in the trash.I like the Tarot books by Janina Renee so much better."
3415,3,"Ugh. Not what I expected.I get the different ways to look at the cards .... but aside all that, I was expecting Dusty go a bit deeper into the meaning of each card (not necessarily give ""key phrases"", but really explore the cards like he does on his videos.So unfortunately, I'm disappointed."
3416,3,"Tarot deck cards usually have enough imagery and visuals so you know what the card means just by looking at it. The visuals are supposed to touch you mentally, spiritually and in all the ways that will help you give proper readings using your perceptive senses. The cards, visually, are very bland. The most expressive card in the deck seems to be the Joker. This is the card I saw when I decided to purchase the deck. I don't like the deck at all. Sorry for the bad review."
3417,1,I have several other tarot card decks and thought this one would be a nice addition however. I'm not a fan of them at all. All of the swords are extremely dramatic and could scare people who are receiving a reading and don't know how to read the cards. I wouldn't recommend this deck for a beginner. The cards also have a melancholy vibe about them. It kind makes the readings feel somber even if there is good news. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase them.
3418,3,"The art is beautiful and I was really excited about this deck, but the Strength card is... well, it's unsettling. It's possibly just me, but a smiling white blonde lady straddling the massively oversized head of a painted POC face is... just squicky.Between that and the King of Coins I just tossed the whole deck. Which is a shame, because the silver gliding and a lot of the other cards were nice, but once it hits that This Is Uncomfortable chord, it's done."
3419,2,"I don’t mind the illustrations and card stock (thick), but what I don’t like is that the cards stick together quite a bit and it’s not the easiest to shuffle. They clump together into groups and don’t shuffle well like the Sexual Tarot or the Waite cards do. I couldn’t return it on time so I’ll have to keep it, but I do NOT use these at all."
3420,1,"I'm very disappointed with this Deck, although the art is beautiful the materials used are of very poor quality.Not only the cards feel very thin and coarse they came bent! Inside the plastic wrap. That was enough to bend the cards inside.The silver outline just brushed out of the cards when I touched it.It's incredible that a product comes damaged right out of the package. Really poor materials, it's not worth the price."
3421,3,"I am not happy at all with this deck. They are totally different now. I don't know why the cards are not laminated anymore. This is my third set of the universal Waite tarot deck. This first time was years ago and they were very pretty. The colors stood out and they were laminated. I ordered again this year, but from Amazon. Those cards were just like the deck I got today just ugly. They are so thin and rough. I absolutely hate what I got."
3422,1,"Either these have been seriously downgraded or they they are counterfeit. I’ve had two previous versions of this deck by the same maker and they were nothing like this. I’ve ordered cards off amazon in the past and they were always knock offs and had to be returned. These are smaller than the original deck, they are weirdly glossy almost plastic feeling and terrible print quality. This is the last deck I’ll buy off amazon. I suggest going to your local shop and buying from a reputable dealer."
3423,3,"Just received the standardsized Universal Waite (Isbn 1572815612, blue box with a spreadsheet). Compared to the beautiful pocketversion the printing is a catastrophy. The vibrant colours are gone, fx the Hermit is no longer standing in the dark of night but in the early gloom of the morning. Now I don't mind a certain paleness. But please, there is absolutely no focus whatsoever in the cards. It looks like a really bad scan to me, with all details gone. Even the copyright (2004) is blurred! Did I get a bad copy or is this the standard of the US games printing?"
3424,2,"I have purchased 2 decks by this company now. The first is the Crystal Visions Tarot, that was a few weeks ago, and now this deck. Both decks have been a huge disappointment. These cards are shedding paper bits like nobody's business. It is so bad that it leave a film on the deck and on your hands when you handle them. It is hard to see, but you feel it, and it feels like that layer of ink and paper bits you get on your fingers when you read a newspaper. I literally have to wash my hands every time I touch these decks. I am so disappointed. The first deck I just thought was a fluke and maybe I got a bad batch. However, getting this deck and being confronted with the same problem with a completely different deck than the first one shows me that this is not a one time thing, and it is not a deck issue. It is a company issue. I have returned this deck and I will never be purchasing from this company again."
3425,1,"They feel very cheap and had a funny smell when I received them. The box looked worn out and the images are faded. HORRIBLE QUALITY update: NOW THAT I WENT THROUGH THEM, THE BACK OF THEM ARE FADED. ONE HAS A WEIRD GLOSS? Like someone painted over the back and they're supposed to be brand new!! IM SO DISAPPOINTED I hope I can return them. I should've not felt bad about shelling out the full 22$ original Rider Waite. I don't know if I'm the only one that got a horrible deck like this because I trusted the review's but if I can get a new set that or a refund it would be greatly appreciated because I feel like I wasted 18$. They feel like they all have dust on them or some type of dirt and leave your hands feeling grimy and gross."
3426,2,"I along with other Tarot students purchased this book and eagerly anticipated receiving it. What a disappointment!!! I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviews about the grey print. Tell me, who prints a book in grey ink? Also, the top edge of the book has this uneven ink edge that gives it the effect of ink being spilled at the top. Supposedly it was a design. Sorry, but it's just plain STUPID!!! I worked in the printing business for a short time and I never encountered anything like this. The pictures of the cards are also blurry and difficult to distinguish the various symbols. I sent an email to Brigit Esselmont via her website to complain about the absolutely poor quality of the book. She did respond via a video apology saying that she was sorry, but it was all Amazon's fault. I think that is very disingenuous and misleading. I know for a fact that publishers send proofs to the book's author to be looked at and authorized. My personal opinion is that Esselmont or whoever she chose to oversee the publishing either didn't really look at the proofs or just didn't care. I think they just approved it in order to meet a deadline and just chose to publish it with all it's faults. This is really the worst print job I have ever seen. I decided to return the book and receive a refund rather than re-order. I will purchase another Tarot book by a different author that is more legible and of a much higher quality."
3427,3,"Let me be straight forward: the content is great... BUT the book is really, really hard to read. It looks like a copy of a book. As a designer, I can see that it was a design flaw combined with a poor print quality. The designer used a sans serif light font, which by itself would be more problematic to read in a printed book size. Add to it, a printer with low quality ink and you will have this book. Maybe it was a matter of using the same design of the ebook. I haven't seen the ebook, I am just guessing. If so, then this was the mistake. This book NEEDS URGENTLY to be redesigned for print and then reprinted. I am sending mine back to Amazon, hoping I will get a better/darker one as replacement. If not, I will ask for a refund."
3428,3,I was disappointed in the book as the print was very light and hard to read and pictures were in black and white instead of colour as was the description of book. I returned it ok with only to receive the same copy back. I tried to contact author and said it only ;depends on where amazon got the book from. It cost me over $170.00 to return and final cost if I was to return it again allowing for au to us $. ie $43.00 au to send the book back. I have contacted Amazon only to say thanks for the feed back. I was asking for another book ie the third book but I cannot afford another $43.00 to return it and maybe only receive the same book again. NOt happy and was hoping for the book to be sent as I requested in the first place at no charge.
3429,2,"I actually cancelled my pre-order right before the book shipped after reading some comments and looking at pictures of the quality of this book. I was super excited to have this book and waited for weeks to have it! But I was so disappointed that I wasn't going to get my moneys worth. A $40 tarot book that has no color? Not being able to even read it because of poor font and and print? Thin, crappy paper? Causing people headaches? I've never heard those problems about a book before! I'm just not willing to risk the hassle of returning it and having it be way below my expectations. There's better resources out there for me."
3430,1,"Sadness, Disappointment, Deception... This is the first time I have reviewed a book in my 15+ years of buying books from Amazon and I am very upset. The book is dull, very, very dull. So dull that some of the pages seem to have been printed in draft mode in a cheap printer. Just look at the photos I have included in this review. Additionally, it came with a teared page and the book suffers from poor editing (page 437) a header is in one page while its content is in the next page. The font selection for this book was terrible because the font is very thin so, adding the problem of poor printing, I have to read the book 3 inches from my face!! Otherwise, it is just a big gray blur at normal reading distance.Regarding the content, I appreciate that the author added an interpretation for each card from the different questions a client may ask in a reading i.e. career, work, health and adds personality types and suggested cards interpretations but, there are many free websites that offer the same or better information and in a ""legible"" manner.Don't get me wrong, I was expecting to have this book in my hands the minute it appeared on Amazon given the impression I had from the author's website which is aesthetically very nice as well as the information it provides.But, the book is the INVERTED meaning of the Website.Dusty White's Tarot books are the best. Do not spend money and time in this book!"
3431,3,"I was so excited to receive this deck after pre-ordering it back in early June. It was frustrating to hear from friends who just ordered it this week on a whim that they received theirs before me but I finally got mine today.What a strange disappointment. While the art of Ravynne is undeniably beautiful, the production quality is inexplicably poor. And I mean that literally - I can't explain some of these issues logically:1. I opened the shrink wrapped sturdy outer box to find the inner box corners mysteriously ripped/crushed and all of the card corners bent.2. The card stock is VERY thin (I don't know what kind of decks these other reviewers are used to using but these would NOT hold up very long to regular readings). This would explain not only the bent corners in the cutting process but also some cards having creases in them toward the top - probably indentations from misaligned cards in the production process (yes, that's how thin the card stock is).3. The lack of any design on the back, other than a thin yellow line, makes the completely misaligned trimming job all the more obvious. The margins on one side are much bigger than the other on quite a number of the cards.4. There are also some cards that have a weird problem with the black finish that makes them appear to have grey spots and you can also feel rough patches on some of the cards amidst the ostensibly completely slick finish on both sides.5. Most perplexing of all is that a handful of cards *in the middle of the deck* had really bad water damage along the bottom (some, all the way up through the very large titles)! I have no earthly idea how this could happen prior to packaging/quality control.I know Blue Angel Publishing usually has good quality decks with very different card stock, but they've obviously used a different printer this time and it's really bad.It's also a shame because this is a lovely deck and I know that Ravynne Phelan has been working on this project for many years to bring it to fruition :(...5 stars for Ravynne's art, 0 stars for the production quality."
3432,3,"While the artwork is amazing, I agree with another reviewer that the card descriptions (which are necessary) are highly sexist. Also, I don't need a deck telling me to ""do onto others as you would have them do onto you"" and ""have faith that everything happens for a reason"". I think it's a shame all that beautiful artwork was wasted on the equivalent of Sunday school lessons."
3433,3,"There are pros and cons to this deck and I'm going to start out with the negatives.- The cardstock and ultra gloss finish are awful. The cards feel cheap and almost repulsive. They also don't fit right in my hands, being wider than most decks, which makes them unwieldy. The cards came new but with chipped white corners on many of them, leaving me to believe that there's a white layer under the black.- The artist/author has some extremely dated and at some points offensive beliefs that she attempts to hammer home far too frequently. (See photos.) For a deck made for ""a new era"", she sure relies heavily on rhetoric dating back quite a ways. Examples: on multiple pages (and I'm less than halfway through the guidebook right now) she states ""there is only one race, the human race"". This alone is totally cringe-worthy. Firstly because it's factually incorrect from a purely objective standpoint. Humans are a species, not a race. Secondly, this point of view encourages erasure of the perspectives of People of Color. PoC lack the privilege whiteness affords. They don't get to be ""colorblind"". They see their skin tone reflected back at them in the expressions and mannerisms of everyone they encounter. They are acutely aware of being othered and denying that is an act of censure. Colorblindness doesn't erase racism, it erases the lived experiences of humans who don't get to play make-believe. Now, I know there is a school of thought dating back to the boomers in which colorblindness and this type of language are encouraged in an attempt to be more inclusive. Perhaps the author falls into this category of people. It is important to keep in mind that impact is greater than intent. ""The best of intentions"" and all that. It doesn't matter what she thinks she was trying to convey, what matters is whether or not she listens to people with valid complaints and whether or not she invites PoC to the proverbial table. Phrasing matters.- Another example of weirdness and possible delusional thinking is highlighted in the second two photos. She trash talks ""the media"" (which, to be fair, is too broad a term) and says this, ""in fact, much of [the media] is complete fabrication designed to influence you to believe what they tell you. A little bit of truth is hidden within the lies so that we will focus upon that thread of truth..."" This is a very skewed statement and does a disservice to journalists and actual news publications. She is right about one thing, though; there is a kernel of truth in that lie. A lot of media providers seek ratings and profits. To achieve these, they sensationalize a lot. They want to hook people with headlines. Even local news channels are utilizing clickbait tactics now and some national news organizations pander to their audience. That does not mean it's all a lie or that there is this giant ""sheep"" conspiracy (the belief that the government is out to get you and wants to turn the people into sheep to keep them under control).Positives:- The imagery is gorgeous. She is a skilled artist.Something about this deck just makes it the hardest of mine to read, so I'm going card by card through the guidebook. It's not resonating with me as well as I'd like and the deviation from the traditional RWS format makes it quite challenging for a Tarot beginner.I wanted to like this deck, I really did, but it's so hard to connect with it when the artist and author have such limited beliefs combined with the inferior print quality. At this price point, I expected more. I get a lot more enjoyment out of my indie Luna Sol deck and even my Llewellyn Shadowscapes one. I feel like flipping through these and reading the book is a chore I won't quit, because I spent money on this. The guidebook is almost too big, too. It's physically short enough to fit in a velour tarot bag of it's own, but it's so verbose. That's good and bad, but for someone who's just trying to trudge through it (""uphill and in the snow!"") it becomes very tedious.If I want to draw a card and get fuzzy feelings and immediately intuit the meanings, I choose the Luna Sol. If I want a challenge, I choose Shadowscapes. If I want a headache, I pull out the Dreams of Gaia. (Believe me, writing that makes me sad, too!)."
3434,3,I want to love this deck. The artwork is amazing and the guidebook is well written. The cards stock is horrible though. The cards stick and are so thin. After just a couple days of using them for personal readings the cards are already showing wear. I really wish they could be reprinted because like I said the artwork is amazing and I think I could really connect with the deck. Very disappointed!
3435,2,"First card I pulled was ""The Father"". The book reads (from memory, as I have since removed the deck from my home), ""The father is very much the centre core of power of the family."" Enough said, I am not interested in reading anything more by this ""author"".Additionally, not all the cards have titles on them, just an obscure image of a person usually, making it difficult to do any sort of quick or overview/pattern readings without referring to the sexist book."
3436,3,"The first thing I noticed when I opened this deck was that they came out of order, any Tarot deck I have bought ever has come in order , this deck started with 8 of Wands and went in no order, the cards looked like they had been shuffled already. They had Chinese writing on everything and all the cards, it did come in English but I didn't want to see the Chinese writing on my cards. The cool color was just OK. I do however like the smaller size of this deck and the quality of the cardstock was fine. I am returning the deck. I would of kept it if it weren't for the Chinese writing all over the cards."
3437,1,"You all. These are TERRIBLE. They are so small you can barely hold them. Cheap they were tearing and the edges were peeling. And even the cards themselves were faced all different directions, so they didn’t get taken care of even at the manufacture levels. Honestly beautiful graphics, but hard to see due to size and quality. I unfortunately don’t recommend these and my order is on its way back."
3438,1,I was excited to receive the deck. When I opened the box and looked at the cards. Disappointed they were a little narrow and thin. They feel cheep. I knew if I used them it be a very short matter of time they would be ragedy and worn. Decently NOT worth almost $15. They have a lot of nerve charging that price. Ha more like 6 7 or 8 dollers would be fitting. Greedy bastards now I have to mail them back go through all this rigamore for some darn tarot cards. But I want what I want and how I want it. Especially if I'm paying for it. Ok! Lol<U+0001F44E><U+0001F44E>.
3439,1,"I ordered this deck twice and returned it twice.Both times the were extra bits of paper to be cut from the edges.Both times there were scars and tears. Both times the cards came in complete disarray ... cards upright, cards reversed, cards face up, and face down.There was NO order to the cards. They had to be put in order to even know if all cards were present. And, nope! Both decks missing cards. The first deck received had 77 cards... no Star card. The second deck had 78 ... but two Hanged Man cards but no Lovers card.This is an open forum, so the best I can do is reduce all I have to say about these cards AND the manufacturer/packager/seller (most pointedly and directed to the manufacturer/packager/seller) is PATHETIC.Flimsy material. The sort you might expect from a Cracker Jack box. Quality of a novelty or gimmick at best. Not worthy of even a collector item that would sit dust collecting on a shelf.Let's all have a moment of silence for the trees we've lost who gave their lives in vain to be so horrifically subjugated to this sort of deplorable sub-human behavior."
3440,2,I’m missing a 9 of pentacles and king of pentacles I’m really disappointed and sad because you need all 78! I can’t do with 76 :( and plus it doesn’t tell me how to get a hold of the company to make a return I’d rather just not go through the trouble of exchanging for the fact that I’ve read reviews saying they still receive messed up decks and they have to buy 2 or 3 decks and swap out cards to perfect their 1.... :( im mean the deck beautiful and all but I don’t want 3! Or even 2.... maybe it’s my fault for buying a production set of tarot but hey they looked beautiful :) and don’t get me wrong they are beautiful the tint is a nice shiny raindbow effect very nice I like the dark back ground the and back of the cards are pretty as well I just wish they would have put all 78 cards that are supposed to be in there... it’s very disappointing Hopefully there’s a way to get the 2 cards sent.
3441,1,"I must completely agree with the reviewer who commented on the quality of the scans of this deck. In interest of full disclosure, am I not the world's biggest fan of this deck but that being said, US Games has done a terrible disservice to these keys. Although the image quality varies from card to card, the pixelation and fuzzy scans are just inexcusable as they greatly diminish from the art work of the cards themselves. If you really want this deck I would strongly suggest buying an older printing. It's a shame that a deck that has so much to offer would be subject to such poor production values."
3442,2,"The re-printing of this beautiful Tarot deck is utter rubbish. The amazingly intricate drawings of Godfrey Dowson have been blurred and pixilated to an embarrassing degree. Also, the cards themselves were cut irregularly, so no two cards were even uniformly shaped. Seriously, I could go down to Kinkos and make better replications of these cards! In this day and age of technology there is no excuse for blurry pixilation and irregularly cut cards. If you think that you are getting the inspiring original printing of these cards, you will be sadly mistaken.I've contacted U.S. Games Systems and they have ignored me. I tried to warn customers on their site but they didn't post my review. If I were to speculate, I would think that they are trying to retain the inflated value of the original printing by releasing a disgustingly low quality representation in their latest re-printing at the expense of you, the customer. Buyer beware.Update: I have posted two pictures which capture the quality issues I mention; one of the poorly clipped corner and one of flagrant pixelation. Please note that this pixelation is not due to my scanner but is an exact replica of the shoddy quality. In the original printing, these lines were razor sharp and clean. They are now a blurry mess. If someone could post a similar picture of VIII, Fortitude, I would be grateful, just to make sure I didn't get a shoddy deck."
3443,2,"I was really excited when I found this deck on-line. I had the original printing from the 80's and had given it to a friend never to be seen again. The images are fantastic and filled with symbolism. However, this edition was so poorly executed I actually gave the cards away after I received them. The printing was so off on the images it almost looked like the images were out of focus some cards were worse than others but the pixelation was too much for me...Then again the price of the cards was not high. So if you had the original and get this one I feel you may be unsatisfied. If you never had them and want a copy go for it for the price. I'm going to try and find a used copy on line they are not cheap for the original."
3444,3,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here. Many of the card images are pixelated.I bought a tarot deck both for research and use purposes and I chose this one because it seemed highly recognized and regarded -- and, from the samples, I thought the pictures were wonderful.However, not all the cards have the same quality art as others. I am not sure why that is. I am not talking about pixelation here I am talking about the actual drawings. Some are excellent, while some look very sloppily drawn. Not sure if Godfrey Dowson got tired after a while or what.On top of that, at least two of the cards contain satanic symbols (inverted Pentagram and the head of a goat). Not comfortable with that sort of imagery of thing I use in a personal manner."
3445,3,"Overall a very crude and amateurish deck. If you are interested in hermetic Tarot, the Crowley-Harris deck is truly all you need. This deck, with its clumsy, off-kilter, amateurish art and complete lack of color (and yes, that is important when working with a Tarot deck) is not worth bothering with. There are any number of better Tarots that address hermetic material and concepts. I fail to see why this badly drawn, poorly drafted, confusing deck would attract anyone. The Crowley-Harris deck and the Cicero and Wang decks are still available, and are far superior to this colorless, crude mess."
3446,3,"I asked for this for Yule, based on the reviews. I have read tarot for years, and some cards, I know the meaning of right off the bat.....others, I don't. I wanted to have a way to get to know the cards and really know their meaning .This sounded like a great book.HOWEVER, the author has a lot of attitude. He's very much opposed to non-RWS decks. They seem to be an affront to him. This attitude comes through very plainly (My husband and I have a multitude of decks, and not a one is the RWS). Sure, he recommends a few non-RWS decks, but the decks he recommends are very faithful to the RWS. So, starting on page 1 the man annoyed me.""The Halloween Tarot is one of the few rare exceptions to the (general) rule that any modern Tarot deck will usually sacrifice a lot of traditional interpretation or divinitory detail for artistic license""""Decks such as the Antichi Tarocchi Bolognesi, the Lombardy, or any of the Marseilles variations are, of course, 'historically older' and therefore, fundamentally 'more correct' (if you are into the whole fundamentalist movement thing), but in reality they leave a lot to be desired. They are fun to own and show off at parties, but when you need a quick and dirty reading on the local gossip, you will more likely find yourself grabbing one of the Waite decks.""Now, I'm not a Marseilles reader -- but that doesn't meant that there are not people for whom this is the preferred. I also don't personally care for pip decks.I was already on edge with this man before I finished page one. These are both from that page.Then I got to page 16 when he says this: ""A quick note on 'Pentacles.' No matter what your deck calls them, see them as gold coins not religious or magical symbols. The seditious act of changing coins into pentacles in the circles of the suit of Coins was a whim of an artist long ago that detracts from the meaning of the suit, which is 'money.' Instead they look like wooden pagan symbols painted yellow, which makes the interpretations needlessly confusing and counterintuitive. Adding 'stars' to the suit of Coins has served no purpose except to confuse and intimidate the public, and of course to enrage conservative Christian sects in the twentieth century (which is always fun).""By the time I was done with this page, I was done with Dusty. Looking forward to taking this to 2nd and Charles and at least getting some return from it.Pick up Liz Dean's ""The Ultimate Guide to Tarot"" and leave this one here. "

3448,1,"Trying to learning the Tarot from this book is kind of like trying to lose weight by eating anything you want to eat. I have a few books on Tarot, and unfortunately, in my opinion, this is one was a waste of money. I found it pretty much useless. If you ONLY want to make up your own meanings for the cards, fine, you might like this book. If you really are interested in the traditionally-associated meanings for the cards as a jumping off point to your own intuitive readings, buy a couple of different books to get a couple different takes on each card."
3449,3,"Although the Amazon search category was: ""Tarot Cards and book sets"" and the second sentence of the review stated ""you start hands on learning immediately playing with your cards - I found after opening my package that cards are not included.Here in Las Vegas I had gone to two metaphysical stores, Barnes and Noble, Toys r Us and Walmart unable to find cards.After reading the above two inferences r/t cards I was not happy to now have go back online to get the cards :(."
3450,1,"I think the book should have been titled ""Easiest Book To Write EVER!"". A rewriting of the standard meanings to avoid plagiarism. The remembering stuff is boring so ""Make it up as you go"", or ""look at the pretty pictures on the cards"", style of learning. The book title implies a formula to learn the meanings of the Tarot and it fails with epic proportions. Looking at the Authors (and I use this term lightly) other literary offerings I get the distinct impression he has made a conscious decision to make another cash in style book. I am looking forward to his next work. ""How To learn Quantum Physics Whilst In The Bar Hitting on Gemini Women EVER!"" Available not in the usual one volume but in 12. The Author has no respect for Tarot and it's History, but more importantly here he has zero respect for the paying customer. EVER!As for the other gushing reviews they are either stooges or ...... EVER!"
3451,3,2 Major Arcana cards ripped/separated on the card backs the FIRST time I shuffled. Very lousy materials and got nowhere and no response when emailing Lo Scarabeo. Unfortunately these were a gift for Christmas so I don't have many avenues to request replacements.
3452,2,"I absolutely love the design of these cards. The arwork is beautiful, and I can’t wait to start using them. However, the first set of cards I received included about 6 or 7 cards that’s were bent/messed up. I ordered a replacement, and they were delivered within 2 days. But be cautious about identions or bent cards if you do order them."
3453,3,"I hate to put a bad review on here, but I honestly don't know how to contact the seller. Its not an option and I really want to get their attention. Let me say that this is a BEAUTIFUL deck. I am in awe of the artwork. It's a fantastic deck. But my set came with two knight of cups and is missing the Paige of Cups. I am really hoping that they will see this review and send me the Paige of Cups. As long as you get the right cards, you will LOVE this deck and I encourage you to pick it up! It's a BEAUTIFUL deck. You won't be sorry. I really hope that the seller gets back with me. I hate to have a bad review up, but missing a card is a big deal here. Thank you!"
3454,3,"Really bad quality of cardstock and the guide book that doesn't fit the box. On card was torn.I don't understand how that could happen because everything was packed in polythene. I filmed the process of unpacking, so yes, it was turn. I knew that authore likes dark art sometimes even creepy. But I thought his ""dark vision"" will find great realization in Santa Muerte theme. I WAS WRONG. He created the world of skeletes and that is all. I don't see in this cards that energy of beautiful but durk culture of Santa Muerte. I am very disappointed. The one thing that was good is that i received it on post office quite fast.UD: I Have to say it's good in work with prediction."
3455,1,"Was looking forward to receiving these items, as I love reading Osho's works. Everything arrived, albeit a day late (which was no problem), and on the package was a sticker that said ""Cannot be return if opened"". No drama so far. Once I opened it, the included instruction manual (inside the box set) was in French. Great if you are French, can read French, live in France or requested it to be in French. I did none of these, so you can imagine the disappointment once opened. Cant be returned, and now cant be used, so much for a Christmas present to myself. THEREFORE, if you cannot read or understand French I suggest you DO NOT purchase this item. Happy Holidays!"
3456,3,"Osho advocated for the killing of babies born with disabilities and said that gay people aren't even human beings and should be segregated from wider society. He also said that they created AIDS by being ""perverted"". Not only that, but he used his huge following to collect an absurd amount of wealth, live lavishly, and continue to encourage his followers to live on very little while he himself never followed his own teachings. If you don't think that's relevant to you using the deck, that's fine, but it left me with so much distaste that I can't in good conscience continue to use cards created by such a bigot. I don't want his spiritual guidance in any way, shape, or form."
3457,1,"I ordered this set directly from amazon and no where on the product review does it disclose that this item is a French language edition.Great if you speak French, bad if you don't.The barcode part of the box mentions that this box is meant for distribution in Canada.I have not been able to use the cards/booklet as I have not opened and plan to return the item and have decided to simply purchase from a local retailer and pay the extra 10 dollars to ensure an English edition.Be very careful! I was really excited to get the cards and not happy that this was not included in any information when ordering the product."
3458,3,"I owned the Osho Zen tarot cards years ago and they were so beautifully illustrated. I loved looking at the artwork and the quality of the cards were excellent.I was so disappointed to receive this becayse first of all, due to my mistake, I thought these were the cards and I was looking to replace my old deck. This was just a booklet and terribly made at that. Simple black/white newsprint and not visually appealing at all."
3459,3,"Reviews said how easy this deck was to read. I found it to be the opposite! It is confusing and the book's description for each card doesn't seem to go with the cards image. Albeit, I did not read for each card, but I did for many of them, and found them to be unenlightened and puzzling! The cards are pretty... but that's all this deck has going for it... in my opinion, of course!"
3460,1,"This app is actually pretty great. Enough that I sprung for the pro version, which was even better. I don't believe that Tarot cards can predict the future or tell you what other people are thinking or doing. I was looking for a way to process my own feelings about a lot of recent changes in my life, and a friend suggested I try Tarot. It is helpful lens for clarifying my own stuff. I paid for the.pro version because it allows you to save readings and make nores about them. It turned into a kind of journal for me; here's how the symbolism of the King of wands is helping me support my Dad through cancer, here's a card reminding me to delegate more at work, etc..A couple months later, the app up and stopped working. I would choose a spread, it would start to load and then kick me back to the homepage instead. There's no user support or trouble shooting guide in the app. So I decided to remove it from my device and then reinstall. I removed it from my device, but it then disappeared entirely from my cloud, taking a few months of journals with it. I re-downloaded what should have been pro and has some of the same increased functionalities, but all my saved data is gone and when I tried to review the pro version, I was told that I would need to buy it again. Long story short, this app is fantastic as long as you don't care about saving any data. Don't give them your money."
3461,3,It's annoying to know you have to buy a bigger program for this - and the readings it gives are so so but incomplete. The author(s) should have been up front about the fact that you would be downloading half a program and that IF you wanted more you will have to pay more. The cost is not significant but that had the author been more up front with the WHOLE package. There are 2 kinds of people who want Tarot - those that don't want to delve deeply into the origin and process and those that want a simplified version. Maybe it should have been been put out there in 2 versions and let the buyer decide if they want to learn more about the process of reading Tarot.
3462,1,"This app is actually pretty great. Enough that I sprung for the pro version, which was even better.

3463,3,Downloaded because I was curious to see what a tarot reading would say and compare it to my actual life. Just a fun mind experiment. What I got was a boring class on how to read tarot cards. Five minutes of that carp was enough for me.
3464,2,I have a love hate relationship with this app. I love to use it and hate the outcome. Why do I torture myself so!! It's really easy to get wrapped up in using this for every decision you have to make.. DON'T!! Sometimes I am not the smartest of people.. No matter how intelligent I am! I have deleted it. Simply because I WAS using it all.the.time. it was almost becoming a problem for me.....
3465,3,"I read the reviews of these but decided to go ahead and get them, especially as I'm travelling, but now I just wish I'd bought the normal sized deck. The artwork on these is beautiful and they'll be fine for learning the meanings but the card stock is SO thin, it feels thinner than a standard deck of bicycle cards so I feel like they won't hold up to use. They also have a tiny but very distracting copyright mark with the year and company on the face of each card in the white border. Wish I hadn't ordered these."
3466,3,"I will start off with the good: this is a gorgeous deck, and the artwork is exactly what I wanted. It is a thoughtful and gorgeous reproduction of a classic tarot design. The cardstock is good quality and very thick, and the tin to store the cards is a welcome and attractive accessory. Now the bad: as the description states (but only at the VERY END, and I unfortunately didn't see it) this is a very small ""pocket size"" deck. I was a little bemused when I opened my package and saw the tiny tin, but wasn't immediately discouraged. However once I opened them and held them in my hands and attempted to work with them, I was very disappointed. This is a 78-card deck that is very small and it is pretty much impossible to properly shuffle them. Since there's nothing actually WRONG with these and I cannot get a refund, I will be holding on to them (art project maybe?) but I will be buying this deck again in the standard 5"" version to actually practice with."
3467,3,"I was incredibly disappointed with these cards. They were small, probably the size of standard playing cards, and incredibly classy which made it hard for me to shuffle them. They're nice cards if you don't have a huge preference but if you're looking to make an attachment to your cards these might not be the ones for you, but they were new and in good condition, so probably okay for a beginner reader."
3468,3,"What is annoying about Amazon reviews is that often people comment on the wrong item. So let me be precise: this is the smaller deck that comes in a tin. Well, it was just so awful I returned it straight away. Unless you want these cards to put in a album or hang on a wall as display, they will fall apart in five minutes. I shuffled them only once and the top part started to come off the backing. I am incensed with US Games System for having their cards made in China now. ALL Chinese products are inferior quality and often even toxic. I got a friend to buy me the bigger version of this deck, still made in China, sadly, and still quite flimsy, but more resistent. I will only use them for back-up of my much older RWS deck which has been shuffled and used a million times and is still doing very well."
3469,3,"When I bought this, I presumed because it was a centennial edition in a tin it was a deluxe deck. Boy, was I wrong. This is the size of a small deck of playing cards and extremely flimsy stock. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because of the beautiful muted colors, but everything else about this deck is extremely disappointing."
3470,2,"When I opened the deck, the first thought was how thin the cards were, and that probably it won't become my favorite one. BUT when I looked through all of the cards I was amazed by the beautiful and unique artwork. Too sad that these cards probably won't last for long as they made from very thin carton paper. Would recommend any way as the artwork is great indeed."
3471,3,"I wanted to like these cards, but traded them immediately!Images did nothing for me. You know what I mean.Some decks speak and you listen......Others say nothing!"
3472,3,"I have the Cosmic Tarot Deck, which is why I purchased this book - to gain insight into the images in the deck. However, this book is lacking in everything one needs to determine the meanings of the cards or the images particular to this deck. I can't figure out why on earth this book is so expensive. If it's not lined in gold, there's just no reason to spend this kind of money on this overly simplistic paperback. I gave mine away to a thrift store because it was useless to me. Unless the seller of this book can give a good reason for charging $650, don't spend that kind of money for this book. For that price, you should get a lifetime of psychic readings to go along with the purchase."
3473,3,"The book isn't formatted for Kindle, nor does it have an index. It's impossible to look up anything directly. You'd have to scroll through all the pages.The cards themselves are based on the Rider Waite but have significantly different images and meanings --particularly in the minor arcana -- which opens up many more interpretive possibilities, especially for relationship readings. Once you become familiar with the next, it's possible to choose this for specific readings or specific people who might be able to handle the more negative slant of some cards."
3474,3,"I have several decks. My favorite is the Thoth because it feels the most complete in terms of symbols and astrology. And the artwork is fantastic. I tried the cosmic because a friend has it and loves it. I Gave it a go, and no way. The images do not inspire me at all. They are so cheesy. Make sure you look at all the cards and see if they resonate."
3475,1,"The card stock is horrible! It's flimsy, thin paper. Definitely not worth what I paid. I do several readings per day and this will never hold up. This one is going back. The description should be clearer that these are not standard quality cards."
3476,3,"I love the artwork of this deck. It came in a beautiful box with a magnet flap, and I was so blown away by the quality. And the book is glossy and lovely and wonderful! But then I excitedly unwrapped the cards from the plastic and realized there was one part of this deck that was not so great. The card stock for the actual cards. It is thin and feels so fragile and easy to bend. I cannot imagine using these regularly, or even just sometimes. The idea of shuffling them is unnerving because they are basically printed on a step above a sheet of paper. My business cards are thicker card stock than these! And it is so sad because they are beautiful and I love the artwork, the book and the box. But the cards are not at all for everyday, they are far too thin and delicate for regular use of any kind. I was very disapointed, which sucks because they really made me happy art and style wise. I just don't understand why anyone would print their deck like this! If there is a reprint on higher quality card stock i would immediately purchase them."
3477,1,"Summary: I'm so in love with this tarot deck -- EXCEPT that it just features white witches. This is not a little thing. This is a big, big problem. There was zero reason to do that. I'm hoping they'll have an updated edition soon to improve that.-------I love the feel & tone of this deck. Cats are in every image, most of the cards contain broomsticks, pointy black hats & striped leggings. It's the perfect witchy deck for those of us witches who love our Halloween-esque aesthetics 24/7 (I am one of those -- I'd have my garlands out year-round if my housemates would let me).Elisabeth Alba is an exceptional illustrator. Every card is so finely inked and painted that it's quickly become my favorite deck to look at -- and to use! Deborah Blake and Alba's interpretations on the traditional RW are spot-on (for example, the Hermit is a witch in the woods around a bonfire, surrounded by woodland creatures peering out of the dark). Blake's book is funny, insightful, and on-point, and even though I've been reading the cards for many years, I've learned a lot from this book. Design, witchy tone / feel, and book are all great.However, there's a BIG caveat that unfortunately overshadow all my other feelings about this deck. There are almost no people of color in this deck (there are a few cards that are just sliiiiightly ambiguous). Why?!??!?!!?!??! Why why why why why why why why WHYYYYY???? Our witchy community is so much bigger than this!! We should be better than this & more aware by now.Every time I use these cards, my heart breaks a little because I just don't understand how & why the creators could so blatantly overlook and ignore so many of our kindred witches. It seems like a glaring oversight (and I'm hoping it's just that, rather than a deliberate whitewashing choice). Not all witches are white. Not all clients are white. Plenty of people of all colors wear striped stockings and use wands and have cats and cast spells. C'mon, people!! This deck was supposed to be better than that, yet it's just another deck for (exclusively) white witches. **I'm a white witch. And I don't want any more all-white decks.** They are exclusionary and continue an age-old legacy of ignoring & erasing our fellow witches when they're people of color, and we cannot continue that legacy any more.What makes it even more confusing is that the creators of the deck even made special efforts to be diverse & inclusive, but **only** when it comes to gender & queerness. Some characters are male witches, and some are even gender-ambiguous (Blake mentions this very fact in the accompanying book), which I whole-heartedly applaud. I'm a queer witch, so that's awesome. However, this makes it even more painful to realize that, while the creators thought through *some* aspects of diversity, they ignored race.There are maybe 5-10 cards that aren't pearly peachy lily white, so could potentially represent witches of color, but I have to wonder:a) Why are there so few of these cards?b) Why didn't the illustrators make them more obvious? All of the other cards have characters of *obvious* caucasian descent, so why aren't there witches here of obvious Asian, African, Native American, Latin American, etc. descent?c) How could they not even think this through for the Hierophant card? This card features three witches practicing yoga -- and, you guessed it -- all of them, *including* the lead yogi, are white. Not even the teacher herself is of Indian descent. They are allllll white. Gag me.It makes me sad to think that, as witches, we all still have so far to go. We are better than this. Our community is bigger & wider than this. We have an OBLIGATION to ourselves & to each other to be more inclusive, representative, and loving. Why are we still seeing so many exclusively-white decks out there?! This design practice totally erases entire groups of people, and is a slap in the face to so many people in our community. It also makes this deck really hard to read with, professionally, because many of my clients and friends are people and women of color.I'm hoping Alba & Blake will release a new edition of this deck that incorporates MANY MANY MANY more obvious women of color. Sure, keep in some ethnically-ambiguous cards, too! I'm not saying that's a bad thing. But it's so far from being enough that it's frankly insulting. If they come out with a new version that's more open & loving & inclusive & respectful of our wider community, I'd buy it in a heartbeat -- and then buy one for every witch I know. That's how good the deck is and *could be* once it's updated to be more representative of our fellow witches of color."
3478,2,"The card stock is horrible! It's flimsy, thin paper. Definitely not worth what I paid. I do several readings per day and this will never hold up. This one is going back. The description should be clearer that these are not standard quality cards."
3479,3,"I absolutely love the illustrations on these cards - they're whimsical & adorable. I really wish Llewellyn would start using sturdier card stock. The last 3 decks I bought of theirs, are all way too thin, easily bendable & easily scuffed on the edges. I can see that with regular use, these cards will NOT last. Very disappointed. These are cheesy."
3480,2,"These cards are printed on the absolute worst card stock I have ever seen/felt. It is one step above paper. I ignored the negative reviews concerning this, because my other experiences with negative reviews about card stock issues proved incorrect. However, THESE cards would be one use only, unless you want curled cards. The slightest pressure causes them to bend, with absolutely no flexibility to spring back to their original shape. I am returning these, as they are a waste of money."
3481,2,"I will say don’t be completely put off by some of the reviews of the cardstock, but do be a little weary. I bought this deck twice in the last month: one for a friend’s birthday, one for me. My friend’s deck is beautiful so I thought get it for myself. It came in today and I have to say I’m pretty disappointed. The cardstock isn’t anything like her deck at all. It’s cheap, flimsy, the first couple of cards have some light damage to their edges and the 3 of Cups has a scratch on it. Gonna have to return this one <U+0001F615>*Update (6.14.2018)*Decided to try again (3rd time). While this time, the cards got the lamination and a full color book, the cardstock still feels really flimsy compared to my friend’s deck. All I’ve done is handle this deck (not even shuffling) and there’s already some wear at the edges. I don’t mind thin cardstock, I have some, but this is really subpar quality. Guess I’ll return this one as well and just give up on this deck altogether."
3482,3,"I LOVE this deck- this is not a review of the artwork at all. This is a review of the cardstock- it SUCKS. They are thin, bend very easily and they don't shuffle well. As a result I haven't really used this deck. Part of me wants to keep it because I love the artwork, but it sucks to not be able to use it properly."
3483,2,"The artwork is stunning, although there are a few cards that don't completely feel like they fit the whole aesthetic, and I know she did re-draw some when it switched from her own printing to this new printer. The quality of the cards is absolutely awful, and that's no fault of the artist but if I were here I would be pissed, because they are barely better than printer cardstock and aren't really useable. Llewellyn needs to go with a different manufacturer to do this art justice."
3484,3,"A lot of people here complain about the cardstock. I knew that going in but didn't take it too seriously. I figure that as long as I can shuffle the deck it's fine if they get a little bent. The more ""used"" the more imbued with my energy they'll be. But this deck is truly sad. The first time I shuffled cards were catching on each other and pulling at their edges. After only one reading the tops and bottoms of half the cards were already nicked and dented. They are so, so thin. Put two pieces of standard printer paper together and that's the thickness of each card, though they are slightly sturdier than plain paper. This gets two stars simply for the artwork. It's the only deck I've found that I feel connected to the imagery and if the cardstock was better it would easily get five stars from me."
3485,2,"The packaging of this spirit animal deck is gorgeous, but once you get past the glittery silver snakeskin exterior, the deck itself is disappointing. As many have pointed out, the cardstock is of inferior quality. In addition, the illustrations vary widely in quality from card to card. Some animals are rendered thoughtfully and artistically--some look like amateur scribbles. The descriptions of the card meanings are very short and in a hard-to-read font. I returned the deck."
3486,3,"Bought this item as a gift for my girlfriend to go along with her Tarot deck she has and loves. We both love the concepts and artwork behind this deck. To our displeasure, upon opening the deck, brand new from plastic, we noticed that we were missing a main card and the very last card of the deck, the Cosmic Egg. We will be exchanging this deck out for another and are hopeful for better luck. We both highly recommend this deck but, are disappointed in the incomplete deck we received."
3487,3,"I was really excited to receive the cards, especially as I had seen the Wild Unknown deck, but overall the car quality is much poorer and the cards were not even cut properly. it seems that this was a more downscale mass produced version for everyone else. So after pre-ordering and anxiously waiting I was severely disappointed that such a nice product has been ruined by poor production."
3488,1,"DISCLAIMER, CAME WITH CARDS DAMAGED.This is clearly a fault of the MASS publisher Harper, because it was brand new. When I called the publishing company they refused to send me replacement cards. Even though it was their error. All the other tarot card companies issue replacement cards. The cardstock is very thin and terrible. This product had a potential to be great, but it seems making money is more important to the creator of the deck then making quality cards."
3489,2,"I'm never excited to leave a negative review. It's even ouchier in this case, because I love Kim Krans work so much. Alas, I've completely given up on this otherwise half-assed deck, and every time I pull from the Animal Oracle Deck I love, I am reminded to post this review so that no one else wastes their money thinking they're going to get a solid, well-flushed out divination tool. The main problem with this deck - well, actually it's the accompanying guidebook that's the primary issue - is that it's written from an extremely subjective lens of perception. The author doesn't acknowledge both the gifts and the shadows fundamentally laden within each animal totem, rather she skews the descriptions based on her own experience or point of view, which makes for a very lopsided deck, and definitely muddles the clarity it supposedly transmits. It definitely seems like Krans has a very limited understanding of the animal spirits, and of the larger metaphysical truth that renders even the shadowiest of archetypes bearers of great blessings. As beautiful as this deck is drawn, I find it utterly useless for any real 5D insight because of all these aforementioned shortcomings. Apologies to Kim for not being more positive, but I feel beholden to the larger truths, and to my fellow consumers who might not be budgeted for decks that don't deliver. Onwards, we grow...."
3490,1,"I was told not to read this book because it is not in keeping with Yahoveh's wishes. I came to understand that it is rated as ""Magic"" or ""Obeah"". I try to stay far from people and books that are associated with witchcraft. I want to be pure. I want to conquer evil and curses that were set on me by the Anglican Priest Monrelle Williams since 1996. For the past 20 years I have been tossed up and down, rejected, hated without cause, denied promotions to favour persons qualified and able to work effectively with persons, loss of salary, now threats by bank to rob me out of my house by renewing my mortgage in 208 without the necessary legal papers or my signature. Instead they used my signature of April 7th, 2011 when I went to transact other business in the bank, to validate their refinancing of my mortgage. No one is trying to correct it and I have no money to engage the services of a lawyer. I have to fight them on my own by going public in a few days."
3491,3,"Have been doing Tarot for years but am always interested in new books; in fact, I collect books and cards because there are so many different decks of cards even though they represent the same thing. Missed the fact that there were no pictures in Lisa's book but that doesn't mean it does not have its merit. For the beginner, sort of helps to see the card so one can associate it with its meaning especially since it can have a completely different meaning reversed. Note: I am a visual person and this is just my opinion; no discredit to the book."
3492,2,"I purchased this book. Most of it is really great. However, I noticed that in the back of the book, it gives you some spreads to do. In the Celtic cross pread- the definition and placement of each card do not match up. In the diagram all the cards are labeled with a number. In the definition for each card, it's not the same. I have left a few pictures to show what I mean."
3493,3,"I’m sorry. I’m really not liking this author. This is the 4th book I am reading of hers. Her books are to generalized. It feels like she read a bunch of information, took notes and added her own “touches” to the writing. Her interpretation of the cards, are literally just the basics that often come included with the deck you purchase. better books are available on cards for beginners. I’m still a beginner myself. Just knowing basic meanings, ends up in becoming confusing interpretations."
3494,3,"I received a defective Good Tarot deck and I'm very unhappy with my purchase. Most cards were misprinted and uneven on all four sides. The inside of the box had dark scuff marks. There was peeling along the edges of the cards. I can see why some reviews had noted that this type of card stock would not hold up with normal use. The deck is extremely thick, the cards stick together because of the sticky glossy laminate finish and the cards are so large that it is not functional. This deck is so big and bulky that it is impossible to hold comfortably or to shuffle. The artwork is ok. I do not like that most of the women depicted in the major arcana and suit cards such as the High Priestess and Empress look like teenage girls. Like other reviews have mentioned, there isn't a lot of detail in the background at all and most images do not make sense in relationship to the card title/meaning. This is in no way a functional tarot deck. This is an oracle deck that the author intended to be used for one to three card readings. The guidebook is very hard to read because the font is very small and strains the eyes. There are several typos and misprints in the guidebook. The word ""God"" and ""Spirit"" are mixed up in the guidebook descriptions. If this is going to be a divination system for all faiths to use, maybe ""The Divine or The Universe"" would have been a better choice of words. Not everyone resonates with the word ""God"". There are no traditional meanings given for the cards so it is very confusing for newer cards to be interpreted such as ""Temptation, Call, Transformation ect."" There isn't enough detail in any of the cards for your intuition to pick up on either. The short affirmations on each cards are very airy fairy new age in tone and not practical sage advice to really help anyone. I also didn't care for the first person language used in the affirmations. This makes it very difficult if you wanted to perform a reading for another person. I just can't see how this deck can be helpful or offer anyone deeper insight into their lives. I really wanted to love this deck and I've been wanting it for a very long time but it was nothing like I expected. Even though this deck is positive in nature, it is lacking in so many ways. Overall the Good Tarot is a huge disappointment and definitely not worth all the hype. Hay House also needs to work on quality control issues with their printing and processing methods."
3495,3,"This is VERY disappointing. It is certainly lovely artwork (thus two stars). It is NOT Tarot. Goodness separated from challenge is impractical, unrealistic, and meaningless - like knitting without the yarn. Our challenges & adversity lead us to growth & the development of our abilities, self-discovery, and potentials. Colette knows this as is evident in her booklet - even she cannot remove this deck entirely from adversity despite her efforts. Tarot is objective, neutral - good & bad lie within people's perspectives & fear is born of ignorance. There is nothing to fear in true Tarot. The symbology here is random and nebulous at best, by & large limited in the extreme. While lovely the images are unclear, hazy - even with a magnifying glass. Thus the Major Arcana has lost its potency entirety. What has a woman looking away from the reader have to do with patience? What on earth is the significance of a giraffe here? Without the booklet to explain each card, one is challenged to find any correlation between the card's image and meaning in either arcana. And reducing the suits to simple elements completely removes the full significance and vast depth the suits are designed to convey. So goes the broad psychological value and insightful clarity of the lesser arcana. Again there is little to no symbology to guide or feed the intuition on any card. What remains is make believe. By her own admission, this is simply another of Colette's oracle decks, and I expected much better from her. I honor her intention, but the result is sadly lacking. I wonder at her understanding of the true philosophy of Tarot? The art work IS beautiful, but this is certainly not a Tarot deck, much less a 'good' one."
3496,3,While the pictures are beautiful this deck has little to do with the actual tarot. The illustrations are again beautiful but opaque not full of symbolism and meaning. I have been a professional reader my entire life and was very excited to get these cards - I learned how to read cards 30 + years ago and have bought dozens of decks in hopes of finding a beautiful and usable version of the tarot and had been disappointed so many times before because while they may look pretty or interesting- they are pretty useless as actual oracles. This is my take on this deck. There has been WAY TOO MUCH liscence taken with the symbolism without anything taking its place. I was SOOOO looking forward to this deck- hopeful that this newly illustrated version would be an elevated version of the Ryder-Wait deck but instead it is just a bunch of pretty useless pictures I am sad to say. If you are new to reading stay away from this deck and buy yourself some version of the Ryder deck. I can't use these in my work- they feel to me like illustrations that were lying around and attached arbitrarily to the card positions. <U+0001F62A>
3497,3,"In an effort to be ""good"", the images are vague, lack detail, and are washed out. I couldn't even put together enough readable cards to make an improvised oracle deck from a handful of them, the images and their subjects are so unfocused and lacking in symbolism of any kind. (Why does 6 of Water look like she has a stomach ache? Why have so many men in the Major Arcana been randomly replaced by animals?) The cards are over-sized and on heavy, laminated cardstock/cardboard, so they will be fun as jumping off points for art projects. But that's not what I bought them for."
3498,2,"I ordered these to use for meetings with Dell laptop so working microphone is very important to me. I also wanted to listen to music on occasion but that was less important. These headphones are very well made and comfortable enough for at least an hour. I do not have a large head but if you do, they may be a bit tight.Headphones appear to be well made, it is amazing how good they are for the price. They also sound very good to my ears. In fact in the short time I used them I could not find any flaws except for not working microphone. The microphone does not work with Dell laptop or the thunderbolt dock to which laptop is connected. There is just no signal at all coming from microphone. The button press causes loud click in headphones and nothing else. I have used other headphones with this computer and dock and they all worked including all buttons.I have tested them these headphones with a cell and a tablet and in both cases microphone works. I don't know what the button supposed to do as I have not tested it.I wish the microphone worked because I really liked the headphones but now I have to find something else. Description of the headphones should mention that microphone do not work with PC."
3499,2,"I agree that these head phones have very good sound, and seem to have good noise isolation somehow. it's great for the price, small size, light weight and very portable.but comfortable? I beg to differ. I can't keep these on for more than 10min, or 15min max. Each time I take them off, I can feel pain in ear lobe and top of ear area; the headphones compress my ears/head too much. I wanted to keep these, but just can't tolerate the pain, and not worth it to me. I suspect all on-the-ear head phones will do this to you.They might be ok if you got small ears, or under 10yrs old."
3500,3,"These headphones are built well and put out a pretty good sound, but are very tight. I'm 6' tall and my head is slightly smaller in proportion to my body, and this headset puts a lot of pressure on my ears. The material that is used and padding around the ear pieces are decent, but the band's bend is way too tight forcing the ear pads to cause discomfort to my ears and sides of my head. I can only wear these about 30-60 minutes at a time, then I need to take them off for a break. I've been forcefully stretching them (placing the ear pads on either end of an 11"" book) for many hours during the day, and throughout the night, but it hasn't been helping too much. I've only had these about a week and half, so I'm hoping they'll stretch out to give more comfort down the road."
3501,3,I recently purchased these headphones for my son . He uses them to play his PlayStation 4 . He immediately placed the headphones on my ear so I can hear all the static coming from the headphones. I’m really disappointed at the product and I’d like a replacement.
3502,3,Openings in ear pads do not cover ears. Nor do they pivotmaking them uncomfortable for prolonged wear. May work fine for children but do not recommend for adults. Sound quality is fair to good.
3503,2,"Battery life is awful. I used them at work for a day after a full charge and they died half way thru my next work day. They also have no low battery signal/message, they just turn off and disconnect from your phone. The noise canceling doesn't cancel anything, without the noise canceling on, it actually sounds like white noise is being pumped thru the headphones. They aren't very loud at all, my $25 bluedio headphones have much louder and better quality sound. One good thing at least is that they feel nice on my head. Lastly, the last time I used them, they just started making this super loud high-pitched squeel that wouldn't stop until fiugred out to turn off the noise canceling feature. I then couldn't get them to turn off so I let them die. Now I'm just going to return them."
3504,2,"I don't trust many of the reviews as they talk about great things about this product. iTeknik headphone is a deceptively advertised item. It could be having a basic noise cancellation function but it does not have a hybrid mic outside as advertised in the listing. In fact, the packing box also does not mention about the hybrid technology anywhere. Please do not spend this much money on this poor quality item. I have tested it for a few days and had to return it as I was highly dissatisfied."
3505,3,"If I had paid more than $45 I would have been quite upset. How these have such high reviews is beyond me... Fake reviews? I'm considering sending them back shelling out real money for real headphones.These remind me of beats... Just muddy sounding. No crisp or clear sounds. It's noticeably bad. But hey, they're well under 100 bucks so....?? Don't listen to the reviews saying they're similar to bose or Sony... These are not even close to the same category.updateYeah, I sent these back. Couldn't justify even spending $40 on muddy sounding headphones. Bad audio drives me insane. Shelling out more money for the Sony 950N1."
3506,3,"I was very impressed with the reviews for this product, so I decided to buy.The headphones arrived less than 20 minutes ago and I’m ready to send them back, dissatisfied.“Noise cancelling,” my foot! I tried listening to music and a white noise fan sleep aid app through these and, without having the volume at a near-uncomfortable level, I could still hear someone speaking to me just fine. I could also still hear a blender about 20 feet away. A plane cabin can be far louder than a blender, so good freaking luck! Speech and the blender were cancelled if I turned up the volume to about 60% of max, but again, that was too loud for me. Thoroughly unimpressed. And I’d like to add that this was my first purchase of any noise canceling device, so I’m not comparing it to anything else."
3507,3,I purchased these to help reduce noise on airplane flights and listen to music/watch videos. The build quality is actually impressive for the price although a bit on the heavy side. The sound quality however was terrible and was tinny highs and overly emphasized bass to the point of it being muddy. The noise cancellation does not cut the back seat test in the Boeing 717 or MD 90. Don't expect these to cut out all the noise. They do cut down the low end rumbles pretty well but just don't cut it on the high pitch end of the spectrum. Don't expect high quality sound from these if you like listening to higher quality audio.
3508,2,"It's been 4 months since I bought these headphones, and the sound in the right ear has recently started going in and out. I have to maneuver the wiring with tape on the left side in order to KEEP the sound in the right ear. My headphones always go out in one ear eventually, but never THIS quickly.October 2018 EDIT: I was sent another pair for free shortly after posting my initial review, but these too are acting up. If the wire gets moved (whenever I move my head in any direction), it can result in static, the sound coming out in only one ear, or silence. Going to have to purchase a different pair of headphones."
3509,3,"I purchased two of these on Aug 18. 2017. One failed in approximately 90 days and one in 110 days. Both outside the Amazon return window. Requested help (or at least sympathy..lol) from the shipper and received none. I do recognize that the shipper does not warrant the product; however, they normally have a better rapport with the manufacturer they represent. The units worked great until they both failed to pair with any of several devices they had been pairing with. This is the first negative review I can remember giving."
3510,3,"First off I'd like to clarify that I am by no means a audiophile, but have had my fair share of headphones in the past. Personally I don't think you should have to pay your months rent for a pair, but if they're too inexpensive it does raise some flags, that being said I do have a few that definitely breaks the mold that you have to pay more to get more. Which is what brought me to these, the mixture of pages of glowing reviews and even articles written by so called audiophiles, plus the price tag I would have been crazy not to jump on them right? I was beside myself with excitement when they arrived, I was going to be the proud owner of budget Beats! As far as looks go they are very aesthetically pleasing, they look nothing like you paid $34.99 that's great. The booklet stated that they needed to be charged for 4 hours before the first listen, it wasn't very long after I had them hooked up, maybe 2 hours if not that long the charging led shut off. It certainly wasn't the full 4 hours, I thought that was pretty odd but didn't put too much into it, the important thing was the sound.Another little cool feature is these headphones have voice commands never seen that on a pair before, now onto the sound. Putting it simple the sound is garbage, the bass if you can consider it as such is so muddy and muffled it almost sounds like the music is coming out of a hole, I had to turn my volume up to max and even then the sound was still horrendous. Now after all that I have to really wonder about all these beaming reviews, how many are authentic and how many are fabricated, that seems to be an ongoing issue on Amazon, I have learned if you want a truthful review on a product or an unbiased one that points out the bad as well as the good, look up 4 star and below ratings. If I had done so in the beginning I would have had more insight on the performance and been able to make a better thoughtfull purchase. The only pros to these are the look/design and voice command features, quite a few people were upset over the fact they don't seem to last long and have issues with connection, the fact that they seem not to come to a full4 hour charge could have meant trouble down the road as well. In this case you definitely get what you pay for."
3511,3,"This headphone set has poor sound quality: it lacks midrange, and attempts to compensate by boosting treble and bass, but in a bad way. Mids are still scooped & music sounds poor & cheap.The hissing white noise is intolerable, unless you like white noise then these are perfect for your youtube noise videos.I tested these with (remastered) Led Zeppelin, Physical Graffiti, and Hillsong United, Zion. I would've also tested with Maxim Vengerov or a Rachmaninov concerto but didn't bother after listening to two albums.I'm not an expert but I am a musician with sound engineer experience."
3512,3,"*UPDATE* March 2018: 1 starInitially, I really liked these headphones, but now after using them regularly over the past few months, my opinion has totally changed. (see original review below) For the first few months, they worked great, but now I regularly get these VERY loud interruptions to the audio I am listening to. Intermittently, the speakers will produce a VERY loud distortion sound that I can best describe as a combination of fuzzy static and a loud screech. It is always much much louder than whatever I am listening to which is completely jarring, and honestly quite frightening when listening to something quieter/gentler. (It is so unexpected and loud that it has made me physically jump). This is now happening more and more frequently, now occurring multiple times during a listening session (30min - 2hrs).This issue can't be caused by wear and tear because I have never even dropped my headphones or subjected them to any physical handing that would cause damage. They are either on my ears, or sitting on my desk.I also know that this issue can't be caused by a specific app or my phone, because it consistently occurs with multiple apps while using the headphones and has never occurred with any other bluetooth (or wired) device I have used with my phone.Overall, I am very disappointed with these, especially since I spent a lot of time shopping around and I thought I had finally found a reliable pair of bluetooth headphones.October 2017 Review: 5 starsWorks well. Great sounds. Easy and fast Bluetooth connection. Only complaint is that it's a bit tight on my ears and they get a little sore after awhile."
3513,3,"After seeing all the high reviews for these headphones, I purchased them with the expectation that they were going to be amazing, I came to the realization that those reviews were not accurate. I’m of the belief that those high reviews were left after the initial use of the headphones.Construction quality - They feel flimsy at best. The earphones are comfortable but the unit tends to slide off of ones head and doesn’t stay in place. After using them for a few months one of the earphones broke away from the unit and is only hanging by a wire. For the life of me I can’t figure out how it happened or how it was even staying in place.Active Noise Cancelling - this worked great at first and after a while they had problems with periodically make a high pitched noise. The only remedy to this noise would be to turn off the active noise cancellation. When the active noise cancellation is in use another noise would emanate on the track is skipped or the music is stopped/started. In other words, don’t touch the headphones when the active noise cancellation is in use.Battery life - Amazing! I could use them for over a week on a single charge.Sound Quality - The loudness is good, the lows are muffled and the bass in certain music makes it sound as if the drivers aren’t able to reproduce the frequency accurately."
3514,2,"I've had these for 6 months and they were doing great until today when the left ear piece broke. I bought these for using at my desk, so I don't move them around. So, they shouldn't have broken because there is no wear and tear on them. When not in use, they sit on my desk. I was surprised today when I picked them up to find the headphones broken. They no long lay flat against my left ear. Before they broke, the sound quality was good but not 100% noise cancelling. They do block out a good amount of sound but if you want true noise cancelling headphones, these are not it. They are comfortable as I could wear them for basically 8 hours a day. But they are a bit bulky. Since they broke, I need to find a new pair. I don't know that I'll be purchasing these again."
3515,3,"I was so excited to get these. I opened the box and tried them on; they seemed pretty comfortable. I plugged them in and left them to charge. The next day, I came home from work, popped them on, and switched the noice cancellation on. I paired them with my iMac, watched a YouTube video, and was happy. Turned them off, and went about my business. A couple of days later, I sat down to do some audio editing. Fired up the headphones, and they immediately connected to my computer. So far, so good.But then, I heard a little static in the right ear. I moved the switch away from sound-cancelling to bluetooth-only. the static went away. I switched the sound-cancelling back on, and the static returned. I turned the headphones off, disabled my bluetooth, turn the headphones back on, and turned my computer's bluetooth back on. The static was gone. Satisfied, I watched a quick video before getting back to work, and suddenly ear-splitting static assaulted my right side. I yanked the headphones off and held them at arm's length. Overly dramatic? Sure. But I could still hear the static clearly from arm's length away.To be clear, I didn't have the volume up particularly loud. I have some hearing damage already, and am very protective of what I've got left. The static was loud, painfully so.[EDIT]Cowin saw my negative review, and reached out to me very quickly. They gave me a coupon code to try the E7 Pro, ostensibly a better model. So, as far as customer service goes, Cowin is a good company. The new headphones were also a disappointment, though; you can find my review there."
3516,2,"EDIT: Updating my reviewI was apprehensive about these headphones because they're very heavy and I bought them for their noise-canceling abilities.I got them to use in a noisy open office. I am very gentle with them and they don't have to travel around in a backpack or anything, but I am wearing them for over 5 hours a day.They block out ambient sounds like air conditioners and mild background chatter, but they really don't block out voices of people near you, even if you're playing louder music.7 months after buying these things the headphones now make a tinny noise in the left ear. Its INCREDIBLY annoying, I feel like I have tinnitus when I'm wearing these things. The tinnny noise gets softer if I play audio, but it is still there.I'm glad they lasted over 6 months, but I still REALLY regret buying these things. They gave up after 7 months and are completely unusable."
3517,1,"I was a fresh college graduate looking for an affordable, reliable, and quality pair of Bluetooth headphones. One year later and I am still in love with these! The sound quality is fantastic, they look sleek and aesthetic, and Bluetooth syncing is never a problem. The product also comes with a good carrying bag, charger, and audio cable. Highly recommend a pair for all those trying to ball on a budget! You will not regret it!Update (1 year 2 months later): SO SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED with these...I was listening to some casual nighttime jazz while writing an email when I heard a cracking sound. Lo' and behold I found the ear module detached from the overhead component. Don't buy these if you are looking for a durable pair of headphones. As I look back at what I said in my initial review, I realize these aren't the most affordable headphones on the internet so I take that back. They break so they're clearly not reliable. Quality was great until AGAIN: they broke! Hard to appreciate sound quality when you can't put the headphones on your head. Sleek/Aesthetic? Yes, I'm bitter so yeah, I've seen better-looking headphones. I do NOT recommend a pair because you will neither be balling nor on a budget when you end up as flabbergasted as I am.Why would you not spend a little time making sure the overarching piece is securely holding the earpieces?? Poor engineering. OH and don't fall for the gimmicky little video with the hired actors showing how much they LOOOVE these headphones. Save yourself the money and frustration. Keeping clicking on for other suggested headphones my fellow Amazon shoppers."
3518,1,"YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS ITEM IF IT ARRIVES DEFECTIVE.These headphones in and of themselves aren't bad. They're comfortable, somewhat sound-canceling. The sound is not crisp--it's fuzzy--but it isn't terrible. The problem was that the very first time I used them, the sound in each speaker cut in and out as I walked. Poor wiring somewhere. So I tried to return it. NO DICE. This item is not eligible for returns on Amazon. You have to contact Panasonic themselves via phone. I did so. Panasonic said they would only do exchanges, not returns, and I had to contact Amazon (and by the way, Amazon's customer service phone number is 1 (888) 280-4331 and they were lovely). It was the only way to get a refund. Buying this product is obviously a crapshoot. I wouldn't risk it."
3519,3,"After nearly a month I am pleased with these. They are comfortable and allow some outside sounds to reach the listener (the Wife) when necessary. Comfortable, even when lying in bed listening to an audible book. The long cord kind of gets in the way (as did a short cord on the old ones) but is worth the very minor annoyance to place the audible reader where I want it.UPDATE -- Sept. 17, 2018Bought these in January 2018 and by the end of August stopped working. Out of warranty. They weren't expensive but I only want them for audio books, I'm functionally blind and unable to read print without complicated electronic aids. If these headphones had lasted at the very least a year I would have updated with a 2 or 3 stars. I recently purchased KOSS UR 20 for a few dollars more and I like the fit and look better (also an 8' cord) and I hope they get longer trouble free use."
3520,3,"We bought these headphones, trusting the Panasonic name and the great reviews but are very disappointed. We bought these to replace another, nicer set of Panasonic headphones that had stopped working on one side. Our boys use them for the long car rides we often have during summer and holiday travel but they used them for the first time the other day and they were so quiet they couldn't hear over the noise of the car which wasn't loud. I thought the kids had some settings messed up in their tablets or there was some hidden volume control on the headphones that would fix the problem but I was wrong... they're just wicked quiet! Unfortunately, at this price, it isn't even worth the hassle to send them back."
3521,2,Very poor quality plastic. Bought 3 of these to use on a 1200 mile drive... Only one pair made it there and none made it back. The plastic is very brittle and snaps easily...I purchased other inexpensive headphones at truck stops along the way and all of the replacements are still working...I purchased these because of the Panasonic name thinking they would be better quality than a generic. I was wrong.
3522,3,"The good:They work well and I'm glad I only purchased them for $10.The bad:They are extremely uncomfortable to wear. They are not shaped for a human head and would probably fit a box better. I hate wearing them, but fortunately I'm only using them for 30 minutes or so at a time. In addition to being uncomfortable they are surprisingly heavy. Not worth returning, but certainly a poorly made product."
3523,1,This is the worst headphones I have ever bought. The treble is very bad and I hope you don't like bass because your not getting any of that. When I turned up the volume on the computer I keep hearing a tick like sound which is very disturbing. To me this seems like it should cost about $5.00 - $10.00 at the most. The headphones started to hurt my ears after wearing them for about 15 minutes. Buyers beware of what your getting which is the point of this review.
3524,2,"I was very excited to try when received the package an hour ago but excitement was short lived. When I tried playing some songs I was surprised that sound is muffled not clear while using the spiral cord but it works fine with other male to male 3.5 cord. but while using the spiral cord it It seems that sound is coming from distant far, bass and other sound are suppressed. I have tried the headphone along with spiral cord on computer and on two phones (iphone and android), result is same. I do not have similar cord with 6.3 mm and 3.5 mm jack to try. I have rated two star as the headphone does not work as expected with 6.3 mm cable but works fine with other 3.5 to 3.5 cable. Issue could be either with 6.3 mm socket or cable. I would return the headphone."
3525,2,Pros: Decent highs and sounds were precise. Made sounds like you were in a large room. Detachable cords.Cons: Headband was adjusted to max and still was too small to fit around my head. I also wear glasses and the headphones pushed against my head hard enough to give me a headache. Very uncomfortable to wear. I could not wear it for more than 10 minutes. The bass response was not very punchy and seemed very soft and distant. The angle of the ear cups didn't fit well and did not totally surround my ear and some of the sound quality was lost.I had to return these because they were just too uncomfortable to wear.
3526,1,"I've had this headset for about half a year. Like most cheap audio products on Amazon made by Chinese manufacturers, you get what you pay for. However, with most that I've purchased the customer service has been great. If something breaks or stops working, I've never had an issue getting a replacement with no hassles. However, OneOdio is the exception. The soft foam part of the headset recently came off and there is no way to reattach it without it falling off again. I e-mailed the manufacturer asking for a replacement as there is a 24 Month Warranty on the product. They were slow to respond and instead of offering to replace the product, they asked me to try and fix it by sending me a video attached to an e-mail. First of all, I am not going to download a video attached to an e-mail. I've had enough issues with identify theft and viruses, besides it is not my responsibility to fix a defective product. Second, when I clicked on a link to their website with the video embedded, it's all in Chinese. And when I asked for a replacement again stating that it's not my responsibility to fix something that is clearly a problem with the product as there is no noticeable wear and tear to the device itself (I'm careful with my equipment), they ignored my e-mail.Anyway, buyer beware. You definitely get what you pay for. Given that there are a lot of competing devices of similar build quality (mostly made in China) pick one with better customer service and one who honors their warranty. The device itself is fine, it's about what you would expect for a 30 dollar set of headphones. Nothing fancy. Doesn't cancel noise or anything like that. It fits comfortably enough on my ears, but given that the cushion has come off, there's no way to wear it without it falling off after a short while."
3527,1,"When I received this product it seemed okay. Not great, but sufficient. Seemed like it was gonna do the job but after only 8 months of using them very sporadically (MAYBE 12 gigs??) one of the ear pieces came unattached from the main part. The cord is still attached so you can still hear out of that ear piece, however the headphones are no longer wearable without physically holding them up. Spend a little more and get a pair that will actually hold up to mild usage. I am very careful with my equipment, these are junk."
3528,3,"I’m so upset with these headphones- when they came I loved how snug they fit and how well the sound was. I love that I can use the microphone too and it has worked well. So I immediately threw out the box excited I had new headphones (mine had broken the day before, which I had for 7 years, so I was nervous and excited for a new pair!)Then two days later these headphones start acting crazy. If I move the wire at all, it stops my music from playing (on iPhones if you disconnect your headphones your music pauses). And I mean I’m sitting on the train right now and jist the bumps of the train are making the wire move just ever so slightly enough that my music stops every 20 seconds. It’s infuriating! I love over the head headphones particularly for when I go on a run, but there’s no way these will work because my music will definitely stop every 30 seconds and that’s just way too frustrating. I wish I could try exchanging these but I threw the box out so I guess I’m SOL."
3529,1,Don’t order these. Wasted my time replacing and trying a new pair from Amazon just in case the awful quality was an error. It’s not. It’s just the way these headphones are made. The sound is extremely muffled. Sounds far away and terrible. Don’t waste your money and the hassle of dealing with Amazon returns.
3530,2,"We have two boys and they needed some new and bigger headphones since they have outgrown the ones we bought them a few years ago. The headphones are attractive and they come in different colors and look nice. They are foldable which is also a good feature. The sound is mediocre at best though, but for a couple of young boys- they don't notice the difference, nor do they really care at this point. Durability though? Atrocious. Absolutely atrocious. Again, I have two boys, 10 & 11, not toddlers or teenagers, so they are somewhat careful, however they don't abuse the things. Yet, we have gone through 2 pairs of these headphones at this point and in most cases, the plug has either bent or broken off in the headphone jack. I suspect the metal in the plug is not very strong and lacks any real tensile strength. Now, I realize these are $15 headphones from China, but c'mon, they don't even last a month so I'm done with this brand and the cheap headphones. I'm not buying my kids any Bose or anything, but ya gotta spend a bit more then $15 to get a durable set of headphones..."
3531,1,This product is going to cost us more than we spent on it! Got them for my son for Christmas and with only some use since then and the end you plug into a device broke off IN HIS CHROMEBOOK! When he tried to unplug them from it the plug part just split in two. Now we have to take his Chromebook in to be repaired...if it can be AND I get to deal with yet another trip to town to the UPS store for return of a cheap product. I'm starting to rethink my Prime membership even. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!
3532,2,"Very cute looking, but my 12-yr-old daughter refused these as her birthday gift, saying her $5 ear buds are better sound quality than these headphones. I wanted real headphones for her and these did disappoint, but will not be returning them due to return shipping cost. Tried to get my 7-yr-old son to use them for home, but the adjustments dont go small enough to fit him comfortably. Will give to charity-- hope someone enjoys them. Waste of $15."
3533,2,"I got these earphones less than a week ago, and I only wanted them to use at the gym. They worked fine the first time. However, the second and third time, they lost connection to my phone, which was less than one feet away after a few minutes of playing music. I tried restarting my Bluetooth connection, and I tried turning off and turning on the earphones multiple times. Nothing worked unfortunately. The earphones would not gain connection again. This had never happened with other wireless earphones I have bought in Amazon; thus, I have no other reason to conclude that these earphones are defective. It could be that it is my pair, or it could be the brand; I cannot be sure. But I see similar reviews, which makes me think it is a problem with this type of earphones. I am returning the earphones, and I will not be buying again. I am not taking my chances with these ones."
3534,3,"I will break down this review into subsections so you can refer to areas you are concerned about. I will preface this review by saying I am very skeptical of brands I do not know, have not heard of, or have not had others refer me to them, and in fact will stay away from them until one of the three criteria above is met. That being said, my normal headphone provider Skullcandy has had massive amounts of negative reviews on their wireless earbuds, and Amazon said these were the top rated and their suggestion. As such I took the risk and bought them. Now to the review itself.Noise Cancellation: It goes without saying that earbuds in general are noise cancelling as they block a large amount of sound from coming in and personally I do not notice a significant difference between these and my average headphones. They are far less noise cancelling than my gaming headset but I also spent far more on my headset and its designed specifically for that task. Personally, I would say they are noise cancelling, but not more than other earbuds.Sound Quality: I am rather surprised by the sound quality of these considering the price point. A large portion of cost goes into Bluetooth and batteries to keep them on. That being said I had figured the sound quality would be subpar. BOY HOW WRONG WAS I. These things are incredibly nice. If you jack the volume up too high it will get a bit bassy but thats not a big deal considering i listen to them anywhere between 10-50% volume. The microphone quality on these are horrible though. They will pick up and amplify everything. Don't expect to get much out of it.Battery life: My extent of testing the battery life was using them for about an hour, looking at the battery life remaining and seeing 100%. Obviously that is incorrect, but time will tell how long these will actually last.Waterproof or not: Have not tested, however I would assume by the design of these, that would hold true. I have washed older headphones in the wash and dryer multiple times and never had issues, so i would be surprised if newer headphones couldn't do the same. I will update this when i have acquired more data.For Extended Use (Work/Gym/Exercise): These earbuds are very comfy, you cant really tell you are wearing them other than the obvious earbud feeling in your ears. The only concern here is battery life over how often you will use them. I personally work up to 12 hour days, and will wind up having these in almost all of it. The battery will most likely die before I wind up finishing my work day but the good news is there is a fancy pause button on the right ear that will allow me to stop listening to whatever i am listening to at a moments notice and continue right back where i left off when i wish to. Again time will tell.Design Pros/Cons: The volume controls are inverted from what i would expect them to be. On the top of the right ear are two buttons (Easily Accessible). However, the front button is volume down and the back button is up. I personally would have volume up in the front and down in the back, as forward/up and backwards/down, but maybe that's just me being weird. Easy enough play button on the side of the right ear. The left ear has no controls whatsoever and makes the headset appear to be similar to older computer stereos, all controls on a main unit with just a connected speaker by a single wire. This comes with replacement buds, in case the ones currently installed are uncomfortable, and the connecting wire is small, and unnoticeable in my opinion.Recommend or not: For $20 I do not see you getting a better pair of earbuds that are bluetooth with the sound quality yet being very power efficient. That being said, These get a 5 star, despite the 3 star in noise cancellation and 4 in sound quality. Totally Worth it.Edit #1: Changed to a 2 star review After Approximately 3 months of all day use for roughly 80 days over those 3 months I can say the constant recharging has shot the battery. They worked every day fabulously but now i have noticed that the battery lasts roughly 4 hours now when originally it was over 12 hours."
3535,1,"***update 2, feb 21***It’s been 3 months and they are completely dead. Won’t turn on, won’t hold a charge. Garbage.***UPDATE***If you do not let your headset die, and recharge it before it does die, upon turning it on it will automatically connect. To avoid 15 minutes of trying to reconnect the headset to my phone, I guess I will just never let them completely die.Most of the time they will not connect to my iPhone, regardless of restarting both phone and headset multiple times. Very frustrating.I actually dread having to charge them because who knows when and if they will reconnect to my phone. Currently I have been trying for a good ten minutes while writing this review. What a joke.Good material quality, good sound quality, good battery life, if and when it wants to work. Will not buy again, will be returning and do NOT recommend."
3536,3,"The first few seconds of the first song I played with these headphones made it apparent these are cheap and the audio quality is poor. Sounds as if the bass is blaring on these suckers and that is conflicting with the audio qualityUPDATE: LETCOM contacted me numerous times. The first time, I said I would happily accept a proposed refund and if they were willing, would test out another pair of headphones (they claimed they would). Received the refund and that makes me happy, but did not update my rating. They contacted me 6 more times in total and so here is my update."
3537,2,"Owned these for all of 10 days, wore them to the gym twice. The sound was pretty decent and after the first pairing, they connected quickly and easily.Unfortunately, I was getting ready to go to the gym this morning and had them resting aroundmy neck. I went to pull the earbud up to my ear and imagine my surprise when the cord was dangling free having separated in the middle.They had been in their case when not in use, and I did not tug on them at all, much less in a violent way that you would think would cause them to separate like this. Look elsewhere."
3538,3,"Headphone sound is good. But Mic is horrible. It did not work, even at the first meeting. I tried all option to click the button in the wire and adjust it. No luck. The Mic lead me to embarrasment in 2 crucial meeting for my career. I had to opt out and use my mobile phone's and hold it by hand, and could not operate the laptop keyboard.Horrible product. I luckily have an insurance on this product. So i will return and claim a refund.Bad design of the adjustable switch like knob in the Wire.Mic is NOT working.Total failure of the Mic. I am totally disappointed. With Amzaon Choice and this Sony product."
3539,1,"I use it to listen to audio books while exercising on bikes etc. Does excellent job of screening out most of surrounding sound and voice recordings are clear with excellent fidelity. FOUND THAT THEY DO NOT FILTER OUT SURROUNDING SOUNDS.REVISED> after 2 months of light usage, ear pads completely disintegrated into little black plastic pieces. Should have rated a ""0"" but unable to. They are worthless."
3540,2,"I am a stalwart purchaser of Sony products and was disappointed that the mini jack on the end of this headsets cord did not seat itself properly in my sound system. I would guess that it was a freak manufacturing error and not typical. I did manage to get sound out of the set and found that the volume was too low and the sound was not clear but ""muddy"". I purchased the Sony MDR-7506 headphones instead and they have the best sound of any headsets I have ever purchased. Those, I highly recommend."
3541,2,"Mediocre Headphones. From the first day they kept acting up: slight and I mean SLIGHT pressure on the cord (specifically the L shaped part that plugs into your device), will cause songs to skip or pause. Doing that will also activate Google Voice for some odd reason. Imagine listening to your favorite song just to have it be interrupted by Google Voice 30 times, or have it skip to the next song before your favorite part comes on. I’ve purchased headphones from Sony in the past and I’m surprised that I received such a disappointing product."
3542,2,"Bought 25 of these for a computer lab in a school. We usually replace the headphones every year or so as they wear out. These were about $5.00 cheaper per set than any other vendor for the same item. We've already had three of these break in the first two weeks. They are poorly made. The issue is that if the ear pieces are extended for a larger head and then the user removes the headphones by grabbing the ear pieces and pulling out to loosen and remove them, the arms that hold the ear pieces snap. I bought five extra sets just because, but these clearly won't make it though the year.I actually question whether or not these are Sony headphones. They took nearly a month to arrive, were sent from China, and don't appear to have the same fit and finish I'm used to seeing from Sony. You make the call."
3543,3,"I was excited when my shipment arrived, but as soon as I saw the ear buds I knew something was wrong. Instead of the packaging pictured in this listing marked Betron, I received a generic white package that just read, ""Deep Bass.""When I examined the contents the ear buds looked as pictured but I did not get the pouch as was pictured in this listing. Just the ear buds in the generic white box.I crossed my fingers and hoped they sounded as advertised but that didn't happen. The left ear bud kept cutting in and out which was very disappointing. When it was working it sounded pretty good but if you moved it would cut off and you had to play with it to get it working again.I'm totally disappointed.I expected better based on all the positive reviews, but instead it looks like I got somebody's repackaged return that doesn't work properly and was missing parts."
3544,3,"The company contacted me for feedback on the earbuds. I explained the sound was ok but the fit was poor. 3 sets of large ear bud cushions and only 1 set of small were included. They responded that they would not give me new ear bud cushions (I didn't ask). When I said I would provide their response in my feedback, I discovered the company was no longer accepting feedback on this product. I had never seen that before but it looked suspicious. I reported to Amazon and kept trying to add feedback until today it finally accepted it today."
3545,3,"I ordered these and about a month later, the right earbud stopped working. No big deal, I emailed them and they promptly shipped me a replacement pair of headphones. It was a very fast delivery, but did not send any packing to return my device when they said it would either be attached in the email or sent with the package. My new pair of headphones worked well for maybe about two weeks, when the right earbud somehow stopped working. The audio quality was slowly diminishing in both, as well. I use these headphones maybe once every few days, and they are stored in the carrying pouch that Betron provided in the packaging when not in use. I am very disappointed. Granted, these aren't very expensive, but I expected to be able to use them for more than two weeks."
3546,2,"I use these headphones at work. At first they worked out fine, but after a few months the left headphone started shocking me. At first I wasn't sure what it was, but then I realized it was the headphones. I kept using it thinking maybe it was a fluke, but then it kept doing it so finally I had to just throw them away. I hear this popping sound and then sometimes it will lead to a shock. I'm not sure if I just got a defective unit, but I would not buy these again. I did not spillanything on them, I did not drop them, and I always put them away after I was done using them...It was too late for me to return them after the first shock happened.."
3547,1,"These earbuds are huge. I feel like I’m sticking giant metal corn cobs in my ears. I’d forgive the size if they sounded great but the sound is terrible. I’d say the sound quality is below the earbuds included with most phones and tablets. There are no lows and no highs coming through. I feel like I’m listening to the stock AM/FM radio in a 1982 Oldsmobile and that may be giving these earbuds too much credit. I’ve owned many earbuds and these are easily the worst of the bunch. If they were $1, I’d still skip these."
3548,3,"I purchased these to pair with my TV. First time trying to sync and they were discovered, but did not pair. Second time they did not show up on the discover list. I reset everything and tried pairing a third time, they showed up on discover list and did not pair again. When the headphones arrived they did not look brand new, like I may have received a returned or defective item. They were packaged well, so no damage in shipment but the actual box for the headphones was not sealed and looked like it had been opened a few times."
3549,2,"I thought I had found a good pair of headphones for the price I paid. The sound was pretty good, and they felt comfortable to wear. They were only used with my PC at my desk. Four months after I started to use them the right ""arm"" of the headphones snapped, which left the earpiece just dangling from the rest of the headset. Taped it at the joint as best I could so that I could use them until a replacement was found, but of course they do not sit correctly on my head any more. Then the top lining of the headset started to detach, revealing the foam padding underneath. That was good money wasted on these and a lesson learned."
3550,1,"The sound quality is HORRIBLE, zero bass, in general, even when the volume is up to 10, it still sounds like a meow, instead of what a real music sounds like. Battery life: Charged all day, got 1 1/2 hours listening time. It's also not easy to connect to phone. Most importantly, the sound is HORRIBLE!!! Absolutely no bass or treble or anything in between! I bought another one in the same price range MPOW, the difference is night and day considering they're both about under $50. MPOW has super comfy cushion to the ears, and for the price, the depth and the high notes are good, and one charge on last you almost 5 hours of listening to music."
3551,1,"I initially wrote a decent review for these headphones as the product was a good value for the price. However, in the six months since the company has begun cyber stalking me. Initially it was a friendly email saying, ""hey, we've had some issues with these headphones and would like to send a replacement pair."" I responded back thanks, but mine are working fine so there's no need. This began a now 3-month reign of terror with 1-5 emails every week saying the same thing, sometimes personalized from someone named Monica, other times generic. They literally won't quit. I have blocked them and they found a new way to get in. I have reported them to Amazon and they still don't stop. My inbox it littered with their emails. I'm at my wits end here and highly suggest you not buy from this company."
3552,2,"So I am making a brief edit to my review because the company did seem to try to help me with resolving my issue. I returned the original headphones and was offered the option for a replacement to see if they would work better, but after several emails and them discovering I am out of the country for work, the final resolution was to refund my original amount. *I really needed some over the ear head phones so I ordered these. I charged them fully and tried to connect to the blue tooth,and all they do is connect and disconnect every three to five seconds . They don't even stay connected long enough for me to know what the audio sounds like. I'll be returning these asap since they can't even stay connected to a phone that's 2 feet away."
3553,3,"When I said, ""I hate it"", I don't hate it's sound quality. It's outstanding. But, Mr. Bose, come on! This is my 3rd one, and I am tired and will not BUY another Bose until the wire quality is not improved. I am sorry but when someone buy a earphone for $120+ that person can expect that the thing will be a part of his everyday life and it will last long. I don't expect it to last a lifetime though. I have tried to replace the cable in earlier one but the sound quality was not the same after replacing the cable.I wanted to add photos, but it's not being added."
3554,3,I purchased this product two months ago and today the left earphone is broken. It is not sticking again and all the wires inside are visible and not holding on to my ear and sound is .I am very disappointed with the quality of the product. Didn't expect this from Bose products and expected high quality. I used to use apple earphones before and never had quality issues. The sound was good in bose but it's unfortunate it didn't last for not more than 2 months from purchase. Please send me a new product as it could be covered under warranty. If you want me to return the product please send the return label and I will return them for your verification.
3555,2,"To be fair this is more of a 3 1/2 star review. I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile. I am a Bose fan and have been for several years. I have had several home theater systems, sound wave systems, portable speaker systems, etc. going back several years. I first tried their earbuds a number of years ago and was (to my surprise) disappointed in the sound quality, something I never thought I'd say about a Bose product. The earbuds did not form a good ""seal"" in my ear and let too much ambient noise in causing a less-than-stellar audio experience. I tried them again two more times in recent years and experienced the same thing. I had all but given up on Bose earbuds but decided to give these a shot because I desperately want to like them and hoped that Bose had upped their game. My verdict...""meh."" While better than past versions I still am left disappointed in the lack of bass from a $100 set of earbuds. Not ear-popping, thumping bass, but rich fulfilling lows. I'll probably keep these only because I'm tired of sending them back. I must say that after trying several brands of earbuds nothing compares to Monster's audio sound. Clear highs, rich lows. Too bad their durability is lacking. I will say that I've had a pair of the Monster Achieve wireless earbuds for the past 6 months and, honestly, they are some of the best earbuds I've ever owned...And for nearly 1/2 the price of these wired buds they are a bargain. I also just purchased a pair of Monster Clarity buds at the airport for a recent flight and again, impressed by the audio quality. I use these in the gym without any problems. However, when running outdoors I cannot find a decent pair of wireless buds that hold their bluetooth connection for the duration. Suggestions welcome.UPDATE July 19: It is has been shy of 1 month having used these earbuds, roughly a total of 15 - 5mi outdoor runs in the TX heat. They are done. First sign was when they decided to turn on by themselves randomly at max volume while sitting on the counter while still connected to the iPod (this happened in the middle of the night twice.)... Then the volume would randomly increase to max high then max low while mid-run. Then the static started in the left bud and gradually worsened. The remote is completely responsive now.. I tested on 2 different iPods. Luckily it's within 2 days of return status...Hopefully I can return these without issue."
3556,3,"While it is possible this item was defective, out of the box it did not work with my IPhone X or my friend’s IPhone 6 despite the box explicitly saying that the product was designed to work with IPhones, IPads, and IPods.Using an connection adaptor I plugged this into my IPhone X and after playing for about 1-2 minutes an error box appeared on my IPhone stating it was not compatible with my device. I tried five other connection adaptors and still received the same results an error so it was not the adaptors. Then tried it on my friend’s IPhone 6 with the same results.Tried to make a call with it but it did not work. So no idea about that function.When it did briefly work the sound was slightly above average compared to other brands of in-the-ear earphones I have owned. They are no where near the quality of over the ear headphones. Overall rhey seemed tuned for the middle sound spectrum. The bass as fine but not deep. And the treble and higher pitches were average. The mid-ranges were the clearest and the best. Tried them on rock, rap, classical, and techno music and they were the least impressive with classical and did not provide good bass for the techno.As noted by other reviewers, they do not form a suction to the ear so the “noise canceling” function is not effective or noticeable. Comfort is subjective due to eachnperson’s ear. For me they we quite comfortable for about 20 minutes and then they created a slight pressure. They seemed to hold well in the ear and presumably would have been fine for exercise had they worked.Overall and assuming they work properly they are a slightly above average set of earphones that seems like they could have been decent earphones for exercise provided your music is not in a IPhone."
3557,2,"I bought these to replace an older pair of Bose that I got 5 years ago. The only reason they needed to be replaced is because my dog ate them. That being said, they were amazing. They weren't even the sport edition for working out, but I used them at the gym 5 times a week, getting them sweaty and dirty, but NEVER had an issue. Fast forward to this new pair.....I purchased these 3 months ago and I am already having connection issues. The sounds cuts out constantly and the button functions won't work unless I disconnect the headphones and reconnect. Physically, the headphones are in great shape, you would never know by looking at them that they have almost lost all function. Being that these are the sport headphones, I think they should be able to withstand a little jostling around in my pocket at the gym. The older Bose had a 90 degree angle jack for the headphones, so that could be the issue. I'm not sure, but it's a shame because the sounds quality of Bose products in my opinion is second to none although that all goes out the window if the sound is cutting out the entire time you are using the headphones. My suggestion would be to try bluetooth or try and find the older model of Bose earbuds. Hopefully that helps, I just wish quality would move forward with technology."
3558,3,"This is a small-ish headset, which definitely is NOT over-ear one, but more like ""on the ears"" model, unless you have super tiny ears, or you buy this for your kids.After around an hour of use, I had to stop using them because they gave me so much pain & bruises on both ears and on top of my head as well (see photos). Bluetooth connectivity seemed a bit ""jerky"", and thus the sound wasn't all nice and smooth all the time, but sounded like it was on the edge of dropping, but without really totally dropping though, if you see what I mean.Gave 2 stars since the sound quality was alright, and it comes with a nice storage/transportation pouch and accessories. But that's about all."
3559,1,"You should not be surprised by the price. You definitely get what you pay for. Do not buy these if you think you're buying a cheap pair of headphones with low end. I can't say the sound is bad, but it's almost like you're listening through a tin can. There's not really much bass and it sounds somewhat like you're turning cheap speakers up and putting them next to your ears.For the price, they're fine. I'm going to keep them because we always need an extra set of headphones laying around. but they are just that - cheap, low quality sound."
3560,3,"These headphones have a surprising number of features, but the audio quality is not what I would consider acceptable. The real issue is that the sound is missing mid to high end clarity, which is why my rating was 2 stars. I purchased these mainly for the bluetooth functionality, and they connected to my computer with no issue. It was also impressive being able to tune in FM radio stations with just a few clicks, and the reception was adequate, but not without some static. There is also an SD card slot that I've not tested yet. I appreciate the ambition in the feature set, but I would prefer a better sounding set of bluetooth headphones regardless of any additional features like an SD Card slot and FM radio."
3561,2,"I knew it was too go to be true. Less than 20 hours of use between a couple of tablets and four flights and one side is not working when plugged in. These are being worn by kids 7 and 9 and they thought they were comfortable but alas, so sad when one year stops working. The bluetooth seemed to work pretty easy but having two pair of these in the house caused MASS confusion since they would pair to the wrong tablet. Didn't see that coming. Oh well. Back to plugs and another brand!"
3562,2,"Bought these for my upcoming trips which include long international flights.THE LOOK: The headphones look very nice and comes with a carrying case, usb charger, and aux cord for direct plug in. I suggest being very careful opening and closing them because it's plastic so it might snap without proper care. For reference, I got the teal with white and it's a dark teal color which I really like. Looks cool with the white designed lining.THE SET UP: I unwrapped and plugged it into charge using my laptop. It took about 3 hours to fully charge which is indicated by the red light turning off. Once you turn on the headphones it prompts you that it's ready to pair. Pairing with my mac air was easy. I just turned on the bluetooth feature and opened up the preferences and found ""power locus.""THE FIT/FEEL: I've been wearing it for about an hour now and it almost fits around my ears comfortably. The top of my head feels a bit sore though but it's probably because I'm not used to wearing heavy over the head headphones (personal thing and may not be an issue for others). There is also that same padding on the top of the headband that is around the ears so it helps.SOUND QUALITY: My friend sitting near me (approx 6 feet away) is able to hear my music, especially with heavy bass so if you're in close proximity to others they might be able to hear what you're listening to as well. Sound Quality is decent but I'm having issues with the sound...there's been a consistent stop and go like it's not fully connected. It's been pretty annoying when my music sounds like it's constantly skipping. I tried different songs to see if maybe it was my music but it's not. It shouldn't be a pairing issue since I'm sitting directly in front of my computer with no other electronics to disrupt the signal strength. To test, I also walked to the other room, approx 20-25 feet away before it completely stopped working, then walked back and music resumed.OVERALL: For the price, I would say without the stop and go, it's pretty decent and beautiful. Not sure if that issue will resolve itself but I feel like I might have a defective product. Was really hoping it would've worked out for me considering my nearing trips but, unfortunately, I leave for within the next week so I don't have time to return, process that and wait for another one."
3563,1,"Great price, and initially good, pretty darn good sound, amazing actually, but the charges did NOT hold 30 hrs at all, maybe 12 to 15.And then after a month or so the charging port broke, VERY VERY CHEAP MATERIALS... Probably cost 59Cents to make if not less.DO NOT BUY WHATEVER YOU DO !!!!! Amazon took GREAT care of me OF COURSE and a full refund before I even got off the phone.Now the new units I purchased, yes double the money BUT 1000 times the quality..."
3564,3,"I've been using this product for a few weeks now, I wanted to see how it aged a bit. This product is good looking, and when the cable works its okay sounding. Unfortunately the bluetooth is unreliable even if my phone is in my breast pocket, no more than a foot away from the receiver. The signal is weak, and the sound quality dips and skips frequently. In addition, the charging does not create a consistent battery output, and the controls on the ear piece are extremely loud and clicky in the ear. I want this product to be better than it is, and I really hope I have a defective product."
3565,3,"These worked great....for a week. Sound was awesome. Way better bass and sound quality than the more expensive competitors. I loved the look and feel too. Unfortunately, the entire charging port came out right when trying to charge them! Super disappointing since they were brand new! I registered the product online and filed a notice for them to be replaced by the warranty right away, but months have passed and I haven’t been contacted at all. If I had been able to get a replacement right away, that would have made all the difference but at this point I wouldn’t recommend these at all. Hopefully I get contacted soon about a replacement and I can update my review."
3566,2,"I received these yesterday and today they are going back as defective.I was able to pair them with my Android phone when they arrived, unfortunately the next time I powered them on, even though it said ""pairing"", my device could not ""see"" it. I tried to power off/on, rebooted my phone, and even tried to pair with another device but nothing worked. My opinion, these are too flaky, I will spend more money on something I can count on.Besides the above, here are my observations:PROS:sounds was good, and very loud. I used them for a couple of hours and they were comfortable to wear for that period.CONS:Always defaults to LOUD when powering on.No way to adjust volume on the headset when listening via Bluetooth. you can only control volume from the source. if you try hitting volume controls, it just skips to next track (or previous track when clicking ""down"").Ear cups a little small. I don't think I could wear them for more than 2 hrs at a time.USB charging port feels flimsy.Bottom line: Not worth the 15 bucks I paid."
3567,2,"I used them all of two or three times before they started having issues. Connecting irregularly or not at all even though they were never more than one foot away from my laptop, repeatedly & independently powering off after only a minute of use, frequent skipping on the rare occasion I actually got any audio with them, they never worked with the included aux cord, FM mode never worked, etc. On top of the mechanical issues, they're uncomfortable to wear, uncomfortably heavy, and not flexible at all; it felt like wearing a narrow, weighted bicycle helmet. (Which I would've tolerated if they'd worked better, but they don't.)."
3568,3,"I purchased my first red pair at a box store. They were excellent for the price, and they lasted 6 months with very heavy use. Their design was great, light and fit on the ears perfectly. Sound was definitely beyond this price range. When the left side stopped working, I decided to purchase JVC again since they met the need. My purchase of the black JVC Flats went smoothly. When I opened the blister packaging, both of the ear pieces came apart. The plastic piece that attached the earphones to the headband had sheared. Amazon quickly took them back and replaced them. The replacement came (black again) and this time one of the ear pieces was detached from the headband. The plastic piece was sheared again. This is apparently a design flaw since it was repeated. I would have given these 5 stars for the price and sound, but having two new sets arrive already broken deserves a low ranking. Thanks to Amazon for a painless replacement/return policy."
3569,1,"Got Gorilla tape? You'll need it. After one month they broke in one place and Gorilla tape worked just fine for the fix. 3 weeks later, they broke in a second place; Gorilla tape to the rescue once more. The following week they Broke in a third place and it would have meant trying super glue or gum and a paper clip or some kind of magic spell to repair...but I'm no Macgyver. For the price, the sound is nice enough, but what good is decent sound when you need three hands to hold them to your ears?Pros - They're price point is cheap. The sound is decent.Cons - They're SO cheaply made they fall apart quickly.Waste of money.Totally environmentally unfriendly, as they'll be in a landfill any day now."
3570,1,Headphones are smaller than they look in the picture. Sound is good but I wouldn't call it a noise canceling product. The only problem I have with these headphones is that they slip out of my head when I'm working out. If I lower my head they fall off of my head right away. And they get very sweaty quickly so my ears feel wet during my workouts. Other than that sound is good.8/12: second review a little over a month later. The pad that covers the actual earphone fell off and it is impossible to put it back. I can't use these anymore. Would not recommend this product anymore.
3571,1,"Am revising my review after a replacement pair bought in Dec. 2017 started failing in three months. The wires attaching to the plug on the new ones came loose from the plug just as the earlier ones did, only this time it was a matter of three months instead of three years..Can't recommend. Old review below.Had gotten the wife a pair of these years ago. Won't please audiophiles but they are very comfortable which is what she is concerned with while watching her cat videos. The heavy insulation near the plug came apart, prompting the replacement. The old ones still work, but don't have any electrical tape. Will save it as a spare."
3572,3,"Purchased these to replace the set of blue ones I'd bought that are almost identical but worn down after years of regular use. I like the blue ones a lot, which is why I bought another pair. They're compact and have great sound for headphones so small, plus they're very affordable. But these purple headphones had a spot on one of the ear pads right away when I opened it (first photo), and it started tearing apart within two days of light use (second photo). Sometime around the third day, I had black flakes coming off onto my face and in my hair when I would wear them. So, I just stopped using them and went back to the blue pair. It's otherwise a great product, but I wish the company did better quality control on the fabric."
3573,2,"Sound wise, awesome headphones. Quality is great. Noise cancellation is really more noise mitigation. It clears the lower frequencies, but you can still hear higher pitched sound and louder sounds when its active. The auto detect off ear function is surprisingly useful.After about 6 months using these daily, the battery stopped taking a charge. The included cables do not charge the battery. I also tried changing the cables to see if that was it, but I'm left to conclude that the fault is with the headphones.Incidentally, a co-worker of mine has the exact same model of headphones. He's had his for longer than mine, around a year or more I think, and his also stopped charging. There is probably an issue with the headphones themselves.Conclusion: For the price, I would look for a more reliable brand. 2 out of 2 headphones fail to charge after about a year. If I could, I'd return these."
3574,2,"Worked and still do. Most uncomfortable headphones ever. The cups press on my ears and get really irritating. The constanly cut in and out everytime i move my head (due to the function that allows them to turn off by turning the cups sideways). The sound was descent but not near as good as the Boss i ended up purchasing after these. I really don't know who these are designed for. I have small- normal sized ears if anything and they don't stick out. Do not think these are in the same league as the Bose because they are simply not. This was the second mistake i made looking for in-flight headphones. Just buy the boss if that's what you are looking for. If you are like me, you will end up buying them anyway."
3575,1,"Pros:Great sound. Nice bass.Excellent rechargeable battery life--days and days.Great for phone conversations or music. People I speak with on the phone tell me I sound great.Handy buttons for phone functions and a spring-loaded dial for volume.Much more affordable than similar Bose headphones.Cons:Bulky and heavy. MUCH heavier than Bose.Noise cancelling is pretty good, but not as good as Bose.Shallow earcups (too shallow) that put pressure on your ears and cause some discomfort for extended wear.Earcups have pivoting attachments at the top to attach to the head piece, and they don't pivot enough, so that the top of the ear cups do not rest on your head like they should, which causes more comfort issues.EVERY SINGLE TIME you turn it on, you have to listen to a stupid, cheesy sound effect and a voice that tells you about the battery level and all bluetooth connections. And I swear it waits until you put it on to make all this unwanted noise--you can't turn it on, give it a few seconds and then put it on to avoid it. It really needs a STFU setting or button.EDIT: April 2018My headphones are now almost a year old, and they no longer work very well. Quite often now when I put them on and turn them on, they will cycle thru their power on nonsense (stupid sound effect and announcing charge level and Bluetooth connections) and then seemingly power off or disconnect from everything, and then start over again in an endless loop. It takes several or many attempts of power cycling to get it to stay on. The battery is fully charged. These headphones have been babied through their short life; almost no travel and only used a few times a week in an office environment. There is no reason for them to be so unreliable at less than a year old.Spend the extra money and get the Bose headphones. These will not last and they're just not as comfortable or good as Bose."
3576,3,"Sound quality: excellent, trulyNoise reduction: below average, my old Cowin headphones had equal if not slightly better noise reduction and they cost $60Overall they look good and battery lasts a long time. They turn on and off, pause music randomly and taking them off sometimes pauses the music and sometimes it doesn't.The biggest problem, however, is that after about a month of moderate use (maybe an hour or two per day and only a few times a week) a sound started appearing on the left side, it's a mechanical ""clicking"" sound that appears every time i move my head or try and walk with the headphones. So, oddly, using headphones that ought to make it more quite, I got more noise."
3577,2,"I don't normally like to give a product a 1 star review, but these things just made me angry in so many ways. I'm not sure if I got a lemon or what, as the ANC feature actually introduces noise into the left ear when you turn it on, but I'm not going to risk another ruined afternoon. These go back post haste!An important note about voice prompts and audio feedback.They're often quite cool on a smart speaker sitting across the room. Ludicrous to have piping directly into both ears at point blank range with no ability to disable, attenuate, or bypass.***Imagine if every time you changed channels on your TV it shined a very bright light in your eyes for a few seconds... it's exactly that pleasant - but for the ears.PROS: --- the threshold criteria-Build quality is quite nice. The band and hinges are smooth, and look legit. The rew/play/skip buttons are pretty easy to use. Pairing is fast and simple. Quite comfortable. I did not wear them for very long, but knew I had a good fit as soon as I put them on my head. Price is good for the specifications - if only they delivered on them*. I actually like the style of them, even though they're not popular with many.CONS*: --- Everything you actually bought it to do.-Voice prompts, done in a really low sample rate scratchy sound, accompany almost every single button you can press on this thing. And it it’s not talking at you, it will be beeping at you. You can’t disable them, you can’t turn them down, and you can’t bypass them. There is no escaping the, “Gee whiz we thought voice prompts were cool” bender this headphone designer was on. Too bad they knew so little about designing a pair of music headphones.-The sound is bass heavy, and muddy. Tried it with several different songs, with and without the cord. Of course it’s better with, but then why buy wireless? Controls for the volume are a real pain to operate. It's a recessed ring with very light grip-texture that is almost slippery, and you must twist it using two finger tips to actuate it. Be prepared to frequently skip tracks by accident.-Open mic mode is a great feature on the Sony MWX-1000. Magical really, as it will instantly let you bypass the sound playback and noise cancelling for a quick ""what are they saying on the airport intercom?"" moment, but thanks to the stupid voice prompt on the Plantronics you're losing at least 4 seconds of sound, and with it any chance of hearing what they just said over the intercom. Add to that, the audio quality of the open mic is really poorly processed. Once it is working, it sounds like everything is happening about 8 feet away from you, strangely processed, and echo-laden.-And as for the ANC, quite underwhelming. I know how ANC is supposed to work. Normally good for cancelling droning smooth predictable background noise, not so great at the intermittent noises like barking, people talking, anything arrhythmic is a challenge for the circuitry. So very sad to say that they barely even muffled the sound of the fan in my normal desktop computer.-And, to top it all off, the silly things start producing noise in the left ear as soon as you turn on the Active Noise Cancellation!!! Why on earth would I want a device with ANC that actually adds audible noise to my listening experience?!?! If I turn up the music I can drown out the static, but at that point how do I know if they’re cancelling the noise or just being noisy.I like Plantronics office devices, and it seems like this is where this one came from engineering wise, but I don't even want it in my office. Someone else can have it."
3578,3,"Volume and sound quality lacks completely. I use for my commute to work and you can hear the train chugging along and also hear the doors closing and next stop announcements over the loudest volume setting. The fit gets extremely loose very soon after purchase and just removing or putting on a light practically weightless hood will take them right off of your head. They just do not have any cling to the ear and that kills sound quality and noise canceling. Oh... the battery...... be ready to charge these things daily if you don’t want the low battery announcement in your ear after a few hours of use. Spend twice the money and get a better pair of headphones. My old pair stopped working after years of daily use and I was strapped for cash and hit CNET for some headphone reviews and they recommended these on a budget. I wish I’d have waited a week or so and bought a better pair and not wanted my money on this trash. This review is after roughly 6 months of daily use but the battery issues, sound and fit flaws were a day one issue."
3579,1,"Ordered these as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. She reported that they were great for about a month. She was only using them at her desk (i.e. they didn't undergo a rough daily commute, etc) and one day they suddenly stopped working properly. Now the sound is tinny and they are pretty much unusable. I tried to return them for a replacement but it looks like they stop accepting returns after two months (today is exactly two months after ordering).I did a lot of research before buying these and thought I'd found the perfect pair, but they are too good to be true. I'm disappointed and recommend investing in a higher quality pair of wireless headphones if you're considering these."
3580,1,"Nice weight. Terrible controls for less nimble hands. These seem to want to pair to a phone rather TV bluetooth and always ask to go to phone to check instructions. They don't pair with my TV sending device very well and take a lot of fiddling to get paired. for the price not a bargain. sound is good, although my Mpow set at $35 are much better.***Its now 6 months later (7/2018) and the unit no longer synchronizes with the transmitter: (TaoTronics Bluetooth Transmitter and Receiver, Digital Optical TOSLINK and 3.5mm Wireless Audio Adapter for TV/Home Stereo System - aptX Low Latency). My other much cheaper set of other brand headphones works great.For the cost, this unit is not worth it...Poor controls and terrible synching and now it stopped working..."
3581,1,"The sound quality is surprisingly good, and the the battery life is quite impressive. The material quality is pretty solid, too.But Bluetooth still sucks. Bad. Random disconnects, though it usually immediately reconnects or just beeps at you (both of which are annoying). I use it regularly, and I'm pretty happy with it, but maaan am I hoping good-quality Bluetooth 5 headphones work better (and come out soon).Update: Two months later and the sound just cuts out every few seconds now. Sometimes it will refuse to pair for no reason. This thingis garbage. Save your money."
3582,3,"The left side of the headphones stopped working within a week of purchasing them. It's unfortunate as I was really enjoying these. I was studying and the left speaker simply stopped working. I tried charging, resetting, and disconnecting/reconnecting bluetooth to no avail. I have attempted to contact Jabra but have not received a response.UPDATE 9/8/2018: Jabra contacted me within a day or so of posting this review, see the comment below. I contacted them as requested and went through all the troubleshooting steps. The device did not work. I am attempting to go through the warranty process now."
3583,2,"I bought these headphones so i could play my bass without disturbing people and to play games with (since i already have a standalone mic i don't need an extra one on the headphones). I opened the box once I got them and i only ever heard anything out of the left ear speaker. I tried music on youtube and I tried plugging it into my bass and my amp output jack - nothing from the right ear. There aren't even any buttons, according to the instructions manual. Will be returning these immediately."
3584,3,"I used these headphone primarily for DJing at home, parties, and occasionally clubs, never had the headphone output on my mixer higher than -9db, but one night the headphones just blew out and haven't worked since.... They produce some sound, but it's muffled garbage like a blown speaker sounds. As much as I liked these while using them, a mid range pair f headphones should still last longer than 8 months...I'd recommend you go for something a little more high end that won't fail you after less than a year. Great sound quality for the price, but no durability even if cared for properly..."
3585,2,"I don't know how these got so many good reviews. They are pure trash for 2 reasons:1) the sound quality is horrible. they resemble the quality you would get for cheap dollar store earbuds. my 9 year old logitech g930's sound worlds better than these ""studio"" quality headphones. I cant stress enough how horrible they sound.2) the ear cups are so small they sit on top of your ears. i don't have big ears; they are actually on the smaller size and I couldn't even stuff my ears into these things. they are absolutely unwearable like that and the added pressure from having them sit on your ears gave me a headache within minutes of putting them on. measure your ear length. if its over 1 3/4 inches, your ears will not fit in these cups.Again, I can't believe how highly rated these are. I was truly excited to try them out when I received them, and instantly disappointed. I highly advise against these. even if your ears will fit, the sound quality is just terrible and cheap sounding."
3586,3,"These headphones are not a bad option at their price point for their sound quality. However, the build quality is not up to snuff on my pair. In the first year of owning these, the headphone jack snapped off as shown in the picture. It also bent the jack in my backup moto x. Furthermore, when you try to adjust the bands the metal squeaks heavily and is not pleasant. This is why I am giving these headphones a one star due to the shoddy build quality. While, i am not expecting the build quality of a $500 pair of headphones, I would hope that a company like Audio Technica could prevent these squeaks as well as ensuring the headphone jack remains in tact."
3587,2,"I really wish I liked these more. The brand is one of the top names when it comes to headphones for editing. And the sound quality from these is no exception. The quality is good and you get really good mid ranges and a balanced sound to do your work. The issue is in the build quality. The plastic material these are made of feels cheap and despite how light they are, the headphones feel like they're squeezing my head. the rest on my jaw line and I can't wear them for more than 30 minutes. The chord covering is basic rubber and feels like it will tear any minute. This is a great brand but if you want they're quality items, you're going to have to pay for it. Returning these headphones to search for another."
3588,3,"Despite other reviews, I've had no complaints about people hearing me.Amazingly comfortable, I normally hate wearing headsets, but can wear this one for hours with no discomfort.Fantastic sound (way better than what comes out of my TV). No problems hearing friends at all.However, after less than a year, the cord attaching to my controller developed a short. It will only deliver sound through the headset at one angle, and if I move at all, the sound vanishes and it takes me at least 5 minutes to get it to work again."
3589,3,"I really really enjoyed these headphone when they first came in! They fit very nicely and are by far the comfiest pair of headphones I've worn at this price! I have a pretty large head so if you are like me and we're worried about the fit don't be! You won't be disappointed.My problems haven't occurred until recently. I got these back in January and they have been amazing until recently when I noticed the left side speaker starting to give out. I don't know if this was just my pair or if this is just a normal issue with these. Keep in mind that this was only 2 months after purchase. For the price, the comfort you get can't be beat! If not for the problem I have, this would easily be a five star review!"
3590,2,They felt comfortable but that is the only thing good about these. Didn't have a week before I had to keep unplugging and plugging back into controller due to losing the mic from party. Also a lot of static was heard by others in party when I loved the controller.Waste of money!
3591,2,This is the second time we have purchased this headset w/mic and it is horrible. Both times it has broken within months. I thought it was a fluke but apparently not. This time the cord literally came loose (poor soldering) and so no more mic or volume. Extremely disappointing. The first time the connector broke off....my mistake for buying it again.

3593,3," (Please read entire review before basing opinion)When I recieved this product I immediately started using it since after my last pair broke I had no replacement so I had to use my iPhone without earphones for 2 weeks. At first it seemed like my product was working perfectly fine so I started binge watching YouTube videos to catch-up on most of the videos I missed (mainly asmr videos) however after a few hours I had to unplug my earphones to plug in my charging cable and charge my phone. The next day, I woke up unplugged my iPhone from the charger plugged in my earphones and on my way to school I noticed that the right earphone wasn’t working anymore..I’ve tried to make myself remember if by mistake I may have pulled the lighting jack a little to hard and ruined the product but I’m usually very gentle about this so I don’t think it was my fault however, not being 100% sure, I can’t accuse this product of being faulty. So to be clear this product worked fine like it was supposed to at first but then didn’t."
3594,3,"The EarPods that I received, had average sound quality and were comfortable. However there were two major problems that came with mine. Within the first week of usage I noticed that the volume buttons did not work. While this was a disappointment it wasn’t a dealbreaker so I did not return them. After less than a month of usage, the second major problem occurred when I found that the end of the Lightning cable was corroded.(Photo) The EarPods are now essentially useless, since every time I plug it to my phone I can’t hear anything from them. Overall I’m really disappointed that this product had only one month of real usage."
3595,1,"I bought these after a lot of debating. I read the reviews, which were very mixed. Several of the people also commented on feeling concerned about ordering from this seller, but decided to give it a try with a good outcome. So I thought I would also take the chance. BAD CHOICE on my account! The product LOOKS like a Apple product. The came in the usual Apple box, which was sealed, and was packaged exactly the same. They appear brand new, are clean with no viable damage. HOWEVER...., although I can hear just fine through these earbuds, the person on the other end complained of muffling, breaking up, or not hearing anything at all. All within a space if a minute, with no change in location or position. THESE ARE NOT A AUTHENTIC APPLE PRODUCT. They did not state that they were reburbished either. So even if they were, to sell them as a NEW item and in a sealed APPLE box was misleading! DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER! I don't know where they are getting this product, but it is NOT worth your money or time. It was a waste for me, and now I STILL need to buy another set of earbuds in order to handle my calls. VERY ANGERING and disappointing!! WHATEVER HAPPENED TO COMPANIES (Amazon and others) holding up to the best possible standards and making sure their customers are buying from the best?! As usual..., it's always about the money...., whether it AMAZON, another company, or one of their seller's....., the standards have gone out the window and consumers are on their own."
3596,3,"I want to start off by saying I hardly ever write reviews, unless I think the product is simply so amazing I have to let others know or it was so god awful I hope to steer others away from it. This is a case of the latter. After receiving them, they worked fine for one day and then stopped working. A little background: I ONLY use these headphones at work AT my desk, so there's no chance they fell in water or were stepped on or anything. Here are all the issues I encountered:Could only plug the lightning cord in one way, if you flipped it and inserted it wouldn't recognize the headphones and would play through my iPhone's speakersOne earbud stopped working completelyThe microphone stopped working completelyThe volume would increase and decrease on it's own."
3597,1,"The left ear pod stopped working after just one month of use. I should have listen to the other reviewers. When they were working the sound was great from them. When walking on a treadmill or going for a light run they would bounce out of the ear and would need to be pushed back in all the time. I would not buy these if you are going to do any fast walking or more.Update:So after three tries with the EarPods I finally just received a full refund from Amazon. On all three EarPods the left one stopped working right around after a months time. Two stopped working after the return window with Amazon however the Amazon Product Support Expert I chatted with was great. The first two times they sent me a new pair, and this last time they were still able to provide a refund.Do not buy this product."
3598,2,"If you're a regular runner do not get these shoes. I've run many half marathons and a couple full marathons and continue to run daily. I bought these shoes and was disappointed at how uncomfortable these shoes were all around - I got blisters even after the shoes were worn in and I would compare walking/running in them to walking/running on the actual road, there's little to no support for your ankles and arches. I'm not unhappy with the purchase because I can still wear the shoes but will definitely not be purchasing another pair."
3599,1,"Worst running/walking/workout shoes I have ever worn. The inside of the show is made with a foam that does not breathe. The seams are jagged and if the shoes are worn without socks cause irritation immediately and blisters quickly. They have zero traction, I have slipped many times. They also have virtually no support. After wearing these for four weeks for evening walks my lower back and feet can take no more. I can’t return them but hopefully can warn you against buying them."
3600,3,"I usually don’t leave reviews but this deserved one. First off the “cloudfoam” is definitely a misleading title for the woman’s running shoes, there is no padding whatsoever! They are super tight with no breathing room and I went TWO sizes up! I have small feet and can generally fit into a lot of shoes but damn these were so uncomfortable and this wasn’t even what upset me. What upset me the most was there should be an “open box” or a “recently worn” label. The shoes came dirty with spills and the bottom of the shoes were worn down- they had no traction, someone had some fun with them before returning. At least check the shoes before reselling them or half price it (if even that) for the condition they came in. Not ok."
3601,1,"""I love these cloudfoam shoes from Adidas! They fit perfectly, they’re light, perfect from working out, the tongue is built in so it doesn’t move around while you workout. I highly recommend this pattern as well!""That was my review the day after I bought them. All was fine and well at the gym. After 3 visits to the gym, running on the treadmill for 15 minutes, going 7mph for probably a total of 7 minutes out the 15, and then lifting for 75 minutes, I started to experience severe pain in both of my knees near my MCL. I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just sore muscles from working out. Then started my L ankle pain. It progressively got worse, and eventually I couldn't even walk anymore. I started to assume it was the shoes seeing as there is ZERO support from these shoes. I ended up returning them, and continued to work out wearing different shoes. The damage was done, and things got much much worse. I'm a nurse, so I tried to just ice, take ibuprofen, and rest. That wasn't doing the trick so I went to my nearest urgent care. After 7 x-ray images, I found out I had severe tendinitis and swelling in my L ankle, and both of my knees. Thankfully it wasn't a hairline fracture, which I was thinking it may have been considering how excruciating the pain was. No gym for 2 weeks, ankle wrap, naproxen, rest, and icing was my treatment. Not a fun outcome seeing as I go to the gym 5-6x a week.IN SUMMARY: Do not buy these shoes if you intend to use them at the gym."
3602,3,"These are advertised as the cloudfoam, they even say it on the sides, but they're definitely not. They're just regular memory foam and I can definitely tell the difference between them and my blue pair. They even say different things inside. The black pair I bought here says Adidas memory foam. The blue pair I bought in the store said Adidas cloud foam. The black pair feels tight on my feet and offers no real support. The blue pair fits great and I love walking around in them. How is this possible when they're supposed to be the same shoes in different colors? I got the black ones for easy workout shoes and I hate wearing them. I wore them to work one where I stand up all day and oh boy, did I regret that."
3603,1,"SHOE IS VERY COMFORTABLE, WHICH IS WHY I PURCHASE, I HAVE HAD AT LEAST A DOZEN PAIR OF SKECHERS FLIP FLOPS AND TENNIS SHOES IN PAST. I HAVE ONLY RETURNED ONE PAIR OF FLIP FLOPS DUE TO DISCOMFORT. I WAS FIRST ANNOYED BECAUSE THE TONGUE OF BOTH SHOES SLIP TO THE SLIDE WHICH IS CAUSED BY THE FABRIC OF THE TONGUE. I STARTED WEARING SHOES TO GYM ONLY, AFTER 9/24/18(RECEIVED DATE), ON 11/19/18 I NOTICED THAT THE SHOE HAD RIPPED, IT IS TO LATE TO RETURN SHOES, I AM NOT ROUGH ON SHOES. I WILL NO LONGER PURCHASE SKECHERS FOR THE GYM OR TO WALK IN. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED, I WONDER IF THE FABRIC WAS DRY ROTTED. IT WAS TOO LATE TO CONTACT SELLER WHEN SHOE RIPPED, I ATTEMPTED TO TRY TO FIND AWAY TO CONTACT SKECHERS THROUGH AMAZON, BUT I CAN'T FIND AWAY. SKECHERS SHOULD KNOW THAT THEIR SHOES LASTED LESS THAN 2 MONTHS WITH MINIMAL WEAR. I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH MOST OF MY PURCHASES FROM AMAZON, BUT THE SKECHERS ARE A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT..."
3604,1,"I have a pair of these Sketchers in size 10. I have a bunion on my right foot and have cut out that side, so it's not painful and fits perfectly otherwise.Saw this shoe, advertising extra wide width.It is exactly the same as my original pair. The box says extra wide, it isn't. Tried them on, started pinching on the right side after a few minutes.I compared my shoes with theirs. Exactly the same...or so close it's irrelevant.Sent back the first pair, ordered a second, thinking it was a mistake.Same size again. Sent both back.Buyer beware."
3605,3,"I purchased these shoes in solid white. They fit as expected, and I wore them only for work as a hospital pharmacy tech. They were pretty comfortable in the beginning, but the memory foam insoles thinned out quickly. I replaced them with different inserts just over a week after getting them. Unfortunately, I didn't even get a month out of them before they split down the side. Thankfully Amazon was awesome and refunded me, because $45 is too much for shoes that last less than a month. I have to say that I've been more and more disappointed with the Skechers brand, and I can confidently say I'm done buying them."
3606,2,"I bought this shoe in March 2017 to replace my worn out Sketchers (similar style) that I wore daily for over a year. I ordered my size, 11 wide width. I did not begin to wear the shoes until June and found them to fit a little large, but not so much so a return was warranted. To my disbelief, both shoes came apart in September 2017. The left shoe came apart around the toe and side and the right shoe started to come apart along the side. Of course, no returns are allowed after this amount of time, I am now out the money and a good pair of daily shoes. Be sure not to wait to wear the shoes."
3607,1,Most UNcomfortable shoes EVER! I am a SOLID size 8 in shoes. I loved them at first 'step'.......it was 1-2 hours into wearing them that areas all over the bottom of my feet would go completely numb and/or hurt. Also.....it looks like it's missing a shoelace hole that secures the ankle better. I loosened the shoelaces to make it better on the pads of my feet....but then it didn't hold me in the shoe. If you are buying these just to look cute (which they are and Sketchers provides 2 sets of laces black&white which I loved) then great! If you are buying them to be active in them....I would not recommend.....
3608,1,"I've owned a multitude of TOMS, currently I own 6 pairs of varying styles. This particular style, I've owned 5 of in the past, and this is the first time they've ever not fit me like a glove right out of the box. And no pair of TOMS has ever given me a blister, but boy, these sure did! I ordered them right before the weather got cold, and wasn't able to start wearing them till recently - and man am I bummed. Too late to return, so, bad review instead. I just wasted all that moneys, and now what do I do? Sell knock-offs on ebay as real TOMS and screw another poor soul over? Nope, just stuck with crappy shoes. UGH.So here's my problem:- Too tight on the top of the foot, rubs really badly on the inside of each foot. (Blister town)- Too loose in the back, they don't even stay on my feet, it's like wearing flip-flops.- Just not nearly as comfortable as real TOMS.Sigh. Maybe I can wear them for yard work.... waste of good money."
3609,1,"These are FAKE! I have real TOMS which I purchased from the actual TOMS website and I compared a few things. First, the sizing was WAY off. I wear a 7.5 in real TOMS and could barely squeeze my feet into these. Second, there was visible glue hanging out between the canvas and soles of the shoes. Authentic TOMS would never have glue hanging out like that. Third, the stitching was wide, uneven and coming apart. Finally, if you look inside the shoe where your heel should lie, it says TOMS with a ™ sign following, real TOMS have TOMS and the ® sign following. These are clearly fake and Amazon has accepted my request to return. It baffles me as to how this seller is allowed to continue selling these fakes to thousands of people and Amazon is is doing nothing to stop it."
3610,3,"I ordered a mens size 8 (M8) which is documented on my order. They sent me a women's size 8 (W8) and these M8 and W8 abbreviations are viewable on the soles of the shoe. They're incredibly small and do not fit a mens foot, obviously, as far as the width goes. After contacting them, I was told that I was allowed to return them yet I'd be responsible for a shipping cost in addition to finding my own box that's able to fit the shoe box as well - which I just don't have. It was delivered in a package that you easily rip apart. I had no reason to think that they would get wrong the EASIEST part of the order - delivering the correct item. It's one of those ""you had one job"" moments. Now I'm stuck needing to figure it out because I do not financially have money to throw down the toilet. I needed new shoes and that is not what I got.Considering the amount of options and patterns, I really thought, ""Wow, these aren't very expensive and I can see myself ordering multiple pairs in the future."" After receiving the wrong pair, I even considered ordering another pair in a M8 instead, and also a new pair of black ones as mine are getting old, then realized how incredibly stupid that would be considering the most simple detail of the transaction was unable to be done correctly. In regards to the business aspect, this is a great example of how to lose it - and how even the smallest mistake will effect your bottom line."
3611,3,"I love the look of these shoes, but the quality is absolutely terrible. These shoes squeak like crazy and it's really obnoxious. I have two pairs, unfortunately, because I thought they would last. One is a 13 and one is a 12 (in black) as I am right in between sizes. Therefore, I can rule out it being a 'fit' issue. It's definitely the shoe. Additionally, I've worn these maybe 7 times and had them for just over a month and the material is already tearing. It'll be another couple of wears before they are complete trash. The seller should do the right thing and replace them."
3612,1,"I have never even owned a pair of Toms, yet I could tell immediately that these are fake. The insoles are not sewn in, they pull right out. As a matter of fact, turn the shoes upside down and they’ll just fall out on their own. There’s also no pattern on the inside of the shoe (I’ve read that no pattern is a sign of fakes). Overall, the shoes just have an extremely flimsy, cheap feel to them. Yes, I realize what Toms are and what they are made of, but these have dollar store slipper quality. Do not buy these. Just go directly to Toms website and pay a few dollars more. Returning these flea market specials."
3613,2,"These tennis are super cute & that's why they get the 2 stars but they're VERY uncomfortable, they are definitely NOT workout shoe. I thought New Balance tennis were all supposed to be super comfortable & supportive, sadly these are not. I'm wondering if these are counterfeit?! I bought to wear to the gym but I feel that they are too loose even when double knotting the laces, my foot feels like it wants to slip out when doing lunges at the gym. I bought the right size but shoe may be a bit wide? I can't quite pin point the problem other than them not being comfortable There's not much support inside either, the cushion is low to the ground & while wearing these my feet sort of feel like I'm wearing the left shoe on the right foot & vice versa. I've never had this experience with any other tennis shoes & that's why I wonder if they're counterfeit. I really had high expectations for these shoes especially since they weren't cheap. I wish I could return them but can't sadly because I've worn them a couple of times I don't believe I can. I'd only buy if you're only going to wear on occasion & not to workout in or if you're going to be doing a lot of walking."
3614,2,"This was my first time trying out New Balance. I LOVED these shoes when they arrived!! For the first two weeks they were my favorite shoes of all time. Comfier than any Nikes or other shoes I had worn, & oh so cute! I loved how light weight they were, too.However, they only lasted two months. TWO MONTHS! Their sole has already lifted up & is all wonky & junky. The memory foam is VERY short lived, & after a short time it is no longer supportive or cozy in any way. Also, the material is all stained, & despite my best efforts, does not clean well. I will never buy a New Balance shoe again. Severely disappointed! At least my Nikes lasted me a whole year of daily wear."
3615,2,"These shoes are so cute, but sadly they are way too narrow. Normally New Balance seems so run wide, like my feet, so a couple of months back I had purchased these in grey. I mostly just wore them to work at first and didn’t notice anything, but after walking around in them for long periods of time my feet would hurt a little. Then, after running in them my feet got blistered where the insole meets the inner side wall of the shoe because of how narrow the insole was. By this point I’d worn the shoes too many times to return/exchange them so I bought them in a wide size... even in a wide size the insole was WAY too narrow for my foot. I didn’t get a chance to run or even really walk around in the wides because I’m returning them. I could feel the meeting point between sidewall and insole slightly pinching the sole of my foot just from trying them on. It should be noted my feet run a bit wide but I’ve never really needed to purchase a wide size shoe before :( so bummed out because I love the look and feel of these shoes.Bottom line, if you have a very narrow foot these shoes will be awesome! If you have feet that even run the slightest bit wide, JUST SAY NO."
3616,3,"4/4 UPDATE - 2 weeks in.... sole is coming apart... worn only indoors at the gym. I'm going to contact the seller to see if they can replace it, maybe this was just a fluke. Still love these shoes and really hope this is an isolated issue.Original Review Below:Love these shoes! I’ve been actively going to a cross-training fitness class 4/5 times a week for about 5 months now and was in dire need of a replacement for my running shoes, but not ready to spend a fortune on cross trainers.I’ve had these for about a week now, and so far very happy. These provide much more support for this style of workout, and my foot/ankle feel far more stable performing the different excersizes and movements. So far they seem like a great choice and I’m very happy with the price.I’ll provide an update if anything changes as I use them more."
3617,3,"I love New Balance and I've worn them for years with no problems. I ordered these sneakers and wore them about a half a dozen times just to run errands. I hardly put any miles on them and certainly didn't use them for heavy exercise or running. 4 1/2 weeks in I noticed one of the sneakers developed a hold on the side seam and started to fall apart! In addition to that, a tiny hole was beginning to develop on the bottom of the shoe, too. I don't know why this happened and I'm going to give New Balance another chance, but I wouldn't recommend this shoe at all. My past ones have lasted me years, these only a month. It's sad, too, because they are super stylish and very comfortable."
3618,3,"I was trying to find a running shoe with arch support but these have absolutely none, as they are all fashion and no function. The footbed is hard and flat as a board (see pics). If anything they make your foot overpronate because the inside arc of the outer shoe is fashionably carved out. They are cute but I would mess up my feet pretty bad running in these. Mine also came with a perforation in the toe area so I’ll probably end up returning. Not the quality of “running shoe” one would expect after dropping $80."
3619,3,"I bought these because I needed gloves during my morning walks in Winter. I read in the reviews that they kept hands warm in lower temperatures and I liked the fact that they were not so bulky as other gloves.But these really do not keep hands warm in lower temperatures. The first time I used them the temperature was 28 degrees but it wasn't windy. Even then my hands felt cold in these. I cannot imagine how these are called ""runners gloves"" because at any speed faster than a walk the air would go straight into these and make your hands cold. They may keep hands in the 40s or 50s but nothing lower than that.The good thing about thrm is that they are true to size and have a close fit to the hand for maximum dexterity. Also they work well with smartphone screens (I can easily text in these).But you can definitely find a similar pair of gloves at a lower price. These are too expensive and not really worth it."
3620,3,"i’m super disappointed. these shoes are very narrow and small. my shoe size is an 8.5, always dead on, and so i ordered an 8.5 and unfortunately they were too small and tight. there was also a ridge on the instep sean (right under the arch) and it was really uncomfortable to walk on. i submitted a return. if you have narrow feet, order a half size up and these will probably work fine for you. they were awful for me.the design is darling (i ordered the black with rose gold detail) and i sooo wish they’d worked for me. looks just like the image. arrived on time as well, just terribly sized.also - i went to a local dsw and found this same shoe (same price) and tried it on in a 9 just for kicks.. the toe area was more acceptable, however there was still an uncomfortable ridge on the instep."
3621,3,"While I absolutely love the way these gloves fit and the way they look (they are really pretty on) the touchscreen feature (which is why I bought them) only works about 30% of the time. Its extremely frustrating because I already have really pretty gloves! I wish the touchscreen feature worked better. May be to late to return but if not, I will.I’m updating my review. Taking it from a 3 Star to a 1 Star. Initially I said the touchscreen feature works about 30%, I was guessing. I’ve paid better attention and it works about 10% or less. This is why I purchased these gloves and it does not work. Very Disappointed."
3622,2,The gloves seem to be cut wrong. The medium was to small. The large didn't seem to be correctly proportioned. The thumb was very long so I couldn't use it on my phone. My other fingers fit fine but the gloves were constantly moving on my hands. They kept slowly sliding down my hands while I walked. I had to tuck them in my jacket sleeves and tighten my jacket wrist straps. The material was soft but they didn't keep my hands warm in 30 degree weather. I can't recommend these.
3623,2,"Very bulky and thick. There is a plastic he'll gaurd sewn into the interior of the shoe that as soon as I put on irritated my side heel. After wearing around the house for a few minutes I noticed it was rubbing my side heel even worse, almost leaving a blister like feel. Once I investigated, I found out it really is sticking out pretty far. Am returning and buying a different brand. They are very uncomfortable, very bulky shoe. Which is odd for a running shoe, I like thin and these are really bulky and very thick bottoms. Makes me almost 2"" taller. Which is something I was hoping it wouldn't have (a super thick sole) but it does . All in all I am not happy at all, haven't even had them 10minutes and already sending back. Keep looking aound, pass these up."
3624,1,"These are among the worst running shoes I've ever used. There is a lump in the sole of the right shoe which is not uncomfortable at first but which forces one to run in a slightly lopsided manner which ruins one's form and causes pain. I imagine that this is a quality control problem, not an issue with every pair of shoes they make, but the result has been that these shoes are completely useless. I went running with them once (for less than thirty minutes) and my right ankle and hip already hurt. Can not recommend."
3625,2,"I have worn Saucony athletic shoes off and on for years, and been pleased with them. However, I found these to have a very stiff and non-cushioned sole in comparison to may last pair, which are several years old. I always have 2 pair of running shoes, which I alternate wearing, so my feet get a ""break"" from the same position & structure day in and day out. I returned these because they were not adequately cushioned and felt very stiff. However, my feet themselves have very little cushioning of their own, and I wear a custom orthotic for extremely high arches.Since returning these, I ordered 2 different Saucony shoes from another online retailer. They were better cushioned, but did not fit well, so I am back to square one. My plan is to shop at a traditional specialty retailer, such as Fleet Feet, where I can try several brands and models in one day!"
3626,3,"LOVE LOVE LOVE.**5/26/18 UPDATE**Today is a sad day. I realized today these shoes have already lived to their full potential and are moving on to bigger and better things I guess. After walking around the past few days shopping, they decided to stop being supportive and actually hurt. I had to buy a $.99 pair of flipflops at Walmart to relieve the pressure these started causing. It's too bad. They were so good and I really did love them - while they lasted. But to me, 4 months for shoes isn't a good thing. Unfortunately, I had already bought my husband a pair of them and he immediately hated them. I should have trusted his instinct lol. These are good if you are looking for a weekend hike a few times, but don't invest a lot since they won't last."
3627,3,"My last 6 pairs of running shoes have been Saucony Cohesion. I run >20 miles/week, and they are the first brand of running shoes I found that are light but also offer great support for my overpronation. Plus they are far less expensive than bigger brand running shoes that don't offer as much support.HOWEVER, something changed with the new Cohesion 10 shoes. They have way less support than previous versions of the Cohesion. As soon as a slid my foot in I could tell the shape of the shoe was different. It is not as contoured to the foot. The insoles feel flat, whereas previous versions had a defined arch.When I wear these for runs, they feel like shoes that are ready for retirement. I have sensitive feet and legs that are prone to stress fractures, and can instantly tell when a shoe is too worn and will start straining my legs. These felt like that from the start. I hope 11 improves, or I will have to go back to past models."
3628,3,"I will be contacting Amazon about a replacement. After using a different brand for the past few years, I felt pushed into buying the all famous Nfinity that my daughter wanted and everyone claims as better and lightweight. The shoes arrived today and I am highly disappointed (not to mention the tears from my daughter who was expecting to wear them tomorrow). Both shoes have brown stains that are sticky on the inside of the shoe like glue near the toe. The stitching for the foot pad in the shoe looks good around the heel and as you go towards the tow, the stitches become wide in length and spacing. They don't look right, more like knock-offs after talking to several parents with children who have the Nfinity Vengeance shoe. There is also something sticky (like a price sticker glue) over the Nfinity name on the tongue of one shoe. These shoes look terrible, and for $90, insane. Hopefully Amazon will make the replacement process easy and I will update this review when the new shoes arrive."
3629,3,"this product is light weight...my daughter loves these shoes...she is a power tumbler ...i am very disappointed in them....i bought these shoes in April right before Worlds...she only broke them in and only used them for Worlds..by June she already had holes in the sole..no she did not wear them outside she only wore them in the gym or on the competition floor..I am extremely disappointed in this product because I was told from Nfinity representative that they will last a season...but they didn't...and after contacting Nfinity I was basically told ""too bad""...but my daughter loves them and yes i will have to buy another pair...I am hoping this pair will last longer than a couple of months."
3630,2,"My freshman varsity cheerleader is not a fan of these shoes at all. First, the gray lines through them actually make them look dirty before they are even worn. It only gets worse after a few wears. The length runs small, and the width is wider than most cheer shoes. My daughter has wider feet, and still has to cinch up the laces to the point that they look ridiculous when on just to keep her shoes on.We bought a pair of Chasse for $13 last year, and my daughter would prefer to wear those over the Nfinity pair. There is no real support in these shoes at all, which isn't good for the bases as all. If our cheer squad did not make these shoes mandatory, we would not purchase them again."
3631,1,"My daughter loved these shoes when she first got them because they are light weight. She only wears the shoes indoors for competitive cheerleading. The shoes are literally falling apart. Two cheerleaders from her squad had the same problem with their shoes. They were able to return them to the sports store that they purchased them from for new shoes. Unfortunately, I can not return the shoes that I bought on Amazon. Do not buy these shoes. I am not happy that I paid $90 for a pair of cheer shoes that will not last one-fourth of the cheer season."
3632,3,We have purchased annually for the last 4 cheer seasons however this years pair were defective. After one indoor practice the sole started coming apart and the toes started to become unglued. I came back to Amazon to double check the order because I felt that perhaps these were fake. I now see that they were actually sold by Amazon so I assuming we got a defective pair. I see others have recently had the same issue so im worried that something overall has changed with the shoe. I am simply not paying $100 for a cheer shoe that starts to fall apart after a single 2 hour practice though.
3633,3,"The quality of the show is insanely cheap the material isn’t good not only that but you can take the cushion off. for some reason rather easily and underneath is all raw “Pipe work” if you can call it that. Only reason I’m giving it 3 Stars is because it’s a shoe and it does what’s it’s designed to do. Put it on your feet and walk with them. Works there wouldn’t be surprised if they start falling apart after a month. There are better shoes out their for this price, but I’m just to lazy to return them."
3634,2,"Fits slightly smaller than expected. Material feels cheap, though so was the price. The real reason I give the product such a low score is due to the fact that the left shoe was lopsided. Wore them for two days and it was enough that my knee and ankle started to hurt. Won't be wearing these shoes again, a waste of my money.I give it two stars instead of one because, had they not shipped me a lopsided shoe, I think these might have made a reasonable pair of comfortable, cheap shoes. At least for a bit, I'm not confident that they would hold up in the long term."
3635,3,"They're smaller than expected. They are about as expected length/width-wise but the roof of the shoe (I don't know what it's called.. where the laces are) is much lower than is typical of shoes this size so the span of the laces is considerably wider while worn.They are also more white, less grey than the image shows.I still generally like ... or.. don't dislike them. They're cheap shoes and don't weigh very much and that's about all they have to do."
3636,1,"Oh my heck.... the WORST PURCHASE I made all year and i do alot of online shopping . The shoes came late for christmas, when opening the plastic bag they came in i thought this must be the wrong order... nope. They are made of the cheapest rubber crap you get when you buy littlw kid water shoes. They have no padding or sole inside. My husband tried them on and the glue is already pulling apart on the sides. The color is awful mostly because they are supposed to be grey ... they are white. But turn a grey when uou wear black socks under them from the material being so thin on top .. made so cheap im embarrassed for the people selling them. I would never buy these shoes for $5.. much less $25! Ill be returning these."
3637,2,"I gave a three star review because while I got to wear the shoe I extremely enjoyed how it fit and was very comfortable, not to mention it looked great but unfortunately after wearing the shoe only two times it broke. The small clasps that hold the lace broke casing them to be unable to be tied. I would recommend the shoe if you don't tie your shoes extremely tight like i do, but if you do tie your shoes very tight then I would probably steer clear."
3638,3,"I wanted to like these so badly! I wear a 9.5-10 so I ordered the 10 and they were quite loose and had about a 1/2 an inch of space in the toe. They're very lightweight, which is nice, but the ankle cuts up so high, and is so itchy, I couldn't wear them for more than a couple minutes! They're cute, but I just think it's unfortunate that the design cuts so high and is so uncomfortable. Wish they would have worked, but they just didn't work for me."
3639,3,"These just arrived today. The color leans more towards a violet than a purple, and it has silver threads woven into the fabric, they are a super cute, inexpensive pair of sneakers, nothing to rave about. The downside; they have the bare minimum of cushion inside. I attached pictures so you can see what I’m describing. It appears to have arch support but if you notice, the stitching only curves which gives the illusion of arch support (middle pic). These shoes are completely flat inside. I paid $22.99 obviously, I don’t plan to, or expected to be able to go runnning or do an entire day of walking in them. I think they will look really cute with my jeans and LSU tee-shirt on weekends. I will update later on their durability."
3640,3,"These shoes ran large on me, and I'm always a true size 8. That's the main reason I returned them. They weren't necessarily too long, but definitely on the wide side. The pink fabric has flecks of gold throughout which I didn't expect. I wasn't sure how I liked it, but after a while I thought it was fine for ""fashion"" athlesiure shoes. I wanted these just to run around in, not for workouts.You definitely won't be able to use these shoes for heavy workouts like running, but they'd be fine for walking and just kicking around. The soles didn't seem like rubber, but more like styrofoam. Kind of strange, but very lightweight, though! I also thought the bottoms were really slick -- walking on a tile floor in my house was a little slippery -- not a good grip on the bottoms.Bottom line - if you're looking for inexpensive athleisure shoes these would be fine, but they ran larger on me."
3641,1,"Like many before me, I ignored the reviews about the golden glitter because I'm a darn fool. Friends, it looks like a pink and gold striped glittery shoe. I spent an hour trying to get a picture of them to prove how but it doesn't show up on camera. The pink looks much more subtle in pictures too but nope, you are walking around with bright, glittery shoes.I also don't like tennis shoes that make my feet look big (ya know what i'm saying) and these will do that to you hardcore.I returned them and found some cheaper and nicer ones elsewhere, thats my recommendation to you."
3642,2,"I really wanted to love these. They are super cute, I bought the grey with gold. Unfortunately the material of the sole is a foam type of material, which is quite slippery on any smooth surface. I sprayed some hairspray on the bottoms, to add a bit of tackiness. Not sure how well that will work if they get wet (hopefully won't make them even more slick LOL), but it is helping for now. Also, the top, back of the sneaker sort of digs into the back of my ankle, so I wouldn't wear these for long walks. The sizing is accurate, I normally wear a women's US 11, ordered the 11, and they fit perfect. I will keep them since they were inexpensive, and wear them to work since I sit most of the day. Won't be purchasing again."
3643,3,"I ordered these shoes for a trip and wore them a couple of time around the house prior to my trip. I wore them for about 6 hours on the trip and the widths is just not wide enough for my feet. I love the shoes, but cannot wear them and the return date has expired. Also from what I can tell these shoes do not come in wide widths. Pleas let me know what options are available to me for a return. Thank you."
3644,1,"I was excited for these shoes until I opened the box, I got so angry!!! If you look at the photos you can obviously see that one shoe looks older than the other — from the shoe color to shoelace and even the sole , they are all a different shades! The material is even scratched up. AND the “Rose Dust” color does not even match what’s in the picture. Returning."
3645,3,"These just weren’t for me. They look like great shoes and with all shoes it depends On Your feet. I do not have a technically wide foot but it is not narrow either. The widest part of my foot was getting pinched so I returned them. They didn’t seem to be narrow shoes but something about the way they are made just pinched my foot. They also seemed a little big length wise but that may be the sizing. I wear an 8 and these are said to be 8-8.5 American size but I would call them an 8.5. Of course socks could make a difference. I tried them with running socks, but if you are a typical 8 and plan to wear thick socks they might not slip. I would definitely suggest if you are interested but not sure about these that you use prime wardrobe so if they don’t work you can return for free."
3646,1,For the amount of money I paid for these shoes they were not as described nor was the quality! If I could give BEN a zero star I would ! I had to send them back to get a bigger size and they still felt tight. I wore them to break them in and they squeaked so much! I tried all the tricks to stop it and it just wouldn’t let up! So embarrassing walking around the hospital making so much noise. When I got home to look at the shoes they already had water stains on them! Only after 12 hours of being worn! A complete waste of my money and totally not worth the buy in my eyes. I’m upset that I spent 160+ on something that didn’t even do half the job it was described to. Poor quality and poor choice on my part.
3647,3,"OMG ya'll, where to even begin. I don't know if I just got a defective shoe or if this is typical of ECCO, but the quality is severely lacking. I'd be upset if a shoe half this price had all these issues. I'm just going to make a list for ease of reading.CONS1) Small holes in the rubber sole. Lots of them. Never have I seen such a thing. I'm going to guess when the sole was molded tiny air bubbles were present, creating this swiss cheese disaster.2) Very obvious seams on the front and back of the rubber sole. I was so baffled by this I thought I was the crazy one, and maybe all my sneakers have seams and I just never noticed. So I checked and no. This is just shoddy craftsmanship.3) The edges of the leather weren't smooth and looked worn.4) Scuff marks. Only one is visible in the pictures (on the heel) but there were a few more that just didn't show up well when photographed.5) The white leather has a greyish look to it, and the laces are beige, not white. They are also weirdly stiff.6) On the inside of the shoe, you can see the green underside of the insole. To be honest, I probably wouldn't have cared about that if it wasn't on top of all these other bizarre issues.Basically, this shoe was just one giant cluster----. But on a positive note, the leather was very soft and it was actually pretty comfortable. Ha."
3648,2,"The first problem is the sizing of these shoes. I wear a mens size 9.5 M, I ordered a mens 10 M expecting to get a little extra room. What I got instead was a shoe that was more in line with a size 7 narrow. I could not even fit my toes in the opening. The shoe is clearly stamped 10M, definitely a mis-sizing. The other problem had to do with the quality of the shoe's upper part. The canvas used is very thin and flimsy feeling. Also the seams were all ragged and unfinished on the inside. I returned them immediately and will not be considering Vans in the future. A total disappointment."
3649,3,"The color was not as expected and it seems like Vans changed their product because I've been wearing this model for some years now, bought a few pairs of it throughout the years always the same size, and now the shoe is much harder to put on so it feels smaller, but then after it's on, the foot moves around in the shoe. A smaller size just won't go on because the opening is too narrow.Returned the shoe and went to the store to try on a few more pairs and had the same problem. The salesperson said they're getting a lot of similar complaints lately.I loved my Vans and i hope they fix up the model."
3650,3,"order a half size up though, my heels will slip out of the back. So, while the length of the shoe is true, the space between the insole and upper only allows for a pancake thin foot! If these are the only shoes someone wears, it's probably because their grossly misshapen feet won't fit into normal shoes!That being said, I did receive my shipment quickly. The sizing on this page was very misleading, but I looked at shoezoo's website to make sure the size I ordered would be the size I received (they were the vendor that came up when I chose my size from the drop down). I only wish they offered free returns."
3651,1,"Huge Disappointment! My daughter has been patiently waiting for school time to get these, she is a HUGE Zelda fan. She wears a size 4 so we ordered a 4 and they were way too small. So we returned them and got a 4.5 and even though those were 4 inches longer than her actual foot, they STILL would not fit! These shoes are SO narrow. I'VE NEVER had such a problem with Vans being that narrow...maybe because these were leather, but regardless ahe is devastated thatbthey did not fit. And now I can't find the canvas ones in her aize at all. Why are these soo narrow?? Why cant Vans make a wide version of each size like every other shoe company. Either way, these were more narrow than any shoe I've ever seen. She doesn't even wear a ""wide"" normally...shes 10 years old. Well now she is a very sad 10 year old!! Thanks Vans!"
3652,2,"I have no idea what people see in these shoes. They seem alright at first, but they're basically just covered flip-flops, and you can walk about as far in them, which is to say barely at all. But at least flip-flops are good for the beach; these are just a flimsy and uncomfortable pair of shoes. Don't do it. Don't make your feet uncomfortable and give yourself blisters just because they look good. Get a real pair of sneakers that you can wear and do whatever you want in without ever having to worry about your feet. I regret this purchase and regret that in order to come to this conclusion I've already worn them outside too much to return them. I can't even decide whether I should put these in a donation bin or just throw them out, since I'm not sure that I want to inflict them on a needy person. 0 stars."
3653,1,"If you're reading reviews or looking at pictures considering these shoes, don't. I bought these shoes a year ago, and beat them up pretty good, so I literally reordered the same pair as last time. First thing that was weird with my 2nd order was these are no longer Prime. Okay, fine. Then a little while after I order I realize these are coming direst from China. Okay... sure. Maybe they were backordered or something. Whatever, no big deal, I'll wait. A month later, what is pictured shows up and YEAH not even close to being the same quality let alone the same shoe! The actual marketing pictures of the Clay Nubuck shoe are what I received the first time. This 2nd order is NOT EVEN CLOSE. Color is different, grey not clay/beige in the slightest. The material is so, so thin on the top, it should be embarrassing. They're way too small and very narrow. The piping around the edge is not even the same color as the rest of the shoe. And there is this thin sheeting on the inside that without even trying the shoe on, was peeling and not secured. Utterly inexcusable quality. I highly recommend finding a different shoe vendor to purchase from. And shame on Amazon for letting this stuff slide."
3654,2,"I bought a pair of these a couple weeks ago. They're comfy and the fit is just right...LOVE THEM! I loved them so much, that I ordered another pair, same size, but different color. I got them yesterday...they're disappointingly huge! I verified the size on the box AND on the shoe itself. When I compared the previous purchase and the new purchase side-by-side, the new pair is at least a half size larger.If you're re-ordering a product, you should be able to trust that the sizing, particularly a shoe, is consistent. I'll definitely be returning, but now a little hesitant to order another pair...bummer."
3655,3,"These are going back! I was so excited to get these but when I opened the box I was super disappointed :(They look super shiny and cheap, they are VERY POINTY which isn’t reflected in the picture and in my opionion look like they came from a dollar store. They look like elf shoes.Even if I’d liked them they’d have to go back, I ordered a size 8 and received a size 8 1/2. Normally that’s something you could fix with thick socks, but these shoes are so huge that they would fall right off my feet even if I wore four pairs of socks.... Definitely size down! I added a picture of the shoe next to my foot so you can see how much bigger it is."
3656,1,"I live in Minnesota and bought these in March while snow was on the ground so only recently got to wear them - outside of the return window. Within an hour on my feet, the elastic that alkows the shoe to slip on and then stay on your foot had become detached on one side. Yes, the shoe fell apart right away. I tried to communicate to the company and they basically said take it up with Amazon. Would not recommend these shoes!!!! I guess you get what you pay for - so lesson learned. Learn from me, buy a higher quality item that will last longer."
3657,3,"I have only worn these once so far but the memory foam is quite comfortable and it's a cute shoe. I did have to exchange these though. I originally ordered an 8, my usual size, but needed to go down to a 7.5. The 8 wasn't too wide but it was too long and slipped off of my heel. The 7.5 is perfect now. I chose the neutral gray color which will work beautifully with many of my casual outfits.These shoes are cute but now that I’ve worn them a bit I’m incredibly disappointed. They stretched out pretty quickly after I wore them for a few hours and now they are way too big. I’m really disappointed because they’re so cute. I should have sized down from he original 8 to a 7, not 7.5. Possibly even a 6.5."
3658,3,"I have been disappointed by very few products that i have ordered from Amazon. If everything were this upsetting, I would not have ordered so many items. However I don’t blame Amazon. It’s Reebok I am upset with. I have worn ONLY Princess and Classic Leather for longer than I can remember. They have been the only shoe styles that have been comfortable for my aching feet. I have always worn 7 1/2 and 7 1/2 wide D. Since they were leather, they fit wonderfully. The cut has been perfect and they have been very comfortable from the time I first put them on. Any snug areas, as around my bunions, stretched to fit quickly. They have never hurt, and new Reebok’s always made me happy. when I saw they were available through Amazon, I quickly ordered a pair of each, intending to buy 4 more pair soon. Never would have thought they are not the Reebok’s I have grown to be so attached to. They are not leather, but man-made non- flexible material cut to a size unknown to me. They are now at a shoe repair shop being stretched for a week with a hopeful change in toe box width so they are wearable. For $8 a pair, they “ might” be acceptable.. Since they were so painful on first try, they have to be better. I am near tears and and am afraid I will need to make another round at the shoe stores to hunt for a different brand and style. If I have any luck, I will update. PS I have ordered medical tape to place on all the painful areas for when I get my shoes back in a week."
3659,1,I could have bought a pair of brand x from Walmart that fit better then these do. They are NOT wide even though they claim they are. I even question if they are real Reebok since I have Reebok sneakers that I was going to replace with these. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY THESE SNEAKERS ARE HORRIBLE! Donating them a neighbor who needs sneakers so badly she will take anything since hers are falling apart. I guess in that case these are better then nothing. If I could have given them a rating in the negative numbers I would have.
3660,3,"I ordered, received, and returned this shoe. I'm not sure what Reebok is thinking. These poorly sized shoe made of inferior material should NOT be marketed as Reebok Princess. Simply stated,, they are falsely advertised. I ordered a 6Wide. The heel of the shoe is very wide, but the toe box (which is the important part of the shoe for me) is narrow, about the same as a 6B. The ""leather"" which is some synthetic form does not give or stretch - like trying to do anything athletic in a street shoe.I have used these shoes to play tennis for many years. Yes, I know they aren't heavy duty tennis shoes, but comfort was more important and I simply absorbed the cost of about 5 pairs a year. I always bought all the size 6 (and more recently 6W) the store had in stock, often walking out with 6 pairs. Back then the quality wasn't always consistent, but I was able to avoid poorly made Princess shoes by being careful about the country in which they were made. For the last couple of years, all of the Princess shoes seem to have been made in Viet Nam. And, every pair is the same poor quality. Stop making them in Viet Nam or send someone over there who knows how they should be made to oversee the product.Reebok, please go back to your original design and qua."
3661,2,"My mom has worn this style of Reebok for years; it's the only shoe that doesn't cause her more pain in her knees & hips. I order the white ones for her in the spring & the black in the fall. I have to order 2 sizes of each due to a medical condition with her feet, so it gets expensive. This last pair of 7W & 5-1/2M are sewn so poorly that they're narrow & dig into her feet, which at her age she can't have happening. She's worn them enough to try to break them in that I can't return them & has even tried to cut into the seams on the inside of the shoe so they aren't rubbing her raw. The black pairs I ordered last fall were also lessor quality but she was doing less walking in the winter so she just put up with it. Not sure if it's a quality control issue or if they're all made cheaply now, but sadly we'll have to start searching for another brand/style she can wear."
3662,1,"No longer good!I thought I was going crazy, because I had been wearing these shoes for years and years and loved them, always had a pair or sometimes two handy for when the old pair's life was ending, and suddenly the same size didn't fit at all and my feet got extremely smelly and sweaty while wearing them. My old pair still fit and so did other shoes, so it had to be the shoes. But reading these reviews I know that it isn't me... Do not buy these shoes! Bad about this website: I was just chatting with an employee to ask about this issue before reading theses reviews and he told me that nothing changed when I literally asked about it. So that is no way to treat a customer, it's basically a lie... They should be honest about this change, they cheapened the production, making this a bad shoe, not what you could get before.To top it off, I sent in this review at the Reebok website before and it was turned down for not meeting their standards. I checked, nope, it's up to standard alright. I guess Reebok is not into honest criticism? So submitting this review to amazon and other places now, I mean I took the time to write it..."
3663,1,"VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS SHOE. I ALWAYS WAIT TO GIVE MY REVIEWS ON A PRODUCT FOR THIS VERY REASON. IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I PURCHASED THESE SHOES OVER THE SUMMER. AS A FRESH PAIR OF WHITE CHUCK TAYLORS IS AN AWESOME STAPLE TO HAVE TO ANY SUMMER OUTFIT. TO PRESERVE THEM AS LONG AS I COULD I WORE THEM SPARINGLY TO LAST ME THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER. HERE WE ARE 4 MONTHS LATER (NOV 2015) AND THE RUBBER ON THE SIDE OF THE SHOE HAS BEGUN SEPARATING FROM THE CANVAS PART OF THE SHOE. THERE ARE A PAIR OF CHUCK TAYLORS THAT I HAVE HAD SINCE COLLEGE (2007) WITH MUCH MORE WEAR AND TEAR AND THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED WITH THOSE PAIR OF SHOES. THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY IMITATION CHUCK TAYLORS. I'VE BEEN SHOPPING WITH AMAZON FOR OVER 10 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE WITH ANYTHING BEING OF HORRIBLE QUALITY. I HAVE BEEN A VERY HAPPY AND LOYAL CUSTOMER WITH AMAZON. HOWEVER, I WOULD BE VERY WARY OF THE INTEGRITY OF THIS SELLER. (JUST REALIZED I WROTE THIS REVIEW LAST YEAR FOR THE YOUNG PRODUCT)."
3664,3,"I have been wearing converse for over 7 years at this point. Every year I buy a new pair, and this was supposed to last me the fall semester of college, and hopefully into spring. I specifically did not wear them at all until I got to school 2 weeks ago, to keep them fresh and new. They fit nicely and looked good, but already the rubber trim is tearing off the side and one of the shoelace grommets broke today! Every other pair I've owned has lasted AT LEAST 6 months before I started seeing any wear or tear. It really pains me to give these shoes a bad review, but for the money I spent, this pair of Converse has disappointed me."

3666,3,"It took me awhile to figure out if these were authentic or not, especially after reading all the reviews. The key indicator I found was on the size tag on the inside of the tongue: authentic Converse have the size in “CM” in the last column, and fakes say “MM”. Authentic Converse boxes also shouldn’t have any writing in Chinese.All in all, if your goal is to make people think you’re wearing authentic Converse, these are very convincing. However, 1) why would you spend the same amount on fake Converse that you would on real ones and 2) because these aren’t authentic they will fall apart much faster."
3667,1,"My first pair of converse lasted me 8 years before needing a replacement. The replacements I ordered, the same exact pair I previously owned, lasted less than two weeks before I had to begin repairing them myself.At first the white rubber lining on the outside began to quickly come off the shoe allowing water to seep inside whenever I stepped on the tiniest of puddles outside. A $1.00 bottle of super glue from Walmart seemed to take care of this problem and the rubber outside stuck better than whatever garbage adhesive was originally used. I thought this was a one time fluke, but before I knew it I had to systematically re-glue the entirety of the white rubber all around each of the shoes!I would’ve returned the shoes immediately if I hadn’t foolishly disposed of my old Converse, but it was too late and I decided to make best of this situation. Again I was wrong. Even though I had completely re-attached the white rubber to each shoe, water still found its way in no matter what I did. Many wet socks later I decided to give up on Converse. If I wanted my feet to get wet, I would’ve bought sandals.Converse used to be solid shoes, but ever since they got bought out the quality noticeably declined in order to save a few pennies and delivering an inferior product. I don’t know how multi-million dollar company screws up something as basic as a shoe, but they managed to do it.Save your money and get another brand competent enough to withstand small puddles of water."
3668,1,"They have gule on them just like the 1st pair they sent me. I had them send me a new pair and the same thing happened, but with more brownish glue on the side and bottom of the sole. The others ( the first shipment of the same shoe) had glue on both shoe's this one has a glue spot bigger than a quarter you cant wipe off and you see it because it is right on the sole next to theword Fila on the side. Maybe ,that is why they have different prices on different sizes. Maybe it depends on how much glue you are going to get on your shoes! I will have to return this second pair as well. Very frustrating when you point out the problem and why you are returning the shoes and they don't care enough to even make sure the replacements are okay to ship to you. They should at least let you know these shoes are seconds before sending them to you. They just don't care about anything but getting ride of all their seconds."
3669,3,"4 years ago I had a pair of these and loved them. they had the support I needed and wore them everywhere. I wore them out after 2 years and couldn't find a pair of all white fila's in my area so I bought k-swiss. Now finding them online I was excited to have them again. first of all they are a great looking shoe, but these are not the shoe they were. Reviews said to order a half size big, so I reluctantly did. Not big enough. These shoes are well undersized. they don't have that feel good feeling they had when you wear them. they are hard and feel as though they would be hard to break in. and cheap. I pulled my old fila's out to compare and the quality isn't there. They just feel cheap. Too bad. They were a great shoe. I am returning these and have gone back to k-swiss. Bring back the quality. I will pay for it."
3670,1,Be very careful when buying these shoes an dont use their size recommender.i used that an i got a size 10.5 shoe that is ridiculously huge on my foot so i cant wear it nobody wants to buy it an it cost the price of a shoe to send it back.so i would say be careful when buying these shoes because they are naturally very big an if u get the wrong size your in trouble.
3671,1,"Very disappointed that the ad information is false / incorrect. I have emailed Amazon and the seller. If you see the ad and it still says they are leather at all, then the ad is still incorrect. The shoe label clearly shows these are 100% synthetic materials with a textile (synthetic) base. No leather anywhere on this shoe at all. I bought a pair of these about 10 years ago and they lasted a long time and actually had some leather in them. No more leather now. Not as good a shoe anymore. Just cheap fake PU. Not worth the price they are asking for this cheap fabric shoe. To bad everything is getting SO cheap and tacky."
3672,3,"I bought a pair of the white Fila a couple weeks ago after reading the reviews about ordering a half size up I went ahead and got an 11 typically wear a 10.5 good thing I did because the 11 fit perfectly I loved the comfort so much that I decided to get another couple pairs another white and a black pair, the size 11 white pair fit the exact same as the ones I bought prior.. but trying on the black pair I found them extremely tight in the toe box and rubbing my little toe on the side as well as my toes going all the way up in the shoe pushing inside the end. From the outside they look exactly the same size but upon pulling the innersoles and measuring them I found the black pair a full size smaller then the white or about a quarter of an inch, i've provided pictures showing the difference in the size of the insoles on top of each other as you can see it's quite a difference so if you get the black pair I might suggest you go a full size larger I will be returning these for a size 11.5.. I really love this shoe overall they are super comfortable providing you get the correct size."
3673,2,"The description clearly states that these are leather. This is completely false. They are man-made materials. The upper does not have ANY natural leather on it. 100% fake, man-made materials (or ""pleather"" [for ""plastic leather] as I call it).I went ahead and slipped one on just to see whether the sizing was even correct and it was WAY off. I normally wear a size US 11. I read reviews saying to order a half-size up in these, so I got an 11.5. Even still, these things are way too short. I'd probably have to get a 12.5 in these in order to have a fit.Immediately returned them and will get something else. Probably a pair of Five Ten Freeriders."
3674,3,"I ordered these shoes to replace a pair of Rockports. I choose this shoe because of the reviews that I read saying they are comfortable. I work as a Dealer in a Casino so I am on my feet 8 hours a day so I need shoes that are comfortable which my Rockports were. Even though the reviews were positive on comfort , I am very disappointed with that. I find that there is very little comfort at all...rather hard...hardly any cushion at all. Not a bad looking shoe but for what I wanted , these shoes just don't cut it.I ordered a 1/2 size larger because the reviews said they ran small.....not necessary....should have ordered my size."
3675,2,"I think it is a shame I have to pay to return shoes that are way too small. I buy many different brands from different companies. I have no problem with my size, DC makes shoes ridiculously small. DC has a bad return policy, I wanted to return these for a larger size. No way, you have to reorder a new pair at the going price and pay an outrageous price to return the first pair. I will not buy DC products and I am unhappy with Amazon, they make enough and should make me whole for this purchase. The freight was not a few bucks, it was almost half the price of the shoes. I am very disappointed and will look elsewhere in the future. The buyer should use a size chart reflecting how small these shoes are made and increase the size accordingly."
3676,3,"Despite ordering the next shoe size up as other customers mentioned, these shoes were still too small, so I sent them back and Amazon as usually was very helpful and helped me scedule a free pick-up of the shoes by UPS and provided me with a full refund including tax and shipping. I've heard of needing to order the next shoe size up, but needing to order the next 2 shoe sizes up is unreasonable, and I have doubts even then that the shoes would fit right. I liked the look of these shoes, shoes need to fit right though, not just look good."
3677,1,"Ordered these a 1/2 larger because I read that they ran small in the reviews. However it’s not the length but the toe box width that caused a problem! My right foot was in severe pain after a week. I kept wearing them thinking they would stretch, NOT! My right pinky toe was smashing the next toe over to the point it was red, hard and painful as hell!!!The shoe seems like good quality, loved the style, so it got a star. I’m not confident a larger size would help, the shoe would be too big.There was ample room for the larger toes in the shoe lengthwise, but sides were not wide enough at the toes."
3678,3,"I wear an 8 but since this is only available in half sizes i purchased the 8.5. Just standing still with socks on they fit in length and my toes didnt hit the front of the shoes so i thought great, lets go for a walk. I have average width feet and the toe box on these shoes is HUGE, my feet immediately started sliding around in the shoes from all the space in the toe box, even with socks on. My toes kept smashing up against the front of the shoe and side to side just walking on a flat level sidewalk. I had to turn around and go home just a couple houses down from mine since walking in these was completely impossible. Maybe if you have very wide feet then your feet wont slide around in the front of the shoe, but otherwise if you have medium/average width feet then dont buy these."
3679,1,"I bought these shoes before going on a 6 week trip to Europe. I knew I would be walking a lot and wanted something that would be comfortable on my feet, easy to get in and out of, easy to dry if wet, reasonably priced and stylish.These were none of the above.I wore them for a bit before the trip to break them in, and quickly realized they were not as comfortable as I was hoping they would be. The extra padding in the heel that I thought would be comfy and soothing to my feet, ended up giving me knee pain and 0 support for my foot. The top of the shoe is like a stretchy sock material, which I thought would be great for the reasons listed above, offered NO structural support, and if you're someone who has a slight over pronation on your feet like me, you'll find that the sock-like fabric and the extra padding work against you when trying to correct your pronation. There is NOTHING to keep your foot from sliding sideways and out of the shoe. Now, my feet aren't If anything. the way the padding of the shoe wears as it's broken in over time, it exaggerates the over pronation even more. There is also no treads on the bottom of the shoe, making these even more uncomfortable for walking and hiking in. I was less than a week and a half into my trip when the shoes were so uncomfortable, I marched into an H&M in Helsinki and spent 10 Euros on a pair of generic sneakers, ditching this pair on top of a trash can, hoping maybe they would find some owners that they would be better suited for. I really cannot stress how uncomfortable these were on my feet. Would NOT recommend."
3680,2,"So the first thing I noticed when I opened the bag was the stench. these shoes have not had time to outgas at all before they were zipped in a plastic bag. I""m sure the smell would have gotten better over time, but then I tried them on. I ordered an 8-1/2 and received a 39. I've never had a pair of 8-1/2 shoes not fit, but my toes pushed against the end of the shoe. To make matters worse, the insole is about a half inch too short for the shoe, creating a gap at the end that would surely leave blisters. Such a disappointment since other reviews were so positive. I'm returning them."
3681,1,I would give the seller and shoes a 0 star if I could. I was super excited when I got the shoes so o bought a pair for myself (November) and my mother (January). They advertise that they are Athletic shoes and these shoes are far from being Athletic. I had my shoes for about 6 months and they got holes at the bottom of them. I reached out to the seller to see if they would either give me my money back or replace the shoes. They don’t care about the customers at all. Their response to me was “maybe you should have bought a different kind of shoe like Nike or Adidas” And no other shoe company would give you a refund or replacement. Which in fact is not true. They said I had a month if I wasn’t happy I could have returned them. A month Wow!! Really!? There is no way to determine durability in a month. All I did was use the shoes for what they were advertised them for “Walking” I didn’t know there was a limit to how long and how much you walk!*Warning if you use the shoes for walking on pavement or roads you will get holes. These shoes are for soft surface areas only. The shoes are cheaply made....hence the price!
3682,3,"UPDATE* After months of wearing this shoe, as comfortable as they are, the squeak in the right shoe has NOT gone away. I would love to rate them 5 stars but because I now sound like a toddler walking with these shoes, I find myself not wearing them.The shoes themselves fit great and in all honesty are better than I expected. They are super comfortable and I have been wearing them everyday for 2 weeks now. The problem is that the right shoe has a constant squeak sound and it seems to be internally as strange as that sounds. Although I love them, I feel like a little kid when I walk with the squeaky toys inside them so you know where the kid is. Still hoping it will work itself out but 2 weeks in and it isn't looking good."
3683,3,"I wear normal 10.5m in all brands without issue. I own other Under Armour brand shoes in 10.5m. I do not have these issues with any other shoe. This shoe is made for people with narrow feet who are flat footed. The length is the correct size, but it is really tight on the sides and top of my foot. I had difficulty getting the shoe on because it is so tight. This is the first day I have worn the shoes and there are sharp shooting pains in my arches because of a lack of arch support, and it feels like it is cutting off circulation in my foot because of how tight the shoes fit."
3684,2,"I've worn court and running shoes the majority of my life (over dress and other styles). They are what I wear when I go out somewhere and what I wear to work, so the style and feel are very important to me. I've got several miles on these shoes now, so I'm comfortable writing a review.For style, these shoes look pretty nice. Stitching and glue and whatever else holds these together looks well done and no obvious defects in craftsmanship. Material is easy to wipe clear so far. The tongue is a little bit narrow and I've noticed that at times, I can see my sock if I don't center the tongue perfectly. That is a little bit annoying as I've never owned a pair of shoes where I was worried about the tongue.For comfort, I've ended up a bit disappointed. After long walks and sometimes even just driving, my feet ache and tingle. There's something about the arch and tightness across the bridge that makes my foot uncomfortable. I'm generally a 11 extra wide and found a size 11 XW. In the toe section, these shoes feel about like every other extra wide. Length seemed good and I had little movement in the heal. The part that didn't make sense to me was in the bridge over the top the middle of foot. It's tight. The tongue of the shoe is kind of narrow to begin with, so as I've loosened the shoe more and more to help my foot not feel like it was being strangled, the tongue now can allow my sock to show. It's almost as if the shoe is 1 or 2 sizes too small in the middle.Now I don't have oddball feet and never had an issue previously with shoes. I've worn Rebok for so many years that I can't remember what I wore before them. I unfortunately could find a pair like I had worn for the past 5 years (they were on their last leg and then some), so I took a chance on this new brand. They cushion is nice, although my feet just are not that comfortable in them. I wouldn't purchase these again and I've had them too long to return. I kept thinking they just needed to loosen up and would break in. My feet feel like they are breaking instead...."
3685,3,"The shoes Look great, feel great and they fit great. The only problem is when I'm walking there is a clicking sound on the bottoms of the shoes, and it makes me feel like they weren't glued right. It's really annoying because I cant find the spot and every time I take a step it goes click click click. I can't return on Amazon because I already threw my old pair away and I have to ship these back before they send out new ones or a refund. I'm not sure if I got unlucky what this pair or if they are all like this but it's not worth it."

3687,3,"I've had two pairs of the Assert 6 and loved them, the 7 isn't an improvement. The mesh material isn't the same quality as the 6 - it has a cheap, shiny appearance - and the padding in the collar and tongue seems thinner and less plush. They also seem narrower than the 6 in my regular size, but that may improve over time. It's still a decent shoe, but the 6 was overall nicer and was a really good value. Seems like sometimes these model changes are mainly cost-cutting exercises."
3688,1,"DO NOT BUY!!! The soles separated from the upper in less than 4 months... And no recourse.. At best, I wore them once a week for 4 months.. Am looking for a different brand... that lasts more than 4 months.Update... Bought shoes in May 2015, is now September 2015. The soles have separated from upper on one shoe and stitching is pulling apart on other shoe! For the money...should have lasted more than 4 months..... Maybe worn them one a week... Poor quality...Disappointed and will contact seller...Tried some generic brands.. which lasted about a year..Came back to the Sperry brand!These shoes are comfortable and durable...Will buy them again!"
3689,3,"I had a similar experience as another reviewer. Three months after I bought these, the glue disintegrated. The stitching became exposed. The stitches held but stretched, allowing the sole to be pulled away just a bit. The side looks very iffy now, especially near the stitches, as though it might rip out at any moment.I wore these shoes in a casual shorts and t-shirts office environment in a desert / San Diego. Heh. No rain or water got to them. So it's unclear why the glue would just fail.I had other Sperry shoes and didn't have much of an issue other than the soles wearing a bit fast. I'll post photos soon.

3690,2,"At first glance, these seemed to be perfectly great shoes and after initially ordering the wrong size and an easy exchange, we were pleased with the purchase. However, after my husband wore these for a few weeks while teaching, the sole started falling apart on the right shoe. Unfortunately it happened on day 31, so the return window has been closed for this item. Very disappointed in this shoe, especially considering the price. If these were cheap knockoffs, I would think we got what we deserved. However, for $100, this is very troubling. Looking at other reviews, this seems to be a problem that needs to be fixed. Will not be buying again."
3691,1,"Sperry used to be the go to for boat shoes. Now they make cheap crap.This was to replace my 7 year old Bill Fish that wore like iron... everyday, in the summer.. on the boat.The new version of these has crappy leather, cheap laces, and the fit is all messed up (narrow with pointy toes). These used to be functional boat shoes. The new version is even missing the trademark sipping on the treads. Dangerous on a boat without.So if you are a pant pegging, IPA sipping, skinny jean wearing hipster... these are your boat shoes.If you are looking for functional boat shoes that will last, and are actually in use for a boat... Time to find a new shoe."
3692,3,"I used to live in Sperry Top-Siders back in my college days and for years afterwards. They were well made, comfortable and consistent. Admittedly it's probably been a decade since my last purchase. I was shocked at the poor quality of this product. The leather was so thin I was afraid to tie the laces for fear it would tear. The laces were not the leather kind that I was used to back in the day. They were a cheap synthetic cloth, as fragile as the leather upper. I thought perhaps it was just a defective pair, but when I opened the box containing the other Sperry pair (different style/color) I found those to be of equally poor quality. I didn't even bother to try them on. Both pairs went back to Amazon the next day. Thank goodness for free returns."
3693,2,"I washed these hoping to shrink them so that they would fit better. This did not work and I still have to wear 2 pairs of socks to be somewhat comfortable. After washing, the insole color is now bleeding through the white canvas. I had purchased a size 6 medium , my normal size and they were so tight I couldn't get them on so that is why I bought the 6 w and that too doesn't work. I am very dissatisfied with these shoes. I spoke to KED's customer service and they said that these canvas shoes are not made to be washed. I have always washed my sneaks when dirty now she says they are not made to be washed so I would have to wear them dirty or try and sponge wipe them off. I will never buy another pair of KEDS products again. Is there anyway I can send them back to Amazon for a refund? There was no product care instructions with any of the KEDS that I purchased to warn me to not wash them."
3694,3,"Not only were they poorly made, much to narrow a foot bed for the size (11) and absolutely no support. The thin blue foot bed padding turned the wash bright blue. All of the wash, not just the shoes. The blue came out of the clothes after washing them again since I did not put them in the dryer. But the shoes only turned brighter blue. I've used Oxyclean, bleach, and will try one more time with Rit. In the mean time I went to Wall World and bought a pair for $5.97 that aren't too skinny for a size 11, but they don't have much support either. So I ordered inexpensive arch supports, and now have a shoe that at least resembles the old Keds. I still wanted a pair of good looking sneakers for bike riding so I ordered a pair of Glagla sneakers on Amazon and absolutely love them. They are well made, very light, vented well so they are cool and comfortable with a stiff enough sole for riding."
3695,1,"I bought these for my wife. She wears size 8.5. She also has a pair that we bought from a retail store. The ones we bought from Amazon, were really uncomfortable on her. I told her to break em in. It's probably because they're new. Meanwhile... It's been several months, and still not fitting right! I said, ""let's check the tags"", ""maybe one is ""narrow"", and one is wide""? Checked the tags. Tags were different.. One was imprinted on the canvas, the other, an ""iron on sticker"". After that I did some digging. There were several variances in the two shoes. I have reason to believe that these shoes are fakes. My wife's owned several pairs of these EXACT shoes over the years, and they've never had this issue. Buyer beware. I would buy from a brick and mortar store for something like this in the future."
3696,3,"I bought these Keds a while back and only opened them this week for a vacation. The return window has closed of course. I should have inspected them when they arrived. One of the two shoes was very dirty. It had spots on it that actually looked like urine! As well as smudges, I noticed when I wore them that I got black spots on the top of my feet. Turned out there was some sort of black marker on the inside of the tongue of each of the shoes that was coming off on my foot. Looked like some sort of marking for seconds."
3697,2,"okay so this is the second pair of keds i've ordered, and i am really dissapointed! With the first pair, i noticed that he rubber was pulling away from the sole after only a few months of owning. I don't wear these everyday, only when i'm running errands. Anyway I thought maybe they are just a bad apple, and ordered again. Let me tell you, they are poorly made! Not only is the rubber pulling away from the soles, but now the fabric is fraying and there's a hole. I am NEVER ordering again...what happened to the quality of these shoes? They were the only shoes I wore in high school, and they never fell apart the way these do!"
3698,3,"So, I bought this as a Christmas gift for my family. We did not get around playing it for several months. So you can imagine how disappointed I wS when I got around to play the ring toss with my family that one of the boards was very badly warped and the paint was not on all the way. Very cheap and disappointed. Went to exchange the item and it had been too long, so I could not exchange. Great concept otherwise. It folds nicely into the bag provided, so it would be easy to take to the park or beach."
3699,3,It's smaller than I expected but it appears to be made with quality materials. I'd prefer it more if the price was only $15 but hey what can u do?We got it for the beach to add to variety to our sand games.The setup is easy (although you do have to take a minute to screw in the 5 rods to the base). The game is easy for kids to understand and the kids liked it. Its also easy to transport.I like the option to use rope or plastic rings and there are a lot of rings.We looked at a lot of other ring games on amazon and i do believe this is probably the best option. Again it would be nice if it was just a bit larger but otherwise it's good.
3700,3,"I got this for a group of kids and adults to play with during bbq hang out. Its a pretty good value, its super easy to put together and seems sturdy enough. My only complaint is the weight on the rings. The plastic rings are more or less worthless, unless you are a toddler who just walks over there and places it on top. They are to small and light to throw and if you happen to get it in place they tend to jump right off. The rope rings are better, but still wish they had more weight to them. You better hope it isn't a windy day when you want to play. The bag is great, which is the reason I chose this particular brand."
3701,1,"Updated review** I can't express enough how disappointed I am with this game. I wrote the review below after using the ring toss game three times with my family. Everyone liked this game and I have received numerous requests for info on where to purchase. During the fourth time playing this game one of the wooden screws broke when we simply tried to unscrew the peg and put in in the storage case. Usually we keep the parts together and do not unscrew them because it seems flimsy. NotOnly did it break, the wooden pieces are still stuck in the bottom of the board so even if we receive a replacement peg we still can't use the board. What a major disappointment and this game was way too expensive at over $20 to break after four uses. Very dissapointed customer. My kids are sad because they really enjoyed this game and I was using this as something fun that we could do throughout the summer as we spend a lot of time at the park and the kids enjoy this type of game. I do not recommend this product but I hope they can make better parts because it was fun while it lasted.First review***Came with all the parts as advertised. It took about a minute to screw the pegs in the holes and we were playing. Kids and adults loved it. The ropes seem sturdy so far and we also use the plastic rings that came with it. I love the carrying case although we only store the ropes and rings in there. The wooden pieces we keep those screwed together and we just hang it on the wall on our patio so we don't have to keep putting it together. Having it like that certainly means my kids play with it more often."
3702,3,"This is a great game for the entire family and a good way to ""unplug"" from electronics and other gadgets. The game itself no doubt deserves 5 stars.However, I am disappointed with the workmanship. I have bought many wooden toys and games, and from the positive reviews I had high expectations. (1) One of the wooden sticks in my set does not screw into the slot all the way so is left slightly wobbly; (2) the X-section has uneven wood chips sticking out so I recommend having an adult to do the assembly so to avoid splinters on little hands; (3) the green carry bag is a great idea and helps for bringing the game to grandma's home but the zipper is of poor quality and broke after 2 uses; and (4) the ring tosses are made of a very rough rope material and little bits stick out and poke against little hands."
3703,1,"Poor quality. Not accurately described. If used in the Context of why someone would purchase this, you'd do as well with a cardboard box with holes cut and throw old golf balls, etc. This is so cheaply made its hard to believe it's on Amazon, and handled by them. For this money, OMG so expensive, -- and where made, I don't get why not used recycled composite plastic board, -- it would hold up/last and be more formally festive (why I purchased for July 4th weekend...). Again, otherwise, paint a cardboard box up and throw bars of soap. Very very disappointed."
3704,1,"We ordered this item for a christmas morning present. When I opened the box to put it together on xmas eve, I found several of the legs to be broken on this item and others not to fit or stay in place. It was a large disappointment. Given the $35 price tag, I would expect these legs to be made more sturdy It is cheap plastic that clearly breaks on its own.Additionally, I emailed the company about this problem and still haven't heard back from them weeks later. I would not recommend this in the least!"
3705,3,This bean bag toss game is really small. For $40.00 we expected to receive a nice backyard game. Unfortunately this game did not meet our expectations. It's really a game for small children that I wouldn't expect to pay more than $20.00 for. The legs are very flimsy and we keep having problems with them staying on and the game remaining stable. This is something I would expect to find in a pre-school setting for toddlers. I have teens and they were not impressed.
3706,3,"I ordered this a week before Christmas, as a gift for my nephew.. It was received in a larger box with many other items. I nevered opened the game box itself, I just wrapped it with the other gifts and put everything under the tree. Christmas day my nephew opened this present & was very disappointed to find two of the four (plastic) leg stands were broken. I never thought to look in the box, there was no damage to the box or anything else I received with this game."
3707,3,"Bought for Easter so I was unable to just box it back up for return. The fact that it arrived damaged was pretty disappointing. The boards are heavy, the black side is a nice foam. The ""wood"" side is like drawer liner, a wood sticker paper. The thin board underneath was chipped on mine. The paint around the holes was also coming off (but I can repaint that).The bags are just small basic bean bags, the washers are decent weight plastic washers.I'd recommend this but buy far enough in advance to open and return should it be chipped."
3708,3,"We received this cracked which is probably not the norm but worth mentioning. We thought this was great product. We have two kids that love connect for and decided this would be a great back yard addition.A few drawbacks/ reasons for the loss of stars:- It is not very movable. The board slides in to the leg supports and if you wanted to move it you have to move it as a whole unit. Being that it so large it's not the easiest to move two legs and the board while keeping it together.- The method to empty the board is not the most user friends. It can only be opened from one side of the playing board.- We worried about the wear of it being outside. We are located in the hot and humid state of Florida and worried about the wood / particle board warping. We get rain showers everyday, often unannounced so this was a huge factor for us.Pros:- Large colorful pieces- The carrying case is super convenient and well made."
3709,3,"I purchased this item over 2 years ago for my Luxury vacation rental and have had it repaired three times since. the design is highly flawed, it is not intuitive to new players what the mechanism is to dislodge the pieces, therefore new users try to figure out how to release pieces and by the time they figure it out, bit by bit guests weaken the integrity of the game. i have drawn arrows and written directions on the game in an effort to assist new players how to release the pieces. It is a real shame."
3710,3,"The Giant 4 in a row was ordered for our daughter's reception- and unfortunately arrived less than Perfect- more like used condition! One leg is cracked and there are numerous chips and scratches all over the game. It definitely looks like we were sold someone else's return! The game plays well and all the pieces are there, but very disappointing that all the cosmetic flaws are there. Not sure if worth reordering and returning- because the next one might be scratched and broken even more and then we wont have in time for the reception."
3711,3,"We purchased it for use by our grand kids outside under our covered pergola. Within the first week the paint was peeling off and even though it was covered when not in use, the humidity or heat continued to create a problem. Not only did the paint peeled off, it warped. The coins would fall behind the other coins making the game useless. It is a wonderful game and the kids love it, it can not be used outside under any conditions. We should have purchased one made with plastic. The wood has fallen apart. First time we were let down by a Amazon purchaseSince I have written the above, GoSports has been in contract with me and have been very helpful. We were past the refund date with Amazon and they offered us a brand new replacements. We appreciate a second chance and will very carefully about allowing it to sit in the high humidity of SC. Their service representative was great."
3712,1,"Terrible quality, paint is peeling after just one week of being outside.Description references ""makes for a unique accent in the backyard and is a hit at parties, cookouts, outdoor weddings, and more!"" Clearly cannot be left outside.But who wants to faf with setting it up each time? This was purchased for our company's roof deck so the idea was to have it out all the time. Additionally, the bar at the bottom to release the coins is now broken. Waste of money and looks awful - now in the trash."
3713,1,"I am extremly dissapointed in the quality of the official Spike Ball kit. For a product that costs $50 I expected that at least this kit could last me more than one session of normal Spike Ball play. In my very first session the frame of the net cracked in THREE separate places and as a result I have had to tape each of the cracks and attempt to continue to play. This frame uses extremly cheap, hollow, TPU tubes that easily crack and break.Although I love this game, I cannot in good faith recommend this product to anyone I know."
3714,1,"I had previously given this a 4 star rating. Not 5 due to the over-cost. However, after my sons played it a handful of times, they quickly got bored and said it just sucked. They actually played only a few times and we packed away for the year in our storage. They decided to give it another shot this year (after I complained about how much I spent on it) and the main outer ring snapped in half. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. Extremely disappointed. They now play croquet and KanJam almost daily.Purchased at my 20 yr. old son's request. Played once with friends and said we ""have"" to have it for our group of boys. They LOVE it. However, I feel it is super over-priced. A plastic base with a net and 1 ball for $60 was not easy for me to swallow. Also, I was disappointed to see that the ball barely bounces......looked for a way to perhaps tighten the net. The ball is fully inflated. All in all, a fun game for them to play and for us to watch. Hopefully, the price will come down as I foresee a replacement in the near future."
3715,3,This is a fun game however the net sucks. I would not recommend spending the money on this. Especially since we are always re-stretching out the net and it just does not have enough bounce to it. We seriously have had more fun with a small exercise tramp and racquetballs and get a better result. Just my opinion maybe we are playing it wrong and don't really understand the game but I think if it had a better net or bouncing system it would be awesome and more worth the money. This is really cheap in my opinion. Sorry and Thanks.
3716,3,"I was so disappointed with this; I really wanted to love it. The concept it great; it just feels like the quality of materials were not worth the $50 we spent on it. The netting shredded on the edges as soon as we wrapped it around the bar to secure it. We couldn't get it tight enough to really make the ball bounce but didn't want to risk tearing it more. In reading the review, perhaps there is an upgrade version floating around. We were able to purchase a similar game at Target on clearance for $2.50 that was made of metal and a strong mesh that worked 10x better than this. Thankfully we tried it out before throwing the box away or leaving on vacation (where we'd planned to use it)."
3717,1,***DON'T THROW AWAY THE BOX***I consider myself a pro when putting things together. When it came to this I felt like an idiot. It seems simple but the issue is the net and the flimsy yellow legs.The net pulled tight makes everything draw in. Therefore the legs do NOT stand up like in this picture. It's more lopsided.If you loosen it then the balls won't bounce!!! The net is to cheap. Trust me there is no in between. (My husband tried to make it work as well.)I watched UTube videos and of course the directions as well!! Maybe we will get it but who knows. I'd return had we not throw the box away. :(.
3718,2,"I did not buy this item because after researching it throughout the web, the problem is that you don't know what you're actually getting. If you look at the Walmart site, it shows the ""ful size premium bocce set"" has the 100mm balls (3.93"") for $50, another full size (but not premium) for $45 and a regular set that has 90mm balls (3.5"") at $35. However, here on Amazon, the title shows this as a full size set, but in the description it mentions 3.5"" balls. From the reviews, it looks like many people expected 100mm and got 90mm balls, except for the last person. So that's not enough information for me to buy them here at Amazon. I ended up getting my set on the Hayneedle site, which has many sets to choose from, good prices and free shipping. Also, someone mentioned this set doesn't have the right etching marks to play with the right number of players. I didn't know what this meant since I'm new to bocce, until I went on the Hayneedle site. Those are the lines on the balls (the design). On the pic for this product, there are only green and red balls and they all have the same design, which means that you can only play with 2 people or two teams or you won't be able to tell the balls apart. The Hayneedle site shows this exact Trademark set for $49 but with 2 different etching designs. That means you can play with 4 people. I ended up going with a similar set for $45 (I liked the colors better)."
3719,3,"I can't believe Amazon put this in a box and mailed it as a new item, how disappointing! First of all there was nothing wrapped around this to make it appear new, the bag has a 2 inch tear right in the top! 4 of the 8 balls have dings, scratches and actual pin size holes in them, now I know that eventually we will bang these around, but the whole point of something NEW is that WE will bang them around! Sending me someones return is not a way to do business. Also, there was not anything packaged that showed us any company info, who this was made by etc. There was not even an invoice in my box! Fathers Day fail big time! Top that off with searching the Amazon site endlessly so I could call and talk to someone in person about this, they have made it impossible to find any way to connect with a human! Back it goes and hopefully I get reimbursed for the one day shipping!"
3720,3,"2 of the red balls had small holes in them all the way through to the inner part of the ball. Almost all of the balls had nicks or scratches on them. They seemed like ok quality balls other than that, but I returned them as I don't trust an already defective product. I wish they hadn't been messed up, I really wanted to start playing! I am guessing by reviews that not all of the sets have defects in them. They are also a little small compared to most balls I've used, but I'd say some people might like that or dislike that about them. The research continues to find a quality set of bocce balls..."
3721,3,"I purchased this at end of season last year. I started playing with it this summer (the last few weeks). One of the red balls chipped in the dirt. I wouldn't expect it to chip like it did to make it unusable. I'd like to see if I can return/ get a replacement for this as it should have a longer life than playing with it a few times. Please let me know how we can resolve this. Also balls scratch very easily on this, which is really interesting as well. It chipped again the time I just reused it. I asked for a refund and was charged a re-stocking fee. I would like to be given the restocking fee back since I would like to purchase a more expensive better version of this."
3722,3,These intermediate set of Bocce Balls are better than the small and lighter family Bocce Balls and the heavier and larger regulation Bocce Balls. They are good for non-professional players who are just out to have fun with older kids and adults. The problem is all the Balls are really green! The red balls and small white ball are lightly sprayed with cheap paint that is easily scraped off when the balls hit each other. Soon all the balls will be red. Very disappointed.
3723,3,"I don't know what everyone is raving about but the quality of the construction and packaging was so terrible and cheap it was half broken when it showed up. Everything (markers and wristbands) other than the orb is made of super hard brittle plastic that breaks off into hard sharp pieces like glass. If anything is bumped slightly it shuts of, often permenantly . I might have an old version, I ordered back in February and didn't bother opening it and trying to play until we had summer weather and now it's of course too late to return.The company offered me a full refund, but it's still a terrible product."
3724,1,"Expensive price tag...extremely cheap construction. Half of the wristbands broke before we ever got outside to play. We tried putting them back together, but they kept falling apart while players were running. Additionally, a couple of the light up territory lights moved in their casings and now can't be shut and therefore turned on, rendering them useless. One of the orbs fell apart the first time it was captured, and we lost the non-glowing portion in the darkness. You would be better off (both financially and from a frustration/disappointment standpoint) if you just purchased a bunch of inexpensive glow bracelets in 2 different colors and used them for player and as the markers."
3725,3,"I purchased this game for a surprise 40th birthday. The entire party was themed after it actually. When we opened the box to play neither “flag” lit up. Needless to say...there went the party. I purchased this game plus the extra set of bracelets since it was a large party. We found a way to rig it enough to try to play, but it was a bust...ended up throwing it all away. Complete waste. Definitely try it out before distributing the bracelets in case you need to exchange it. Very expensive game to receive broken. It really would have been fun if it worked properly. Hopefully mine was a fluke."
3726,3,"I bought this for my nephew for his birthday & his Dad assembled it for him. Even after trying to mess with the batteries & exchanging for several different sets of replacement batteries, the lights on the balls WOULD NOT stay lit. That’s the whole reason my nephew wanted this game for his birthday!!! I’m so disappointed now because I’m the Aunt that gave my poor nephew a broken toy for his birthday. It was pretty expensive, too...and since I wasn’t told about the defect (as my sister didn’t want to hurt my feelings), we missed the return/exchange deadline. (Which was only a week after his birthday). Boo to this game & the fact that we’re stuck with a dud. I don’t have the money right now to get him a new one."
3727,3,This item had lots of positive reviews but I didn’t have a very good experience with it. We had 20+ 10-11 year old boys to play capture the flag for a birthday party. One orb kept stopped working which was basically a game stopper. The wristbands don’t stay on and would frequently break. I spend so much time dealing with the wristbands that don’t work well and unsnap easily then break. The markers also didn’t all work correctly and took about 20+ minutes to get some to work. This has good potential but the quality of the products is low. After spending $90 for the main kit and expansion I was quite disapppointed.
3728,3,"I gave this item as a gift. Cloth game mat came sealed in plastic bag. Gift recipient told me that upon opening the bag, the cloth mat gave off a disgusting musty odor. They are going to wash the mat to hopefully remove the smell.If you order this item, give it a thorough 'sniff' test before gifting it to someone. :-(."
3729,3,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas at her request for a huge tapestry checker game like she played at a camp! Since this said Giant I just knew this was it! My daughter opened and was happy but disappointed because it isn’t big at all! Will have to continue to search. Little larger than an average board but not Giant at all!
3730,1,"This was purchased in October as a Christmas present. Upon opening the box this evening we discovered the cloth has mold everywhere. So disgusting, my daughter is disappointed and I am outside my return window. I’d give zero stars if I could."
3731,3,"Years ago, I had stayed at a bed and breakfast that had a checkers mat similar to this. When I saw this on Amazon, I thought this would be a great game for the family as my kids are just learning how to play checkers. I was sorely disappointed in the quality of the mat. It will certainly serve its purpose but I thought I had been buying an identical mat to the one I had seen in person. This one was very cheaply made. The lines are printed on not a part of the fabric itself. I thought the mat would be woven but it is a ribbed knit. I'm keeping it because we can still play checkers on it, but future buyers understand that this is not some high-quality mat. It may last longer that a hard board game (at least in this house), but the fabric is thin and flimsy."
3732,3,pre-purchased for xmas. Looks like the one @ cracker barrel that my grandson loves top play. Unfortunately it came with two sets of red checkers ((no black)) because it was purchased in August I can't return it. guess pa-pa will have to spray paint.... note to self - open and inspect when pre-purchasing.
3733,3,"Not a good product. It's the first product I've ever HOPED would just simply break. Not in any way like the original Jarts (which I think was banned for being dangerous). These darts have no points; they sail inelegantly through the air, and only for a short distance; it's impossible to toss the jarts more than about 15-20 feet; and, finally, they have no points at all, to speak of, so they just kind of land in a dead weight flop on the ground.On the other hand, they can be got for [...], so if your kids are very young, they just might be fooled for awhile into thinking this is a pretty cool toy."
3734,3,"This is awful and I'm quite disappointed. Bought these for use overseas. First game, ruined. As another reviewer mentioned, within a few throws one of them has the vane sliding off on every throw. Another one had the vane split slightly close to the head of the Jart. how can a company sell a product that would break so quickly? How can Amazon allow them to keep doing business here? It would cost me more to return it than it's worth at this point."
3735,3,"Jarts were first sold in the early 1970s. Even then, there was controversey over potential danger and a deal was struck with the FDA (jarts were food or drug?) to mark all products with language similar to ""not a toy/adult use only"" and not to be sold in toy departments. This was executed with less than 100% success.Fast forward to 1988 and a 7-year old girl became the 3rd death as a result of a jart accident -- thrown by her 9-year-old brother and friends; no adult supervision. The grief-stricken father decided that three deaths was one death too many and successfully lobbied Congress and the consumer product safety council to ban jarts.So, there you go. Three deaths over ~15 years, all resulting from the mis-use of a ""not for kids"" sporting good. There were, of course, many non-fatal injuries, too ... but those data have been debated by both sides. In 1997, another child was struck in the head and was in a coma, prompting the CPSC to reissue the ban notification, encouraging anyone possessing contraband jarts to destroy them.In any event, such as with seatbelt laws, we have agreed that we need protection from ourselves and allowed laws to govern our actions. Yippee. As with all officially banned or recalled products, sale and trade of jarts is illegal per federal law (no ebay, no garage sale, etc.).The new product bounces all over the place, which defeats the purpose of jarts (which stuck right were it first landed). Gets really boring, really fast. Stick to the other yard games, such as cornhole, for a better experience. Unfortunatley, jarts is an adult game that is tied to the ability to stick into the ground ... which is too dangerous for Americans and Canadians."
3736,1,"Cheap, unbalanced, cheap, not worth a purchase, If you ever used the old Jarts, just keep the memory and don't expect anything close to the old and dangerous! This is just 4 pieces of plastic that has almost like a spring in the tip and a little bit of sand or weight to make them fly. But Fly they don't! I have 6-8-20 year old grandsons... none want to play with these. Papa...Bring out the cornhole game! So we did, and played for hours. Again, don't waste your time thinking this will be anything close to the Jart game we all remember."
3737,1,"I don't own this game, but I did consider it until I found out that I could still buy the ""real"" jarts of the good old days. You can't buy them in the US or Canada because They were outlawed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 1988. You can't even buy them on eBay because eBay will not allow them to be listed.I did a lot of research and found Crown Darts in the UK. These are the real deal and, while a bit expensive, are very heavy and very well made. I bought every color they offer and bought spare parts in case they aren't around in a few years and something breaks or wears out. This company was great to deal with and I highly recommend them. The only catch is that you need to buy the set as spare parts and ""assemble"" them yourself since it is illegal to import the darts fully assembled. Assembly consists of screwing them together and anybody can do it in 15 seconds per dart.Don't buy this crap, go buy the real thing."
3738,3,"My main reason for giving this a 2 star rating is the price. $60 for two pieces of plastic(even though its thick, durable plastic), 4 balls(basically racquetballs), and a net is a little steep. I would say $40 is the most I would reasonably pay for this type of game, but even then I would wait for a deal. My daughter had 3 friends friends over today. Thankfully it was 3 friends because you need EXACTLY 4 people to play(a con in my opinion). After 5 minutes they gave up because no one could make it into the net. These girls are ages 9-10...so they're not exactly older, but they're not teenie tiny, uncoordinated children either. I thought it was a little bit too hard for them, though I would think this game should be suitable for this age group. After watching them, I'm thinking 13+ might be a better age to play this game. Whether or not this is a good value would depend on how highly you value outdoor activities with your kids/friends. My family enjoys darts, archery, riding scooters, bikes...this game isn't going to be beating any of those anytime soon."
3739,3,"The RampShot Backyard Game is a good idea for a fun game and because of the large set up area and the semi hard balls used, it is definitely an outdoor game.What I am going to address in this review is the assembly of the units. It consists of two large plastic ramps which appear very well made and will likely last with some rough play. There are nets included which fit into the large rectangular holes in the ramps. The nets are not attached. This is where the ball is caught when playing the game. Also included are the four balls.The problem is to attach the nets to some plastic hooks, which surround the large rectangular hole in the ramp. The hooks are inside small holes which surround the large rectangular hole in the ramp.The is a rubber bungee cord which surrounds the net. The net is to be evenly placed around the cord, which is fairly easily done, but not without some work. Then... the cord is to be inserted and hooked onto the plastic hooks all around the out side of the large ramp hole. The first few are easy to attach, but as you move around the rectangular hole the cord gets stretched tighter.The directions say to use a key or other flat object to insert the cord. I ended up with two flat screw drivers and spent about 45 minutes working the cord into the holes and over the hooks. I made sure the screw drivers were not sharp so they wouldn't cut the cord. As I was doing this I kept wondering which was going to break first, the cord, my resolve, or the plastic hooks. It was a hook. They are not very tough. I did get it done to a point that the game is playable with only one broken hook and two rather bent ones.I question why the nets were not attached by the manufacturer. Later... After thinking the whole process over, I came up with a simple tool which could be used to attach the net cord. It is something that could be produced by the manufacturer cheaply and included with the set, or you could make it from a clothes hanger wire. I've included a sketch. The tool could be inserted into the bottom of each hole in the ramp and then looped over the cord and pulled back through and over the plastic hooks. This would be a very cheap fix to the assembly problem."
3740,3,So the ball does not respond off of the ramp even remotely close to how it does in the video. I just don't see what we are possibly doing wrong. We are throwing the ball the same way and same speed as it appears in the video - but the ball does not even come close to responding off of the ramp like in the video.The game was pretty disappointing. My friends were all asking - are we doing something wrong here?I admit - maybe we are doing it wrong - but we really are not enjoying this game.
3741,2,"It's ok, not a bad game, not a great game.It's spring here in Phoenix, which means enjoy the outdoors as much as you can now. I thought this would be a great addition to our family backyard games. My son was anxious to play which made assembly even more infuriating. If he hadn't been hovering, I would have stopped and walked away. I used a screwdriver and my fingers. I found that looping the bungee cord with my fingers and pushing it in with the flat-headed screwdriver worked pretty well. As I was installing, I found that the net bunches in areas as you work. I got completely done with the first ramp only to have the net completely bunched at one end, which meant I had to disconnect and undo the entire net from the ramp. <U+0001F629> That was when I wanted to chuck it over the fence. There is a QR code on the instructions, so I tried scanning that to see if there was additional video or directions for assembly. It took me to the online instructions, which was the exact same instructions I held in my hand, just scanned in on a website. I thought that was pretty silly because in order to scan the QR code I needed the paper in my hand (which has since blown away or has been misplaced). Anyway, the online directions were not any more helpful.Last is to attach the stickers to the front. I still haven't done this. The ramps had dust on them from the shipping process and needed to be wiped down to ensure they adhere properly. My son didn't have the patience for that after the whole net procedure, so I didn't put them on and I haven't since.The game itself was ok. We only had 3 people to play, so since we didn't have teams, we adapted the game. We didn't play long and lost interest quickly. My son has since gone out and played with it by himself trying to throw the ball into the net. (I will add that the video on how to play was helpful after I understood how it was supposed to work. The first time I watched the video, I was overwhelmed with the names of the positions and honestly, a little confused. It makes more sense after you play and then watch the video again.)Overall, I think it would be difficult to justify the $60 price tag for this game. I think some of the excitement was lost during the frustrating set-up. My son watched the video after playing and said it looked like more fun on the video. I have to agree with him."
3742,3," In opening, I will say that this game is a fun game and unique. A good game for a party. It was more fun for the older kids and adults. But, it can be adapted as just a ""toss in"" game for the little ones. Once this thing was put together, it was fine. My main issue was with putting it together. If the nets would have come already installed this would be a 5-star review.I had some issues on the initial install of this item. The game consists of two heavy duty plastic bases, and two nets that is ringed with an elastic rubber band type piece. You have to get the rubber band/elastic into these hooks and there isn't much room for your fingers to do this, especially when you've gotten half of them installed. My attempt was an utter failure.My husband managed to be all manly and took it over and finished it. So, judge away, it was hard for me with fingernails to do this. He did break out a flathead screwdriver though. So, he technically cheated. They could make installing the net a bit easier, in my opinion. Or it could come preinstalled.Secondly, the two bases came cracked out of the box. This could be a shipping issue, maybe the UPS guy dropped it. But the cracks were almost identical on both bases. It took us almost an hour to set this game up, when it should be easy. We weren't trying to put together furniture. If we would have broken this out at a party - the guests would have lost interest quickly."
3743,3,"Looks great in the pictures. However, the final product is lackluster. They seem to be cut with a machine, however the final product with the die numbers leaves much to be desired. Is it burned in? Some are way darker that others. Guess I'll have to break out the stain. As well no finish? So I throw these in my yard and they will absorb water and grass stains? For six 3.5 inch die and spending $50, I would have expected more. This is almost a garage project where I would have produced a much better product. Maybe I will?"
3744,2,"We only used these dice once. The concept of them is awesome, but of course you have to be mindful of the terrain you roll them on. These will not work on grass, sand, or different piles of dirt, etc. These will ONLY work on a flat hard surface in order to be fair and to actually play a dice game. I also do love the concept of the dice being large, however it is really difficult to roll all dice at the same time unless you stack them on top of each other. But this makes it inconvenient and wastes some time that you would actually like to be playing the game. Overall, we would not purchase these again, but like the concept of them.."
3745,3,"They were irregularly shaped, each different and with unequal sides. They had numerous significant cracks. The dots were burned on, but done very poorly (some deep and some barely visible).I had bought them as part of a Christmas gift for an uncle who collects dice, but there was no way I'd give him these, so I returned them. Totally ruined my plans for him. I contemplated pulling out my tools and trying to fix them, but them realized it would be close to the same amount of work for me to just make them myself.*I had photos of just how bad these were, but I guess I deleted them after they were returned.*"
3746,3,"I received what I ordered, but the pictures made the dice look bigger. They are solid wood, but GIANT really doesn't describe dice that are 3.5"". A better, more accurate label would be better. Just pay attention to the details more than the label. I was thinking they were much bigger. I'll keep them because the oversight was mine, but they are really rather small for a yard activity. Shop around, too as the deal ended up being the normal price, and there are cheaper identical sized sets on Amazon."
3747,3,Used these Dice for the first time the same day the package came and was able to play 20mons before one of the dice split in half! So disappointed since I have looked for this game and had other options but spend alot with Amazon. Didn't even get through 1 game! Now I have to send it back and go without. And I have a party planned and this was a big factor in it.
3748,3,"This is the third time I've gotten the big bubble solution. The first year times it was fantastic stuff. But this last time that I got it it's like they're getting ho hum, or tired of doing their jobs of putting the solution together right. It was way too gooey, and the bubbles just don't blow out to be giant bubbles like they were before. And at the price it should be fantastic every single time I order them. Very disappointed this go around. I'm hoping that next time they'll be better because I really love this stuff! Fingers crossed. Get back on the ball peeps. <U+0001F914>"
3749,1,"This product does males very large bubbles but they don't lift or last. Children aged 5 and 7 were unable to draw out the large bubble by sweeping slowly in 1 direction as needed-they tended to twirl no matter what was said. And their body then drakes the bubble before they can enjoy it. And the solution needs to be made in a bucket with hot water. So instead of simple bubbles you buy, you have that to deal with. The apparatus is nothing more than a plastic straw and a piece of what appears to be a type of ribbon or lace used in sewing. I gave it 2stars as the bubbles do look like the ones shown but only when an adult makes the bubbles (in my case). Would not recommend"
3750,3,"Piece of crap...got it today, followed instructions explicitly and only tiny bubbles!! Does this work differently with well water????? LOLFour of us tried it and it was a dud every time. Little tiny bottle of bubble mix and used entire bottle of Dawn trying to get it to work. Maybe the bubble company has stock in Dawn???????Sending it back today! Our grandchildren are very disappointed!!"
3751,3,"I followed directions for mixing exactly. Took the mixture outside, and no bubbles. Kept trying, and still no bubbles, except the small ones made from the hanging loop at top.I kept trying, but the loop slide at the top of the tube came off. This caused the cord to twist, and I could not get it back on.Had a bunch of little girls waiting for the big bubbles....but nothing. We used the mixture with some tiny wands we had, so not all was lost.I was quite disappointed."
3752,1,"The cheapest plastics toy that I have ever came across, I didn't buy it on amazon but the lack of quality from this product is 100 percent the reason it get the 1 star rating .. as the top review stated it's even they had make their own wands , this needs to be re invented to make this product for kids that they could use , also note if their is not wind , your left running around trying to make a bubble that doesn't last , Iam not sure what was more frustrating ?? Trying to make the bubbles or the actual product , what I do know is I would like my refund and my frustrations to go away , looking at this box while writing this review and seeing the smiles on the kids was quite the opposite for us."
3753,3,"Even though it doesn’t look sophisticated it has a tree seeking device implanted in its somewhere I don’t know where, but I’d played a lot of badminton with my kids by the seventh shot this thing up in the tree, okay.So they wouldn’t hit kids says, mommy, I’ll get it down, throw the racket up on the tree. Now your racket is up on the tree; says, don’t worry I’ll get that down. So, now your kid goes into the garage and goes and gets the red rubber ball which should comes as standard equipment in any kind of backyard band – badminton set. Throws that in, that immediately gets impaled. So she goes to get something else to get the – to get one of these things down, okay.Now there are kids from all over the neighborhood that have come into your backyard and they’re – emptying at your garage like throwing stuff at your tree, all right. You realized suddenly you own 18 basketballs, you’ve got 9 footballs, okay they’re softballs flying through the air. The tree is now roaring with children and equipment, all right. Someone’s turned on the hose, badminton is the water sport, they’re trying to get the – this thing down with a hose and somehow mothers from all over the neighborhood hear that badminton is being played at Mary’s house, they’re dropping off their kid, they know it’s not all day affair!, they know what’s this currently involves 17 other sports, they dropping off their kids, they’re leaving skid marks! Okay.You got Coleen Clarke up in the tree trying to get down a Sponge Bob square pants beach ball with a hockey stick, okay. There’s pool sticks flying through the air like javelins and you hear yourself saying, somebody’s going to poke an eye out. It just never ends! It’s of what – everything is going all right. Then you see Christopher Burr and it’s always Christopher Burr. He takes a roller blade, throws it up at the tree, hits your car, you got a dent in your jeep.You realized, you’d better get your jeep out of the way and you also realized that for the first time in seven years you can actually pull your car into the garage, because there is no sporting equipment there anymore. Not even the inflatable raft that hasn’t seen action since the baby duck rescue of 1997.You pull your car into the garage, and as you do your other kids coming out, he is on the phone with RT Murphy, he sizes up the situation says, hey come on over, we’re all playing badminton."
3754,3,"Bottom line, you get what (price) you pay for. I thought (hoped) this would be the bomb when I first got it. While the ""storable portability"" seems like a good idea,(and it COULD BE), the quality and design of this one is C-H-E-A-P. The telescoping poles are a {fragile} pain; the poles don't exactly extend out evenly without contorting the luggage part (the base), and the pins are hard to line-up to pop into the holes. The base of the unit (the luggage) has to be held down by large rocks/bricks to keep it stable. Speaking of the luggage, its not very durable either, just fragile thin vinyl. Also, after 1 year of having this (stored inside thru winter), the piping (red edges) of the net has completely deteriorated(!!!) rendering this useless! I am now desperately trying to find where I can get a replacement net to fit these poles, but none exists(!) I will have to buy a seperate net (as I had to buy seperate shuttlecocks), so ultimately, the raquet is the only part of this set that is a 'keeper'. One final thing, the shuttlecocks that come with this are awful; cheapo plastics that dont really make the game satisfying to play. I had to order some nicer more functional ones. Overall, this may be good for kids to use at a birthday party, but not the long-term quality adults are usually looking for."
3755,3,"Wish I could give a more stars but one of the two sets I ordered had already been used and returned. It was returned with a bent and damaged pole that attaches to the base. I saw this item at a PE conference two weeks ago and couldn't wait to get my students involved. If I allow my high school students to set up and take down already damaged poles I am not sure this product will last. There is so much potential here!!! The idea and concept is great. I use it as an alternative activity for my less intense students.The box of the damaged net is numbered 44 while the other is in the 400's. Before I even brought it to school I made that observation and worried. Once here, I found the damaged end insertion. I plan to use them every other day ... will they last???"
3756,3,"I ordered this badminton set as part of an outdoor summer game station for a children's summer program. The ease of setting up & taking down the net is what attracted me to this item. I opened it for the first time a day ago and it was defective & unusable! One pole had no metal comnector & no holes to connect the poles even if there had been holes! Sadly, I threw the packaging away! Very poor quality!"
3757,3,"I purchased two of these, one as a gift and one for myself. The gift that I gave to my friend broke the first time it was used and mine are already having heavy wear around the extendable arms where they connect to the base with the first use. I like how easily it sets up, but it is difficult to take down. The areas where the extendable net arms clip into the base is difficult to fit the end of the net arms in to the base holes and the removal almost broke the spring clips on both sets because of the amount of pressure needed to get the extendable arms unclipped. The net is not regulation size (20 feet), the net is 11 feet wide, as can be assumed when buying because this is a compact item. The Kit is very light and easy to travel with but blows down easily in light winds which isn't really a problem given it is so easy to lift back up after being knocked down or you can place a heavy item in the bottom to help keep it from blowing over as the instructions suggest. The problem is the thin plastic that the arms are made from allow for a weak area that is not flexible enough to withstand much tension either from the net pulling the arms in toward each other like a bow or the winds causing extra stress and can cause the plastic to break. It needs reinforcement at each joint in the extendable net arms to be a better performing product. Perhaps large pieces of shrink tubing around where the clips of each extendable section connect together and it might be sturdier."
3758,3,"I opened the box to find 2 of the 4 bags not fully sewn together. I chatted with amazon customer service and they are sending me a replacement at no extra cost. +5 stars to amazon customer service. Overall the game is small, but perfect for young children. Will be using it for son's second birthday party. It's made in china and certainly cheaply made, but for $20 it should provide a fun activity for the kids and hold up.Should the replacement also have defective bags, I will post an update."
3759,3,"When I first saw how small it was I was disappointed that they would charged that much for something that is maybe 2 feet. I thought it would be at least 4 feet since you have to throw something at it. I didn't think this was something you would have to throw down at or sit on the floor and throw the squares. The velcro on the squares sticks really well and is made nicely, and my daughter who is 19 months loves it, but I wish it was taller especially for that price."
3760,3,"I really want to give this more stars but, in my opinion, there is a pretty serious design flaw with it.First off, it's a little smaller than you might expect, but that's easy to deal with. The legs support it well and it can take a hit and not fall over. The bean bags are well stitched also and look like they could take a couple years of abuse easily.The problem is the super human strength you need to get the bean bags off the turtle. My three year old isn't strong enough to do it yet and I feel like I'm trying to tear a dish cloth in half when I do it. These bean bags could hold a door on a car. I honestly didn't know velcro could be so strong. As a result I tend to avoid this toy when I'm looking for something to do with my daughter just because her interaction with it it limited and I feel like I'm going to break it."
3761,1,"Not worth the price, very cheaply made.. I can see iron marks from where they ironed the logo on with a household iron. It's super small and not sturdy.. my son tries to take the bean bags off and ends up lifting the whole thing..."
3762,3,"What a cute idea! My daughter loves throw in the bean bags at the turtle. Unfortunately, she lost her balance and fell on the stand. It broke in half. Needless to say, we are disappointed. I now have to find a place to attach it to so it isn't a complete wash. I always love Melissa and Doug products, I just wish the frame of this item would have been made out of something sturdier."
3763,1,"Extremely disappointed in the quality of this product as within just one or two times of use a number have cracked and become deformed. Started with 12, down to just three in less than a month.The DuraFast 40 is the ball of choice for tournaments and I have come to suspect that it is simply for economic reasons between the top tournaments and the brand. Simply put, these balls are terrible, they quickly wear out and do not last at all.Compared to the Onix Pure 2, which is a superior ball that is both durable and consistent, these DuraFast 40 belong in only one place - the trash bin.I certainly do not want to bash the company fulfilling the order as I received the balls quickly and efficiently.I urge all pickleball players to boycott these balls. They are not fun to play with and are complete waste of money."
3764,3,"These are the balls that are used by a lot of the outdoor players that I play with but for some reason this batch of balls are not good. I received this shipment very fast but we used these balls today, 2 of them are cracked already. I don't know why but a friend of mine bought the same balls and had a few of them crack as well. Maybe it's a problem with the Neon green ones because I have had good luck with the yellow ones. Be weary of theses green ones."
3765,3,"It is laughable that the word Dura is short for ""durable"" A 16 ball bag, 5 balls cracked in 3 days of playing. 3 balls were out of round ( very bad as almost all of them are anyway) and I have little hope of the rest lasting much more than another week or two. Yes, I am a 4.5 plus player and hit hard but that is no excuse. The problem with this game and many share the sentiment is this ridiculous ball situation. Whoever donates or bribes their way into sanctioned events have suddenly become the ball of record that month.These balls are fast I give them that. But cracking after a couple of games is unacceptable. ""Dura""...just comical."
3766,3,"A new ball plays well, at least for the majority of your first game. However, typically by game two the balk has lost its shape and will in all likelihood crack prior to games end. I am extremely disappointed in this balls performance. I am equally disappointed that it continues to be sold. I am however most disappointed that this ball has been chosen as the tournament ball for the upcoming US open in Naples Fl. I purchased a dozen and none lasted longer than three games."
3767,3,"We bought these for camping. The horseshoes are a good weight and light enough for kids, but weighty enough for adults to play with as well. However, the red plastic stakes are pretty cheap and when we tried to push them into the ground, they bent, and then we tried to gently pound them in with a rubber mallet and they folded in half and now they can't be used. I think I'll just go to Lowes or HD and get some sort of garden stake instead so we can continue to use the horseshoes."
3768,1,"Let me say that this is a great product as far as durability, design, etc. I gave it 1 star because of a Warning on the box that was covered with a white sticker. When I happened to see it and read it, I found it quite alarming, considering I bought this for my 3 year old. I am returning it as a result.This is the message:WARNING: This Product Contains Chemicals known To The State of California To Cause Cancer and Birth Defects or Other Reproductive Harm."
3769,1,"This product reeks of chemicals! I put it together in my living room, and it smelled up my house, then I saw a warning on the box:""WARNING:This Product Contains Chemicals known ToThe State of California To Cause Cancer andBirth defects or Other Reproductive Harm""!!!!!!When I read that I was PISSED!!! I dismantled it and put it outside on my deck, to keep the CANCER out of my house. I had a bad cough for 4 days afterwards because of the harshness of the odor and from breathing it in. I'm probably going to get lung cancer now! Amazon should not sell this product, they sent it to me in the same box as the baby bottles I had ordered and a book for my 7 month old. I sent them ALL back as I was worried they were contaminated. The nipples smelt like the chemicals."
3770,3,"If this wasn't made of toxic smelling plastic from China it would be great. Officially the worst smelling product I've ever bought. Not a normal plastic smell either. We tried airing them out by leaving them ouside for a few weeks but it's still so bad we can't bring them into the house. We immediately wash our hands after handling them because the smell/chemicals transfers, who knows what we're being exposed to. Unfortunate because the game is a great idea! I thought they might air out but should have returned them."
3771,1,"I should have listened to other negative reviews. When I received the package I knew right away this was a piece of junk. It came in a very small flimsy cardboard box that looked like something out of the Dollar Store. But, I wanted to give my first impression the benefit of the doubt. Well, unfortunately, I wasn't wrong. The flimsy bottom rubber piece you place the plastic pole into is too short to ring the horseshoes around and was bent from being inside the box and wouldn't lay flat. We tried to play anyway and found that every time you got the horseshoe near the pole, it would bounce off or just knock the pole over. This certainly was not worth the cost, even being under $20. Then, I was shocked to find out the packaging indicates ""This product is made with chemicals known to cause cancer in the State of California!...What???!!! A children's toy that is dangerous to play with! The company should be ashamed! I would not recommend. Suppose I am going back to the original way horseshoes are supposed to be made...out of metal."
3772,3,"This product looks good,but actually not. It's hard to remove it on a trampoline. which means that if the hose have no UV resistant, then the price of up to $35 may only be used for a month or even In a few weeks, I should spend an extra $11 to buy a brass sprinkler with UV protection and would not recommend this product to my friends."
3773,3,"I was really hoping for this to work and last; however, the hose broke/burst within minutes of using it for the first time. It seems like this company wants to pride itself on excellent customer service, but that was far from our experience. We tried to turn to the company for some type of resolution to our problem, but there was no adequate response. Overall, this was a pretty terrible experience."
3774,1,Very easy to install! We watched the video and the steup was quick and easy. Only took us about 10 minutes to set up and the kiddos went crazy once we turned it on! Would definitely recommend this to anyone with a trampoline.Edited:The kids have had great fun on this! The only qualm i have is after 3 weeks of use the hose end came off the hose and not really sure how this can be fixed.

3777,3,"The base is made of wood and metal, which is nice. The nuts are not secured to the wood, so it wants to spin when you try to screw the bolts on the pegs. We will be returning because of the chemical odor and ours had been previously opened and returned. Whoever had it completely stripped one of the nuts. I would love to order another one that hasn't been stripped out, but the rope rings just have too strong of a chemical smell."
3778,3,"Cute idea, rings were nice but two of the stakes would not screw in tightly, and when we lifted it, we realized ideas because the threaded piece that was supposed to be glued into the hole was not securely adhered and came off with the stake. Set also did not sit flat. It wobbled (on concrete). If we were needing it for a serious game, this would've gotten even less stars, but luckily it was for a white elephant gift, and the kids ended up playing with it and loving it so the 3rd star is by the skin of its teeth. They may be as to glue the threaded piece back into its hole, and set it in grass and be good to go."
3779,2,"I bought this for a school picnic, box came sealed. Opened box at the picnic, unzipped bag and NO PEGS. This game was useless and kids were disappointed.I should have checked it before I brought to the picnic, but one would assume all the pieces were there in a sealed box.The rope rings are also very scratchy!Would not buy again - returning! Very disappointed"
3780,3,The rings were poky not smooth like it shows in the pictures. My 2 year old did not really want to play with them and when my 10 month old went to grab one he cried because he grabbed a part that poked him. It looked like they were already falling apart when we just opened the package. If the rings were different it would be a great game which is why it got 3 stars.
3781,3,"While I like the design and the set seems pretty durable, the entire thing smelled awful from the moment I opened the box. The strong chemical smell (maybe from the paint or glue) was bad enough to make my head hurt in the short period of time it took to examine the set. I tried airing it out but had no luck. I also contacted the company, but they were no help at all. I'm disappointed since this was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my son; however, there is no way I'd let our family play with something that smells so toxic. I'm returning the set."
3782,3,"Three of the four holders seem to be working fine one of them will not even screw together. This is frustrating as they were intended to be used this weekend to hold drinks during backyard games consisting of teams of two. Now one person is stuck without a drink holder! Overall the construction is ok, somewhat flimsy, but they seem to be sturdy enough to last through a summer."
3783,3,"IF the product pictures were true, I would be inclined to add 2 or 3 stars. As it is, the drink holders that I received are far to big for a 12 oz can, or even a 20 oz Solo cup. It is very difficult to remove a drink once it is placed in the holder. Disappointing. It could be used for a 16 oz (or larger) bottle of water/soda, but holding it rather loosely. There are actual customer pictures showing what I am trying to describe, so give a look in the reviews. I am not satisfied, and may try to return the item."
3784,3,"I love the idea of these drink holders, and used a similar product at my Brother's house for Memorial Day.I got these for when we have people over and play Cornhole in the back yard. I was excited over the price and quality of these.They are very sturdy and well made.Pros: Sturdy solid metal construction with easily detachable (threaded) attachment.Cons: The diameter of the opening is too big. When trying to place a red Solo Cup into these, they sink completely into the holder inside and below the top 'ring' making it very difficult to get your cup out. It works for bottles, but again, the top 'ring' is too big and the bottles flop around."
3785,3,"They aren't bad for what they are, but a friend of mine has solid, 1-piece drink holders that are a little better. I get the appeal of having two pieces for easier storage, but even though the pieces threaded together nicely they all have a slight bend to them. The metal itself is not bent, but where they screw together it doesn't maintain a perfectly straight rod from top to bottom, so I have to either angle the bottom into the ground or be okay with the drink being somewhat tilted."
3786,3,"These are a great idea and although the picture is inaccurate (the size of the holder is really too big for a soda can to sit in it the way it is depicted) It still works pretty well for a variety of sizes of drinks. We use them when we go camping. We have benches and chairs around a permanent fire pit, but no place to put our drinks. The down side is they are a bit flimsy and are easily bent when placing in the ground, so handle with some care. Once in, they do stay up rather well and hold a fair amount of weight (large water bottle, wine bottle, etc)."
3787,3,"In general, I like this set, but it has a couple of negatives:1. The bean bags are ""lighter weight"" than standard corn hole bags...and that is because...2. The boards themselves cannot support the weight of standard corn hole bags beating against them. We have some standard bags and the boards do not seem to tolerate them well.3. The bean bags are made from a slick, satin-like fabric...and one of ours is coming apart after only a couple days of use.4. The boards are so lightweight and do not have proper [rubber] footing, so they do not stay put...at least on non-carpeted flooring.I wish I had invested in a sturdier set."
3788,2,"I bought this in hopes I could pack it up and take it places. The boards do not stay together to do that. They are constantly falling apart and you lose the bean bags. Also the legs are super flimsy and don't hold up well. The board is also extremely slippery and I don't think the slope is correct so almost always the bags fly right off. I should have spent the extra money on a better set. This is a definite you get what you pay for and trying to go a little cheaper wasn't worth it. I compared it by having a better set (someone else's set) next to this one and had the same people tossing the bean bags, and the other set held them much better. Also the little kids always love to play this at picnics and its too frustrating for them even standing closer to the board because everything slips so easily. I guess if you want a real tough version of the game this is for you, but don't expect to take it everywhere you go."
3789,1,"Better off making one yourself. Yes, the graphics are nice but that's about it. Not worth the money at all.The cheapest wood possible is used throughout. And it's heavy to boot. The legs that hold it up are the worst part.There is maybe $20 of wood and materials, tops used in the product. It's basically junk with pretty graphics. I'm keeping ours I think and changing the legs. They barely hold up this game and I guarantee you they will break first and soon.This is a cheaply made board. I can't recommend it. I have wood tools and would make one but needed the game quick for a party... sorry I made the purchase."
3790,2,I am starting a business and hadn't opened these yet (winter in Michigan). I just did and discovered that 2 out of 3 of the games are damaged. I am not happy. Apparently I missed the return by date by about 12 days but I am going to try to return them. Not durable and it doesn't help that they aren't packaged well at all.
3791,3,"Love the game and board is good quality. However we didnt use it until about two weeks after receiving. One of the bean bags frayed on the edges in the middle of the seam the first time we played with it. Another bag frayed the whole length of one side. I tried to find a place to contact the seller but I either overlooked that or info wasnt there. I prefer to contact the seller and give them an opportunity to make it right rather than leave a negative review. Since i couldnt contact the seller, im leaving a negative review which i will change if seller will replace the two defective bags."
3792,3,The little fishing poles are cute and work okay. The fish and other sea creatures do not connect to the magnet. The magnet on the fish and sea creatures are small little dots on their noses. I haven't figured out where the magnet is on the fishing hook thing. Since this is for a one time party I'll make it work even if I use clothes pins.
3793,3,"I haven't given this to my granddaughter for her birthday yet, but I was shocked at how tiny the magnets are. The other reviewers here are hopefully legit and saying their children can play with this easily. I'm hoping it true. I'm tempted to return it and buy something else considering the magnets on both the pole and the fish are smaller than the size of a pea. Not sure my 3 year old will be able to catch anything. Hope it's not too frustrating for her. She asked for a fishing pole for her birthday since we read so many stories with characters who go fishing."
3794,3,"A heads up for customers leaving less than a 5-star review for this game -The seller went outside the Amazon system to my business website and submitted a rambling message. They requested that I revise my review and rating so that I did not “kill [their] dream.” I hesitated before giving 3 stars because the product looks and feels cheap and 2 stars is more accurate. Contacting me at my business to guilt me into changing my review? Zero stars. You’re killing your own dream.We've had various fishing sets at our pediatric therapy clinic. From the photo and description, I liked that this set included nets and multiple fish. I didn't expect it to include a duck or sea turtle. I had to explain to a preschooler today why a baby sea turtle was used as bait. The plastic looks/feels cheap. The poles worked OK, but the magnetic design could be improved. The magnets and screws are very small."
3795,1,"I’m not really sure how the reviews are so high but this fish set is poor quality and a choking hazard. #1 the metal piece in each fish that the magnet attaches to is a very small SCREW, hence if it fell out would be a choking hazard. #2 there are small yellow circles down the poles that the string goes through that are not glued on, they constantly pop off and are annoying to have to constantly put back on, and another choking hazard. #3 the plastic is thin hollow and not hard or durable. In the first day one of the fish was dented and the pole snapped just from light play. I’m returning this item, I’m very disappointed. I would not recommend this be around any young children due to the choking hazard."
3796,2,"I have bought 2 laptops in the past 2 years from Acer. They are the only Acer products I have ever bought, and they are the only ones I will ever buy. The first was a Helios 300. Though their service professionals are amiable enough their ability to help is hamstrung by Acer's policies. The only recourse anyone ever has with their product is to ship it in to their repair centers where the the initial level of diagnostics is totally insufficient. My first laptop had a motherboard problem but they sent it back to me without repair. The problem persisted and they had to elevate my problem to someone who actually sounded like they knew anything about computers. I finally got a usable computer a full month and half after I ordered which makes one ask if I should even both with Amazon's 2-day shipping. The second laptop has a bad HDD. I KNOW it's a bad HDD. I've confirmed it in several different ways and just want to replace the HDD. I'm overseas and sending it in will cost more than the laptop is worth, but does that matter? Nope. Will the service representative refer me to a supervisor? Nope. Their ONLY recourse they're allowed is send it in. If you won't send it in, we won't do anything about the bad HDD we gave you. If you get a functional laptop you probably will never have to deal with these folks, but I'm batting a 1000 on Acer products here with failed hardware shipped in them. Either I'm extremely unlucky, or Acer's quality control is the worst I've ever seen."
3797,2,"I set my expectations low with the price point of this laptop, but expected it to function at the very least. Unfortunately it cannot. It’s incredibly slow, which isn’t a big deal, expected at $360, but it will not update. I cannot get windows to update. I had it downloading updates for 5 hours and the final download wouldn’t pass 6% even after sitting for over an hour for this download alone. If you use the internet at all do not purchase this. Web pages take a while to load, or won’t load completely, regardless of browser. Meanwhile I hop on my desktop, phone, any other device and the internet works flawless so I know my internet is fine. Went through and updated all the drivers without any success. Videos won’t load either. Yeah, the screen is 1080p, but if you try to watch a random youtube video at just 720p, it cannot go more than 5-10 seconds without buffering for 3-4x that amount. I tried resetting the laptop and have spent hours attempting to make this work. Maybe a defective model, but something is definitely wrong. My old HP Pavilion that was 5 years old worked better. If you purchase this laptop make sure you have a smartphone or something so you can watch youtube videos to bypass the wait of loading your favourite homepage or email.Aside from all of the cons, the battery life seems decent. Probably because the computer is barely functional and the battery is quite literally just powering the screen. I think the HDD takes a nap or something once it wears itself out from starting up.Touchpad is okay, fairly responsive, comfortable to use. This is definitely a place where you feel what you paid for, same goes for the keyboard.Keyboard is okay, Caps Lock doesn’t light up or anything so it always keeps you guessing when entering passwords for online accounts. Who knew logging into websites could be a fun game! Nonetheless the keyboard feels cheap as to be expected.Picture quality is decent. If videos would load i’m sure the laptop wouldn’t be too bad for simple tasks, using word, very light internet surfing, staring at your 240 I mean 1080p background picture.Startup is slow, even after removing the bloatware, resetting windows, I can still cook myself dinner and by the time i’ve finished I can finally log into my dinosaur er I mean laptop.I was going to install an SSD but alas I can’t help but feel it would be a wasted effort. No point in putting a fresh heart into a dying body.Sound quality, I shouldn’t even have to address this. Its a laptop, they shouldn’t even come with internal speakers at this point. Buy an externet speaker set. I got an Amazon Basics set 4 or so years ago and they work pretty well. Not perfect, but a huge upgrade for $15.Overall feels worth it for ~$360 if you receive a working model. Acer needs to either up their QC or address some defects. Maybe the defective models simply get routed right back with the working ones and shipped out. Who knows."
3798,3,"I hesitate to leave such a horrible review but it has been a 5 day nightmare for me and it does't seem to be over yet. The browser would close on its own and open a random window that I did not open. I heard myself talking through the laptop speakers and looked behind the window I had open and was staring back at myself because the computer had opened Skype all by itself. Suddenly, I couldn't open any items on the desktop. The cursor would move but clicking on items wouldn't open them. It wouldn't type into the search bar, and the Windows Icon (far bottom left) wouldn't open to allow me to reboot. I had to force reboot by holding the power button (which I hate to do). Then, the ""restarting"" wheel just swirled and swirled... When I tried to backup my files by plugging in my external hard drive, it recognized it okay and opened the window to show the files, while I was looking it, it suddenly closed that window and opened another window. Then, while transferring files from the laptop to the external drive, I started getting the message, ""Are you sure you want to save this file without its properties""? WTH? Also, when I clicked the Windows Icon (lower left) that opens to show the programs in alphabetic order, suddenly before my eyes, all names and icons of the programs disappeared and a random alphabet appears... A B C D etc with no names or icons. But, when I clicked the Windows Icon again, it all came back. It literally felt like there was a ghost in the laptop or someone was controlling it from elsewhere. I have been on the phone with Amazon, Acer, and even Microsoft Windows. I had already spent two days re-installing all my files and software (winzip, video editing software, Microsoft Word, Norton) only to ultimately restore Windows to factory settings while on the phone with Microsoft. This is when the problem occurred while trying to backup my files to the external drive... which caused me to fear that my external device was now corrupted. That device held 8 years of research with documents and images I had created. It held the backup of 4 books I had written, the family tree book I had been working on since 2012, and all our ancestors photos I had restores and only I had this family data. I had my wedding photos and photos of my deceased mother who just passed and my deceased brother who died in 1976 in a car accident, my daughter's baby pictures... So, I was horrified when I plugged the drive in after the factory restore and got the message that the external drive was not recognized. Thankfully! Thankfully! My brother helped me retrieve my data from it. I had bought my husband the exact same laptop but from another vendor and his didn't have these problems. The seal on my laptop had not been broken but Amazon customer service had said, ""So, you bought this on Nov 14th"". No... I bought it on Nov 29th. Then she said, ""No problem, I'll just change that for you"". Which makes me wonder what happened between Nov 14th and the 29th? A fluke? Last night around 1am, my Kindle starts alerting me of Yahoo email login failures and something about failures to log into Amazon through my Yahoo email. This is a full 5 days after this all started. So, at 2 am I up changing all my passwords to every account I own; my bank, Paypal, Amazon, Yahoo email... etc'. I have demanded that Acer investigate by tracing the laptop though its SN number but am told they can't do that. It is their responsibility to ensure that their customer receive a clean computer. I have been emotionally exhausted, emotionally distraught, mentally exhausted and physically exhausted and I shouldn't have had to go through this. Customers should't have to restore their laptop Windows back to factory settings. But, my husband's laptop was fine. Somebody, somewhere, did something to the laptop I received and I feel it should be investigated. Maybe this feedback will make that happen. Or, maybe they will just come after me instead. That would be a lot easier than tracing where their corrupted laptop came from."
3799,3,"Summary:Computer sits at 100% disk usage for a majority of it's operation, even with no applications running. This causes it to be so slow it is unusable.I have built a couple of computers previously, work as an IT Consultant, and generally am decently technologically savvy when it comes to computers. The specs on this computer seemed pretty decent for the price, but the performance is terrible. None of the 100% disk usage fixes worked.The computer sits at 100% disk usage, possibly dropping down to 99% disk usage, before jumping back up to 100%. This occurs even if the only application open is Task Manager to monitor the disk usage. I have had 4 different computers, 3 of them laptops, running windows 10 before and never run into this issue. After doing some research, it looks like this isn't an unheard of issue with multiple guides and reddits discussing the problem. I tried everything I could find, from disabling the WPR system collector, turning off windows search, turning off superfetch, running Check Disk, resetting the virtual memory, etc. No solutions worked. I contacted Acer feeling defeated I was unable to fix it. My thought was that it was probably a hardware issue at this point. Acer wanted me to run through all the same fixes, so I did. Then they wanted me to create a windows boot drive and try with a fresh, clean install. I did that too, without success. When I contacted them again, they wanted me to ship the computer to them to fix. Unfortunately the shipping cost isn't included. At this point I've been trying to get this computer working like it should have out of the box for several months. I'll have to pay more for them to potentially fix it. I think it would make more sense to just invest in a ssd upgrade for it and see if that solves the issue, since it seems to be solely the hard drive that is failing. If that works I'll probably skip the repair time/costs. Haven't had a good experience with this computer. Out of the gate if you just buy a ssd that might be a better experience for you. Best of luck. If you don't need a mobile computer, build a desktop. Best bang for the buck every time and you know exactly what is in it."
3800,1,"I bought this May 15, 2018 based on reviews. It stopped working yesterday, rather started working strangely. Today I called for tech support only to find the warranty expired at 6 months. The tech support person was kind and knowledgeable but did not tell me that my service expired until he found what he said was corrupted data and that he would be able to fix the data if the for a fee of $129 for a year other options for 2 and 3 years at higher rates. I decided I wanted to get a second opinion and took it to a local computer shop who told me that the hard drive was bad. The cost of a new hard drive, reinstall the operating system, recover my data files and transfer to the new hard drive was quoted just under the total amount I paid for the computer at $379. The hard drive going bad at 7 months, I am very disappointed and disturbed.Up until the hard drive failure, I really enjoyed my Acer. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this computer."
3801,3," I received my Macbook Air really fast and I was happy at first but after using it for one day I realized the screen wasn't working properly on Full Screen mode. It was cutting the image in half and kept popping on the sides. I am super disappointed and I have to return it.I think those computers are not really certified refurbished, and refurbished is supposed to mean that they check that everything works well.I always buy my electronics products refurbished and it is the first time I have an issue."
3802,3,"When I received this package, I was thrilled...until I tried to turn it on and got a “low battery” notification...for 16+ hours. Turns out the cord provided (not a Mac product) is not the correct wattage to charge this device. It’s hard to tell at this point if the computer is faulty or not now that I’ve purchased a new cord from Best Buy, but it shuts down as soon as it’s disconnected from power. The screen is pretty floppy, too- falls back without provocation. All of which seem like things that should have been mentioned in the details before I decided to purchase.After taking this computer to the Apple store, I was informed that the issue was indeed the battery- completely bad and had to be replaced. Again, something that I wish I had known before purchasing. It is in working order now, but doesn’t meet my standards of what “certified refurbished” means, and product details lacking for sufficient purchasing knowledge ahead of time."
3803,3,"It said I had to do an update. When I hit the only update allowed it said the latest version was already installed but it wouldn’t let me go foward. Also the screen seemed loose. So if it was cleared out they never installed the new software correctly. So it wouldn’t let me even get to the main screen. Others had luck but I did not.Also when I plugged the power bar in. It had a bit of a shock come out. As an electrician, I know that was a big no no. I was willing to spend the money and get the correct power cord. But with everything else. I thought that’s already 3 strikes. No thanks."
3804,3,"I bought this Mac and it came with a non Apple charger, I bought this as travel computer, sure enough in the first week while I was in Europe I had to buy am authentic Apple charger at $117. Now a month later my Mac has died. It was having issues as in when I tried to maximize the scene with Netflix it would just shrink to a 3x5"" screen volume, also the screen had been replaced before I bought it and is not well attached, very disappointed, I bought this last summer, but only started to use it in October when I was traveling, so I spent close to $700 for a Mac that lasted 2 months, return and replacement window has ""closed"" so I am stuck with a hefty repair bill."
3805,2,I have been struggling with this product since day one. I am not getting responses from the seller OR the extended warranty repair company.I have never had trouble with Amazon before. Every issue I have ever had has been settled with ease and courtesy.This has not. Made more devastating as it it is the largest purchase I have had and the product has been unusable almost since day one. We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesn’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional. To repair it would cost more than I paid. They do not think that the parts it was refurbished with are even Apple parts.This was a terrible product and not worth the money.
3806,3,"I originally purchased this at the beginning of April after about a week it stopped charging (would receive ""low power charger"" connected message and not charge). Tried the troubleshooting steps...hard reset (refresh+power), left it plugged in, left it unplugged, etc, but couldn't get it to charge. Tried the charger with other devices and it worked fine. I ended up returning it. I decided to try for another one, which I received towards the end of April. After about a week, ran into the same exact issue, and tried the same exact remedies as above (that have been recommended on here and elsewhere). Still wouldn't charge. And now this one is being returned. After reading through the comments I see that this issue is occurring for a lot of other people as well. Is this a known defect that ASUS refuses to acknowledge? I know that they have been replying to comments on here to send it in for repair but that almost seems like they knew this was going to be an issue and prepared themselves to receive numerous units to repair. Thankfully for both of these purchases I was still within the return period and was able to send back to Amazon (considering in both cases they stopped charging quickly). But that doesn't leave me with much confidence in ASUS and a highly rated Chromebook that was supposed to be ""one of the best"", especially when I found myself with the same issue on the same model...twice."
3807,1,"I purchased the C302A from Amazon last summer. When it worked correctly it's a great machine. I think the Chrome OS is plenty powerful and versatile enough for the vast majority of users, perhaps as much as 95 percent. I am a writer-researcher and there was nothing that I did on my old Windows machines that I couldn't do on the C302a. The hardware which would be middling at best on a Windows laptop was very fast on a Chromebook.Then in February, I began to have persistent audio problems that required me to shut down and restart the C302a multiple times a day. I contact ASUS and they issued an RMA and I sent the machine to ASUS for repair. I got it back about 2 weeks later and within an hour the problem began all over again. I contacted ASUS, got another RMA, sent it back and got it back yet another two weeks later. Nothing had changed.This time, the ASUS rep told me to send it back for exchange. That's when the fun started. I did as requested and heard nothing from ASUS. Previously, they had sent me emails acknowledging their receipt of the machine. This time, crickets. I checked FedEx which confirmed that ASUS had received the package. When I called I was told that they were awaiting my response to an email giving a choice between several possible replacements. No such email had been sent, much less received. I finally got to speak to a supervisor who called me the next day who confirmed that no such email had been sent and that what was actually happening was that they were waiting for a suitable replacement to be available -- someone else's problem child -- so that they could recondition it and send it to me.Now, I wasn't crazy about getting someone else's problem but that's all that was on offer. Yet ASUS screwed this up, too. They never got back to me and when I called we were back to the ""we're awaiting your response to our email"" version of events. What's more, when I called their support number again, I got a message saying that they were closed and to call back during regular business hours. At 12:30 p.m. EDT.Yet another supervisor -- I got through by calling sales and insisting on being transferred to support -- on the ""escalation team"" repeated the ""we're awaiting a used C302a we can foist on you"" (albeit not in those exact words) along with a promise that yet another supervisor would call me the next day which she did. And these were the exact words I was told ""[Your replacement] is currently in the process of being shipped with a replacement unit of the same model. Once the replacement unit has been reserved for your RMA, the replacement will be shipped to the address below.""""In the process"" could mean ""forging the aluminum needed to make the case which will then be assembled into and sold to someone else and then returned.""As of today, I have no idea of when or even whether I will receive a replacement from ASUS, much less whether that replacement will be any good. I'm out nearly $500 with little recourse against ASUS.Avoid ASUS like the plague. They do not stand behind their products.Update:it has been several weeks since I posted this review and nothing has changed. Actually, that's not true. Asus has managed to add insult to injury. Twice. I called Asus to inquire as to the status yet again. Yet again, I was transferred to a supervisor who promised to ""escalate"" the matter despite my protests that this matter had been elevated so many times that it was halfway to the moon by now. It was all he could do. That and a promise that someone would contact me within 24-48 hours, Needless to say at this point, that didn't happen.The second insult was here at Amazon. After my initial post, someone from Asus ""customer loyalty"" added a comment insisting that this experience was atypical and violative of the company's standards and asked me to contact him or her so that they could help. I sent an email with the details. As if to prove my point, I haven't heard back from them.It's almost as if they are trolling their customers.Update 2I finally got my computer back. After I posted the previous update, the ASUS representative emailed me and reiterated that he/she had contacted ASUS and told them to make my case a priority. Given my previous experience, I was skeptical. But a few days later I received an email from FedEx telling me that a package from ASUS was on its way.The replacement came in a box that gave no indication whether it was new or refurbished. In any case, it looks like new and works very well.So, does this change my rating? As I said earlier, if you like Chrome OS, and I do, this is a great laptop. It's fast and has a great screen and keyboard. It's not as loaded as the Pixelbook or even the top-of-the-line Samsung, but it cost less than half as much as the former and hundreds less than the latter. Its build quality is easily comparable to both.So the machine itself is a 5-star laptop.Unfortunately, my customer service experience was abysmal. It was only ""resolved"" because I made a nuisance of myself by posting here on Amazon. I believe that if I hadn't taken a step that I find personally distasteful, ASUS wouldn't have responded. If it were possible to assign a sub-zero-star rating for customer service, I would.So, should you get it? Only if you know that there's a chance of an experience like mine and that of several other raters. Perhaps buyng a used or already furbished one with a Square Trade warranty is the best way to go."
3808,1,"I was SO excited to buy the ASUS Chromebook, as I have had 2 other Samsung Chromebooks, and bought some for my grandchildren. But this Asus, who offered SO much & rated over 4 stars, turned to a black screen, just over a month after I received it. Lo and behold, I hadn't read quite ALL of the 1* reviews: the worst was a teacher who had ordered so many for her several classes and said "" I think the problem is with the motherboard. If you hold it just right, and don't move it, it works fine."" She's trying to figure out what to do. That made my decision to return it & NOT replace it. Too many have tried to fix it, only to not get it back months later, and then have it break AGAIN, when it was no longer under warranty. Thank you helping me though this Amazon. Asus, has a horrible reputation. Read ALL the reviews~."
3809,2,"I purchased this notebook back in July and was initially happy with my purchase. However, after a couple of months the keyboard case started to crack at the corner. I contacted customer service and was told to send the notebook to the repair center where it would be repaired under Warranty. 2 weeks later I received an email informing me the crack was not covered under warranty, and I would need to pay $183. After numerous calls, I then received confirmation the warranty was valid, but only as a ‘one-off’. 2 more weeks go by, and the repair status still shows as ‘in repair’. I called customer service again and was told the issue would be escalated. Another week goes by and still no change. I call again and was told the issue would be escalated again. I asked for the notebook just to be returned as is, and was told that’s not possible as it’s ‘in repair’. In summary, I have been without this device for over a month, have no idea if and when it will be returned, and in what condition.Day 29 since Asus received my notebook. Still no update, status, supervisor escalation. ‘Bot response to review requested RMA # which was provided same day, but no follow up.Day 33 - Got same email / escalation from customer service but still no ETA, status, evidence of escalation or Notebook!Day 42 - Finally received repaired Notebook.Update - 7/30/18 - Exactly the same issue has occurred with a crack in the keyboard cover on the opposite side. This Chromebook has not been dropped or treated roughly so I can only assume this is a design or manufacturing defect. I have been informed by Asus Customer Service that I would need to return the device (again), and the repair would cost an estimated $210!!!This device would be a good choice if it weren't so poorly constructed. Now looking elsewhere for a reliable Chromebook."
3810,3,"Great machine out of the box... BUT after only a couple of days the thing just turned off and won't turn back on again... I tired every remedy found online, and even got in touch with Asus tech support who just said ""send it back""... This seems to be a somewhat common issue with Chromebooks but this Asus model doesn't have a way to preform an external reset, which is a big problem if you've setup any personal info on it and it has to be sent back. AND apparently Amazon is experiencing a supply shortage because my replacement isn't expected until sometime between Jan 11th to Feb 5th! I purchased this for a Christmas gift (bought on Nov 28th and received Dec 7th) and so next month, or maybe even the next is totally unacceptable... Everything (covers, etc...) is going back in efforts to find something that works before Christmas... I don't usually leave bad reviews and I totally get supply issues, but after searching online, I found that these things seem to have tendencies towards intermittent power issues (battery not charging, etc.. and this one in particular has no way to reset...) I wish I would have known that BEFORE buying..."
3811,2,"Upon receiving my Azpen Innovations A746 tablet to test (which by the way arrived VERY quickly), I noticed that it resembled the Kindle Fire that I bought my wife a few years ago. I was surprised to find out that the battery was already charged, and came with a wall plug, a laptop charging cable, and another cable that I assume also charges the tablet with a different connector. On the flip side, the screen protector that came with its first label did not come completely off, so I could not use it.Now, I am an iOS guy and not much of an Android fan, so I knew that the operating system would have a learning curve for me. It did not take me as long to learn how the OS worked as I thought it would, but there was a moment where I had to do some poking and prodding to undo a folder that I mistakenly created. The tablet also did not adjust to the proper time zone once I got it up and running, and I had to do the digging to find out how to fix it. I was able to get the Wi-Fi connected very easily so I could really start to get my hands dirty.Once I was able to log in with my Google credentials, I started downloading apps and found it easy and quick to get them going, including a podcast app that made it easy to find the podcasts that I like to listen to. The interface can tend to drag a bit when I get into the apps, but I have seen worse.The 7” screen works very well, sizing the icons in a fashion that doesn’t make me squint to find all of my icons. I did find it a bit frustrating in selecting certain places on the screen that were unresponsive and required me to have almost pinpoint accuracy to get where I wanted to go. Also, the “On/Off” switches are not as responsive as I would like them to be. There were times on unboxing where I had to back out and go back into a screen to get the switch to work.I logged into my Facebook account and began to browse. The icons were a bit small in this case and they were tough to click where I needed them to. During my browsing, I got a private message from a friend of mine, and replying to him on the on-screen keyboard got a bit bulky in both landscape and portrait modes. Perhaps this will be easier to work with when connected to a Bluetooth keyboard.The touch screen is a bit slow in response as I scroll through apps, but the quality of pictures seems to be pretty good. I am impressed with the resistance of the screen to keep my fingerprints at a minimum. Video play is a bit grainy and pixelated, which is surprising for a screen as small as this, and the speaker that is built in is not as loud as it should be.I do like the fact that I can add to its storage capacity and plan on doing so in the near future so that I can work with the music features and find out how that works.The real test here lies in the opinions of my wife. She tends to be a bit picky when it comes to technology, even though she tends to just do social media and the games therein. She was really wowed at first as she checked out some of the features, but that faded as she loaded her Dragon Vale game only to find out that it would not get past the splash page, even after she deleted and reloaded the app. She also felt the video quality was a bit grainy and slow.Overall, this would be a great tablet for kids to play with, but I am not sure that I would use it as an everyday piece of equipment. I plan on using it as a remote with a new home theater system I am designing very soon and feel like it will truly serve its purpose there."
3812,3,"This tablet seemed to work fine for the first two or three days but we have had it only a week and it will not turn on! It gets to the azpen screen and just stays there. We have restarted it, let the battery run out and still nothing. We got this for my son to play games on and it only had two games on it, so I can't say that it was being worked very hard. If there is another way to get it to restart please let me know,other wise I am now in the market for another tablet. Again. Really not happy."
3813,1,"My mom bought these for my kids for Christmas next week. I've been trying to even connect to our wifi. It connects with no internet. Then, it randomly shuts off. Not sleep mode. just in trying to log in to Wifi the battery drained too quickly. My mom spent a lot on these through Shopko and now I have to wait for the return to go through before she can order something else forher grandkids. This is the worst, crappiest tech. Save yourself a headache and buy a quality name brand."
3814,3,"I was prepared for this to be a low performance device, and I was okay with that. However, I was not prepared for the touch screen to be so poorly mapped that it was impossible to type the number 3. I could get 2 and 4 all day long, but no 3, and no work-around that I could think of would fix it.Since there's a 3 in my wifi password, this tablet's time in my life was short. I put it right back in its box and started the return. The Fire with ads is absolutely worth the few bucks more."
3815,2,"I just requested a return lable for this tablet. I was very disappointed, especially after reading the reviews, expected a better quality tablet. Maybe I am spoiled by my first generation Kindle Fire, but this tablet was so frustration. It took forever for stuff to load, and the wifi fell out constantly. Never had this problem with the Kindle Fire, laptop,nor smartphone. Over and over again, I would have to reconnect to wifi. the screen, as notated in several comments was very washed out. I tried to log into the blio e-reader account several times, but was told it was either down, or moved, so much for e-books."
3816,3,"I fully expected to give this tablet a good review but that definitely is not going to happen.While the Hi9 apparently does have a maximum 10 core processor it is normally just utilizing 1 or 2 of those cores so the UI is way less smooth than it should be--it's actually significantly less smooth than the far less powerful Fire 10 Tablet. The Hi9 does play every game that I have tried fine but it makes no sense to leave almost all of the processing power dormant when you are scrolling in an app or surfing the internet or doing other mundane tasks. Cores are useless if the device isn't taking advantage of them.The display is bright and colorful but it feels like there is virtually no oleophobic coating--the glass isn't as slick to the touch as it should be and attracts fingerprints and smudges like crazy that are way more difficult to wipe off with a soft cloth than they should be. But the Hi9 is pretty inexpensive and that's the most obvious area where corners were cut. Otherwise, the build quality seems pretty solid for the price.The Chuwi Hi9 comes with Google Play and seems at first to be running a very clean version of Android. The only odd thing I initially noticed was that the standard Settings/System/System Update menu doesn't actually update the OS. When I turned on my Hi9 it was running old software and System Update showed no updates available. But if you click About Tablet instead of System Update there is a selection called Wireless Update that actually does update the OS.The tablet updated the OS twice (which includes rebooting to do the actual install) before I installed any of my own apps. When it showed a third update something didn't seem right because the package date was older than the date for the second OTA and Android doesn't update backward.It turned out there was something very wrong with the third OTA update--it installed com.adups.fota and com.adups.fota.sysoper which is a notorious malicious app that can not only spy on anything you do with your Android device and send the information to servers in China but can also install any app that it wants without your knowledge or control. Since it installs as part of an official OTA the malware has elevated system rights, is virtually impossible for the user to uninstall unless the device is rooted and doesn't show up in Malwarebytes or Google Play Protect as being malicious--although the Malwarebytes website explains that the app is definitely considered malicious and offers possible ways to disable or temporarily uninstall it.Com.adups.fota also hijacked the legitimate Wireless Update app making it impossible to update the Hi9 OS through normal means.Keep in mind that all of this happened before I installed a single app of my own on the tablet.After several hours of research, I found out how to flash a clean stock system image which did get rid of the malware--but unless I root the tablet and install a different OS there is no way for me to prevent the malware from being installed again.To give this review further perspective, I should mention that I currently own two Huawei smartphones (P20 Pro and Mate 20 Pro) and one Xiaomi smartphone (Mix 2S) so I am not a Trump nutjob who is paranoid about using Chinese electronics. This specific malware only shows up on budget Chinese smartphones (like those from Blu)--and apparently, budget Chinese tablets.I'm not sure if I am going to keep this tablet or return it but I am certain that I couldn't recommend buying a Chuwi Hi9 unless you are familiar with rooting and flashing on Android devices and know what you are possibly getting into. I didn't purchase my tablet from a third party seller either--I ordered it directly from Amazon and the seller was supposed to be Chuwi, the actual company that makes the tablet.Update: Chuwi released a new ROM build on 11/22/18 that some people say has not reinstalled com.adups.fota onto their tablets. The new build also improves CPU management slightly--my tablet is now using 2-3 cores for basic tasks instead of just 1-2 but in terms of overall UI smoothness there is still a lot of room for improvement. The bigger problem is that com.adups.fota blocks the Hi9 from being able to see any OTA updates so Hi9 owners without technical knowledge will not be able to update their tablets."
3817,1,"Overall, the tablet is decent, but they chose to use a cheap USB port, which becomes loose very quickly and will require you hold the cable in just the right position to charge it. After a few months, you will have to hold it by hand to charge it.If CHUWI responded to emails and honored their warranty, this would have been a decent purchase, but they don't and I bought this to take on a trip that meant I got home after the return window was closed. I have emailed and used their web form to no avail, and will likely have to solder on a new port on my own. Unless you, too are an engineer, don't buy this company's products!"
3818,3,"This seemed like a very nice affordable tablet, which is why I bought it, but after about a week of use it started to randomly shut off and reboot. - Not fun anymore for my son who had to put up with it! Besides that, I discovered it wants you to click on ""wireless update"" a couple of times which upgrades the Android security patch to June, 2018 (a good thing), but it also adds some ""fota....."" software (which is unremovable). After researching this, I found that the US banned cell phones being sold here with this software, saying it was a type of spyware into customer usage data....etc. I did a factory reboot (which actually keeps the June security update), but removed the ""fota"" software. Couldn't figure out how to stop the frequent reboots, though. Response from Chuwi was to perform some sort of flash. From my point of view, this is a brand new tablet that shouldn't need a flash - it should work flawlessly for quite a bit of time. So I returned it to Amazon and bought a better known tablet - it was more money, but better peace of mind."
3819,3,"No screen access and locked up after I loaded a couple of games, couldn't get my information off so I wrote the company, here is what I got back;""1)do not play the Large-scale game when you use the laptop,that will give the motherboard too much stress2)Don't open several apps at the same time,It had better not use when the laptop get charge3) If you wear a casing for your tablet ,we suggest that you take off itthe fashionable tablet cases are insulating the back of the device,also due to overheating""Had to run the battery out over a couple of days, then it started OK and I reset it and sent it back!"
3820,1,"This tablet looks and runs great... if but for a few problems this thing would be awesome. Unfortunately I could not recommend this tablet at all.The BAD:First it wants to constantly update and install malware. Honestly this is minor for me and can be managed but lets be honest, it shouldn't happen.Second it constantly reboots and changes mac address. This is very annoying because I have to keep adding the new mac address everyday to my account on my network!!! This is a real pain in the arse! Everything on my network has certain privileges so I can monitor and keep kids safe. Because this thing changes mac address it appears to be a new device. This is a nightmare and a major deal breaker!The last issue I take with this tablet is the very cheap piece of garbage charging port that everyone (I guess I should say every ""REAL"" reviewer) has issue with. The port immediately became loose and doesn't work unless you hold it just right... I have figured a way to stand it up against a wall so it charges which keeps me from having to hold it...The GOOD:Yes there is a lot of good with the tablet but it is sooooooo overshadowed! The picture is beautiful, the power and speed is great and everything runs well.I would have paid double if the port wasn't garbage and the damn thing didn't change MAC address multiple times per day... Honestly the updates and malware is manageable but those other hardware issues are unacceptable! I honestly do not not take the time to review products unless it is very good or very poor... I so wanted to give this 5 stars but would give it less than 1 if i could. If they would fix the 2 hardware issues i would definitely revisit this review."
3821,3,"Got this pc for my 12 year old grandson. It did a good job with the games he played, good response and graphics. The only problem, the computer failed within one week. The computer no longer powers on. It appears that the box may run hot and this might cause the power control or power supply to fail. The only option is to ship it back to Cyberpower at your own expense and then pray the repaired box doesn't fail again after one week. Also the shipping carton leaves a lot to be desired. There is no protective packaging around the pc, just the thin outer cardboard box."
3822,3,"Doesn't work. Dead on arrival. Yes I plugged it in, thanks for asking me tech support. Got new chords , opened up inside checked all connections. Power comes on, nothing loads up. Total junk. If you dont want to deal with a nightmare , then buy a more reputable brand.Update... finally got it working. Had to spend a lot of time rechecking all the wiring inside.Worked fine for a day, then suddenly in the middle of a game the screen went black with a white line across it. Now totally dead. Monitor is fine with other computer so definitely the computer itself is defective."
3823,1,"I’m guessing i’m in the minority with the defective units. Bought it April 22nd, came in a few days later. Unboxed it, was astounded about how beautiful and vibrant the LED’s are. The PC itself looks really nice and have some good components within for the price. Anyways, after setup, the PC constantly crashed with too many different codes to count. I was extremely disappointed with the product. I contacted CyberPower Tech support and that’s where I messed up. They were no help whatsoever. They were clueless. They refused to ship me a new PC since it wasn’t “in policy”. I spent 800 dollars for this garbage and it never worked. If it worked, I would’ve been happy! Sadly, that’s nit the case.If you do buy, I hope you don’t get one of the defective units. If so, Amazon refund, do not even try to go through CyberPower."
3824,3,"Everything seemed fine when we unboxed the unit, which was well packed. The system booted right up, but my son got a blue screen error after attempting downloads. The system would reset. We attempted to troubleshoot the issues ourselves and even upgraded to an additional 8GB RAM, but then contacted tech support. The first tech sent a few troubleshooting links to test the RAM, reinstall Windows 10 (which had to be downloaded to a flash drive-make sure you have one), and finally a more advanced task to disassemble the lodging for the graphics card and test it with a spare. The first tech was fairly unresponsive after we tried the first two, promised to register our account, and then we didn't hear from him for several days. We had to go to the online support via chat and found another, more savvy tech. He registered us and ended up getting an RMA for us. However, we had to spend $100 to ship and insure the CPU back to Cyber Power. We thought it was a good deal for the money, but this is a new machine and should work out of the box. If not, Cyber Power should have a local tech contract where we could have taken the CPU to be checked out for no cost. They claim they have no control over third party handling, which is why this may not be such a good deal if you have to add another C note to the total. Hopefully, we'll get a fully functional item returned to us, which they will cover, at least."
3825,3,"After 3 weeks of gaming started to experience some hard stutters when playing any of my games.CPU is at 100% almost all the time. that 1060 card is the cheapest of the lot. everything except the case and ram are super cheap.The fan they use is so easy to break, it's held together with these plastic nibs.So far i've been upgrading it and removing the turbo boost from the cpu that;s stressing the CPU.*EDIT-swapped out all parts except motherboard. It should be a 1500 dollar computer now, but the motherboard they gave me is defective. Cooling issues, trouble runnning graphics card and keeping cpu cool. New power supply, new fans new graphics card, new RAM!!!!!! very frustrating product."
3826,1,"Awful. Hard to use. Bought for 10 year old son.It’s a chromebook- therefore reason states it would work with google play. False. I set up FamilyLink and that works, but there is absolutely no way to download games or even YouTube Kids. What a headache. I do not recommend if this is the type of reason you were wanting to purchase the product."
3827,3,"At first I was very pleased with the computer, but after one month it started flickering on the screen. I contacted the seller who responded quickly. After a few informational email exchanges, I have not heard back from him about resolving the issue. I was leery about purchasing a refurbished computer and now wish I had not."
3828,1,I thought I’d get lucky because all the other reviews were pretty bad. But I didn’t. Don’t waste your time mine wouldn’t charge and would just shut down randomly because the battery wouldn’t hold a charge. Waste of money. And they make you pay for the return porstage also. And lastly. The touch pad was messed up. Sometimes it would work and sometimes it wouldn’t. Believe the reviews and don’t even bother with it.
3829,1,"Note, there are 3 components of this REVISED review. The 1st regarding the product, the 2nd regarding the vendor. And the third comprising my experiences of both after the unit failed within the warranty period, and the vendor's attempts to avoid honoring their supposed warranty.-----TL,DR: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR. With a very low effort refurb process there appears to be a higher than average number of purchased units quickly failing, and the vendor fails to honor the warranty by providing false or misleading correspondence to warranty inquiries.-----1.) I admit I wasn't expecting much as far as the Chromebook itself. I was specifically looking for a decent, stable, used/refurb older Chromebook, modestly priced unit to use for testing, debugging, and experimentation in an educational environment. It is not my primary machine, so I didn't need it to be super snappy. This model is particularity geared towards the school/student market, so I figured it would be reliably sturdy. I was pleased to find that this unit was extremely clean, well functioning, and very speedy and responsive even beyond my basic needs. The only drawback of using an older refurb unit is battery performance. This one doesn't last very long, or hold a charge well. But I'm pretty proficient with this tech, and already knew that this battery design is only optimally rated for an approximate 18 month window, after which a steady decline in battery performance should be expected. It's just part of the territory. Replacing these batteries is not very complicated. Anyone considering a refurbished model that has more than a couple of years under it should consider doing the same. This unit (true to the model line in general) has sturdy, solid feel, a responsive and snappy keyboard, a clear bright screen, and nice audio.2.) As far as the vendor, I initially could not have been more satisfied. Not only was the price lower than I expected to have to pay for a modest refurb unit, but shipping was almost immediate, and FAST! I expected a 2-day shipment via Amazon Prime, but my delivery arrived less than 23 hours after placing the order. I don't live in an area where faster than 2-day service is typically an option, so this was an especially great surprise.--------HOWEVER.......3.) After less than two months of very sparse and careful use (a combined use of under 3 hours) the unit simply died, no longer booting up.After ensuring the battery was fully charged I applied the 3-key reset method (esc-refresh-pwr) and the screen flickered the ""Chrome OS is missing...."" message before pixelating into random lines and colors, quickly seizing up. Repeated attempts produced the same results.Being proficient with this tech (I am a Chromebook administrator on a school site) it was quickly evident the unit was suffering logic board failure. Presuming that any tech support will still want to go through all the paces, I still proceeded with an attempt to freshly install Chrome OS, but it continued to freeze, flicker and pixelate upon any attempt to boot up. A call into Amazon's tech support to isolate symptoms confirmed my diagnosis of logic board failure. This is despite having very light use of this unit for less than a total of 3 hours since purchase. I was not worried as the unit has died well within the vendor's 90-day warranty, and after having been so thoroughly surprised by their very speedy purchase fulfillment, I fully expected them to honor that warranty. However the several communications I have had with this vendor have produced confusing responses with no indication thus far that they will honor the warranty and replace the unit or refund the purchase.I initially notified the vendor regarding the failure of the unit, and hoped to elicit information about their warranty coverage. I also attached the transcript of the chat with Amazon's tech support identifying logic board failure. Their response was the following:""Your message has been assigned to me, and I am reviewing it as a high priority. I will follow up with you very soon. Blazing Prices is committed to your satisfaction, and I will make every effort to resolve your concern as quickly as possible. Thanks for choosing Blazing Prices!""Have a great day!Thank you,Blazing Prizes""That is all good and well, but I took note that their response did not include an actual service representative's name to correspond with the noted ""me"" in their response. An actual contact person is usually identified in context of following a ticket through a tech support chain. This was an early indicator of a pat automated response.Two days later I received a followup email that appeared similarly automated, but with the additional note that I should contact the manufacturer for warranty assistance, stating that the manufacturer has been notified of my query and that they stand ready to assist me.Now, at this point I knew that the response was laughably suspect. Not only did they not provide any identifying contact information about whom (or how) to contact ""the manufacturer"", but I knew for a fact that this manufacturer (Dell in this case) was absolutely not poised to offer warranty assistance for a 3+ year old 2nd-hand low-end Chromebook. In short, Blazing Prices outright lied.I responded to their email about ""the manufacturer"" to see what they would say if I I asked for more information about following up with the manufacturer. I received the above-mentioned automated reply.I knew by then that I would get nowhere with the vendor. Still, I have continued to follow up with additional queries in the weeks following. As I post this I still have a few days left within the 90-day warranty period. But each response from the vendor has likewise mirrored the previously noted automated response.They are not necessarily a scammer. They sold me a product at what on the surface should have been a very competitive price. If it continued to function at least beyond the warranty period the vendor would have met their obligation decently. However it is clear by my experience, as well as those of other reviewers, that this vendor has falsified some of the claims on the product page. They certainly are not able to account for the integrity of the product - and in such cases that is what gives a supposed 90-day warranty its value - but this vendor also has shown no indication that they will honor that warranty - so having added it to the product listing constitutes fraud.I already have a tech support ticket in to Amazon regarding this purchase, and am following up with them regarding Blazing Prices fraudulence in skirting their warranty obligation.Do not purchase from this vendor."
3830,1,"Buyer beware.Computer arrived and worked while plugged in to wall charger. the Computer never took a charge.Seller doesn't offer prepaid returns for a defective DOA computer. That means he can sell you junk and you have to pay to return it. Seller did refund the purchase price, but I'm still out the return shipping."
3831,2,I received it today. The tablet was wrapped in bubble wrap and stuffed in the box. There was no instruction manual and the unit was definitely a used unit. After charging the battery I thought that I would power the device up. Nightmare begins here. I am confronted with a screen asking for a PIN. PIN??? I went online to try to factory reset the device. That made matters worse. I now have asian characters and cannot power the nightmare off. I would recommend running like hell to another manufacturer. This purchase was w waste of time and money.
3832,1,"Revise my review. Not very happy with tablet <U+2639><U+FE0F>. Only had it for 3 days had to reset 5 times. Locked out of tablet will not take pin. Love Android tablets . Speakers are good,clearty great,extra memory great. Just don't operate correctly. I think it's a return sad to say. Still not happy replacement was supposed to be new but it was a return had screen protector on it and when I go in to games someone else's screen name comes up. Headphone jack dose not work???? Try contacting tablet express still waiting for them to get back to me. Sad!!"
3833,2,"Update: piece of junk. Its now not allowing me to turn off after it refused my oin number. It wont even allow me to reset.Update: I do not like the tablet. The screen flips and I have not turned the tablet. Facebook is horrible to try and read as sometimes it only uses half the screen. Videos are almost impossible as I can only see half of it.I have several complaints about this tablet. When logging in I have to restart it to log in because it says my pin is wrong. After restarting, so far, it will take my pin. Sometimes when I try to touch things to open them they either won't open or the tablet lags. I'm not sure which one yet. Other times everything loads fast. I will have to update this when I figure it out. When I open Facebook the page is huge. I can't see the full pic or videos. I've checked settings and they are ok. Sites like Amazon and my email are normal size. I really had to look for the mini scan disc slot. You have to remove little panel and it's so fragile I was afraid I would break it. Otherwise pics are very crisp and clear.."
3834,1,"We have purchased iPads and Amazon Fires in the past (10 total) and we have had nothing but problems with this K-10. Their technical support agreed to exchange it and then later changed their mind and said it was ""user damage"". The software forced us to reset the tablet numerous times and the screen cracked from routine usage. Once the screen cracked, the touch screen became non-functional. We currently have an android from another manufacturer that was dropped and it still works. This K-10 has poor design and poor routine handling testing. I would recommend against buying it. Stick with manufacturers you know. Also, 2 faced support is very irritating."
3835,3,I have to admit that I am severely disappointed in this tablet. At first I really loved it but after only 1 Day I regretted making this purchase because the tablet might as well be a $100 paper weight because the touch screen doesn't work in the middle of the screen. I like to play games like toon blast and they require the use of the middle of the screen but this tablet is defective in the middle. If I need to scroll down I have to constantly rotate the screen and half of the time that doesn't work either. I have been trying to find a way to fix the issue for the last few weeks and there is no solution. Unfortunately I am currently not at home which is where the tablet is and by the time that I can return it It will be too late as I won't be home for the next 4 weeks so the company won't accept the return so I pretty much paid for a defective product!!!!!!
3836,3,Product was purchased for myself and i got this one bcus it came with a 1 year subscription for 360 personal Microsoft & & exactly 31 days my network adaptor was fried (you NEED this to connect to internet... So much for streaming )<U+0001F616><U+0001F629> When I sent it HP for repair as always they erase eveeything. When it was sent back Amazon blamed HP & HP blamed Amazon & no one wants to pay for my 1 year product key because when you purchase and open your computer the computer bypasses the code because its internal and you cant do a back up on a drive because the computer was inoperable once I followed prompts ordered by HP Tech Support which was to identify the problems with the laptop. Its cute. Black. Light weight.
3837,1,"These stream computers only come with 32G Hard Drives. While the computer at first runs well and is portable and cheaper than a full computer they are often out of date before you open the box and they cannot be updated. The small Hard drive is not big enough for the large bi-annual Windows updates.I called and spoke to three different people at HP Support and all three refused to help me and told me it was a windows problem. I eventually called Windows support who did help but the only way to update them is to download the full update and save it on a bootable USB drive, but again, this Stream computer does not have enough hard drive space to do that. So the only solution is to throw this away and buy another one every year to stay up to date.Spend a little more and buy a real computer and avoid all the headaches with this deceptive laptop.Shame on HP for selling this to unsuspecting customers."
3838,1,"Couldn’t even get this to run. Correction, it ran through the set up but I wasn’t able to use the Internet. I could search on google but couldn’t access any websites. Possibly because of windows 10. Not sure. Yes, I shut everything down and rebooted. All my other devices were able to connect to WiFi. HP support was AWFUL! They kept telling me nothing was wrong with the laptop. I told them couldn’t get online to turbo tax and rep at HP said “well I am able to get on the website so you should be able to get on the website.” Dumbest thing I ever heard, he’s on an entirely different computer. Needless to say, after 90 minutes on the phone with HP, they were not able to solve the issue or getting the laptop to work so I returned it. Very frustrating experience. Amazon allowed me to return with no hassle. In fact, UPS came to my door with the return label."
3839,3,"I like the size but that's all. First, it is programmed to accept only Internet Explorer for its search engine - I am used to Google Chrome and I prefer it. Second, immediately after using it and continuing up to this day, I am bombarded with scam error messages that sometimes tie up my computer. As I said, it is a scam that makes it appear that it has hijacked my computer. I never pay attention to any of it but it is extremely annoying. These two issues alone make my not like this version of the operating system."
3840,1,"Bought one of these about 14 hours ago, its slow as sin straight out of the box, has almost 0 prossessing power and if you try to bring up the task manager you end up just restarting it anyways because it locks the whole thing up. Not to mention it only comes with 4 gigs worth of internal storage(which is fine for me) in a nutshell my 7 year old smart phone runs better than this computer, it struggles to open the apps that it came with, God forbid you ever have to download any other apps. I reccomend spending the extra 200 bucks to get a laptop that can open an internet browser without crapping its guts out on your lap. I'm honestly scared to try watching a youtube video on this thing cause i dont want it to crash again and explode on my table."
3841,2,"This is my first review in over 12 years of using Amazon. I think it's ridiculous to charge $1300 or thereabouts for a laptop and have the trackpad rattle around. I read that this could be a problem for some people but just assumed it would be a very rare one. Nope, trackpad rattles each time I touch a finger to it and it annoys the hell out of me. Sending product back and will not buy again. VERY DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER.To be fair, all other features of the laptop are great and as advertised. If you can deal with throwing down a large chunk of cash on this machine and getting a faulty trackpad out of the box then go right ahead. I've done lots of research and it looks as though an alarmingly high percentage of laptops come with the trackpads that rattle. The best fix includes taking the back off and sticking a piece of paper to the back of the trackpad.Good luck."
3842,1,"I bought this computer so that I would have something which did not act wonky while traveling on business in China.What I received was a laptop that essentially cannot be used in China. Works OK in the US, with the exception of prohibiting me from accessing GOOGLE MAPS, but in China - nothing. The internet and the wi fi is totally disabled while in China. I have had someone look at the machine while in China and upon returning to the US. Neither had any idea what was the issue. I am well aware of what is and what is not censored but that was not the issue. When I asked customer service they had no suggestions other than to clear off all my programs send them the machine for 2 weeks, and hope for the best.That means being without the laptop for an extended period, not to mention the inconvenience of having to remove and then re-install every one of my programs.Why it will not allow me to use Google maps is a great mystery. Other map programs - no problem, but google maps loads for 1 second and then is blacked out. Not when I am in China mind you (that is censored) but while I'm in the US. There has been a lot written and speculated about Huawei and their motivations for entering the US market. Some have accused the company as being a trojan horse on behalf of the Peoples Party. I thought that was absurd, but after my experience - I'm not sure. There are some mighty strange things going on with this computer and frankly I am not comfortable using it and have become quite concerned about privacy issues, etc. You may want to take the risk as a user, but I would beware."
3843,1,"I have owned a lot of laptops and confess I am tough on them. This machine could have been a fantastic product, sadly it is super fragile. After owning this machine for one week - I dropped the unit about three feet, I am certain all other laptops I own would have survived with a ding I could live with, not this time. Completely shattered the screen, major damage the right corner of the keyboard. IT CERTAINLY WAS AN UNLUCKY DROP - ALL OF THE ENERGY DRIVING INTO THE RIGHT HAND CORNER of the unit - still, the amount of damage was disproportionate to the height it dropped. This product could have been a spectacular offering, and I fully admit 'the drop was my fault' - but I cannot recommend it as a good purchase."
3844,1,"I purchased this laptop a few months ago when there was a promotional deal. It came with a $300 dollar gift card at the time so I picked it up.I didn't use the laptop for a few months as I was still using my Macbook Air. Boy do I regret waiting. I thought there was something wrong with the trackpad as it would keep going crazy. Turns out it wasn't the track pad but was the touch screen. There was a hairline crack in it that I couldnt see while using it. It must've been damaged in shipping as it seems other people have had this problem...On top of that it whines, gets hot, the track pad feels cheap and loose. The final nail in the coffin is that the webcam/ microphone don't work in applications like Google Chrome or Opera. I can't video chat via Facebook or Gmail which renders the laptop basically useless for me.I have contacted Huawei about this. They want $400 to replace the screen... I asked them also about the camera/mic problem. They told me to just reset the laptop to factory settings, even though I have barely used the thing.At this point I just want to return it but I am outside of Amazon's return window. I highly regret purchasing this laptop. Don't make the same mistake."
3845,3,"One of the two devices I bought via Amazon started crashing a week after activation. I tried all possible solutions, nothing worked. There is definitely a factory defect. The worst thing is that Huawei tech support is completely failing to help me solve the situation so far.The Matebook X Pro is device with a great potential. It earned top reveiws in IT press that praises its build quality, screen and other features. Unfortunately it suffers from drawbacks that completely overweight it’s strengths. These to me are:1. Poor quality control: It is a first laptop I ever owned that malfunctioned so quickly2. Weak warranty support: I am spending hours truing to figure out with Huawei team how to fix the problem. I already reset the system twice, updated drivers, run all possible types of maintenance, nothing works. With my Surface or MacBook I would have been offered replacement or repair a while ago.I am not giving up on my Matebook yet, but the experience owning it was so far disappointing....UPDATE: it is December and Huawei is completely failing to provide any meaningful support to have it fixed. I regret the purchase."
3846,2,"UPDATE: Within 1 week my computer is no longer functional. It shut off and attempted to cycle power three times and now there is no input to my monitor keyboard or mouse.I should have read other reviews. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy from ibuypowerSpecs: Intel 8700K, Z370, Nvidia RTX 2070 8 GB, 16GB RAM, 1TB HDD, 240GB SSD, liquid cooledThe computer arrived early and was packaged very well. Booted up immediately from SSD. Honestly no issues with the functionality of the computer. The only issue that I had was that I heard a high pitched whining noise coming from inside the case, it was so loud and distracting that I could not enjoy my time in front of the computer. I discovered it to be the LED strips that are hardwired in with the case. After reading some reviews and other various posts I came to find out that this is a somewhat common issue with this case. I changed the lighting settings and the noise lessened but did not fully go away unless I turned the LEDs completely off. As I have heard horrors from Ibuypowers customer service and quality control, I was unwilling to send it back for them to replace. I'll replace the case myself if I ever decide that I want a pretty light display. Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase."
3847,2,"It's really a darn shame this computer didn't live up to its specs. I'm sure it would have been great... if it had worked. The first computer gave repeated Blue Screens of Death three days into power up. Nothing installed, just my 10 year old watching YouTube videos. Thankfully Amazon has an easy return polity.The replacement showed up two days later (before I'd even sent the original back) and the problems were worse straight out of the gate. First power up took 45 minutes. I chalked that up to Windows updates and first start time that I'd forgotten about with the first computer. Once into Windows it was incredibly laggy. I'd get the screen to go black and give me a big circular wait icon for 30m at a time: Once again I figured Windows was updating in the background. So I left the computer on overnight to let it do it's thing. In the morning: black screen complaining about can't find the Boot Medium. Hmm. I then checked the guts to make sure nothing was jostled free during shipment (it wasn't) but I did find the SSD had been installed incorrectly. I fixed that and buttoned it up. It booted right up! Except the display was now cutting in and out: black to Windows to black. So I tried an HDMI cable (instead of DP): same problem. I tried a second monitor: now it's stable. Odd. Windows still incredibly laggy... I'm suspecting SSD problems along with video card problems. I run CrystalDiskMark6 to speed test the SSD: it took 40m to finish the test and some of the numbers came back zero, so there's clearly something going on in the SSD pipeline. Shut down, eat dinner, during which the computer wakes itself up and has the Boot Medium error again. Gah!Blah blah blah: The seemingly great deal on this computer turned up bust. Twice. My kids almost had a great Christmas. Twice."
3848,1,"I wanted a fast computer and in all fairness, this seemed to fit the bill in the 3 days it was working. It loaded fast, sounded good and was great for gaming. On the other hand, even while it was working, I was really surprised that it had so few USB slots, no CD drive, no memory card slots and it couldn't handle a VGA monitor connection. It's sort of like advertising a fast car, you buy it and then it's like, ""Oh, but there are no wheels on it."" For the price, I don't feel like you should have to work around the unadvertised lack of features that come standard with pretty much every other computer. For that reason alone, it was disappointment.However, the problems with this go much deeper. Two of the USB slots weren't working. I realized that was because they weren't plugged in on this inside. Sloppy, but I fixed it. I have not been able to fix the never ending blue screen of death that started yesterday or the broken remote that came with it. I wasn't very happy with it because of the lack of standard features BEFORE it locked up and became unworkable. At this point, I am just hoping to return it and get something else. We're 45 minutes plus and waiting for their tech support, so we'll see. Needless to say, I would not recommend this computer. Buy it at your own risk."
3849,1,"I would have given this product 5 Stars but it is only deserving of 1 Star. I’ll tell you why. I have only had my Desktop for 3 days and the cheap, garbage, ADATA SSD they put in it died. I tried calling their Customer Service Number and low and behold they are closed at 5:30 pm. Now, I have a $1400 brick on my desk. Yes, I read reviews from other buyers and I should have listened and not bought this trash! It’s a good deal up front but on the inside they install garbage hardware so they can still make a profit. I should probably see what kind of trash Power Supply they installed. Their customer service number should be open 24-7! I am going to contact customer service in the morning, they better fix this! I got one last thing to say: If you are looking at this product read the reviews and don’t dismiss the negative ones as upset customers. I did and look at where it got me! I’m out $1400.00 and now I don’t have a working desktop! I had to write this review on my iPhone! Buyer Beware!"
3850,2,"0Failed right out of the box! If you are looking for a computer you know that is the worst kind of disappointment! Looking for a gaming Rig to handle anything that we could throw at it, and the power button was the stopper! After calling tech support they couldn't get it past the beginning either, just a total waste of time! I have bought many computers from many different manufacturers over the years, many of those companies are out of business now, but I have never had one not power to home screen! We decided to try to give them a second chance, and purchase another of these. The second one didn't have the liquid cooling or even the the correct graphics card, just came with a basic graphics card!!!!!! Their product control is obviously completely worthless! Going back to buying one from a reliable company!"
3851,3,"I should have consulted my tech friend before purchasing this tablet. Lenovo's own support page is littered with complaints about ""corrupted SD cards"". Per Lenovo's set up option, I elected to format the SD card for internal storage and ..... the card was corrupted upon the next reboot of the device. The card became invisible to any other device (I was trying to format it). I finally got hold of my tech buddy and he explained where using an SD card (even the fastest) for app storage is a no go (software limitation). Best not to buy a device that has modest memory / storage if you imagine that you might some day push the limit. Excuse me now - I need to pack up this misleading device for its return trip to Amazon."
3852,3,"Rare that I right such a negative review. Also know that I am not a techno-geek but have had experiences with a number of tablets. Far superior was my ASUS Zen Pad, like comparing it to the Lenova is like comparing a Mercedes to a Ford Escort. I could not get the Lenova Tab 4 to boot up to do anything with it after trying everything besides hitting it for 30 minutes. There were no ""Set Up"" prompts which you normally see to get the tablet up and running. After that I gave up, put in back in the box and shipped it back to Amazon the next day. Then immediately ordered an Amazon Fire 10, like the one I got for my wife 64GB. Another Mercedes in comparison to the Lenova. Had the Fire up and operating in 5 minutes and continued on. Maybe I got a Lenova dud but the Amazon Fire 10 at not much more cost is absolutely 5 start tablet in every way!!!"
3853,3,"I really wanted to keep this tablet. There's a lot to like about it. It's solidly built. Battery life is above average. Fingerprint scanner on the side power button works surprisingly well. Screen is high-quality and works great for e-reading, watching video content, and games.BUT--the device has a fatal flaw--it does not work reliably with micro SD cards AT ALL. I tried multiple, brand new cards, and the tablet was not able to format and use any of them reliably. Some would work the first time, but quickly get corrupted and become unusable. Others, the tablet couldn't recognize them at all from the start.When you've got a device with only 16 GB of onboard storage, roughly 10 GB of which is taken up by the OS, leaving you with 6 GB of space, this just isn't workable. Without being able to expand your storage with an SD card, you end up with no room for apps, movies, games, etc.Hopefully Lenovo can fix this at some point, but it seems from other reviews that this is a really common problem. It's a shame, because otherwise it'd be one of the few mid-range tablets on the market to truly be worth the money."
3854,1,"The preloaded stock File Manager app (called CZ File Manager by ChaoZhuo) serves ads that request your Paypal information. Take a look at the pictures I've uploaded. Loading the app takes you to the app's Home screen. See that little treasure chest in the bottom-right corner? If you click that, it takes you to the other picture I've included, which urges you to ""Spin the Wheel"" and transfer your ""winnings"" to Paypal.How a company like Lenovo could PRELOAD an app with such deceptive and possibly harmful adware is disturbing. I get that bloatware creates more revenue, but shady apps like this have NO business being preloaded on devices created by supposedly esteemed electronics manufacturers like LenovoWorse, the app CANNOT be uninstalled. You can pay $0.99 to remove the ads. Or you can disable it of course, but that doesn't change the fact that Lenovo cares so little about your safety and privacy they preloaded it in the first place, seemingly without conducting any sort of vetting on the app or the developer whatsoever.I did in fact disable it, which uninstalls all updates associated with the app and the ads mysteriously disappear! But if you update the app, the ads come back. So either Lenovo simply doesn't care about your safety and privacy online, or they got duped by the developer who added the ads via update once these tablets were sold to thousands of users. Either way, it is in really bad form to sell a device preloaded with such a garbage app that could very well be malicious."
3855,2,"First, the good: I was initially really happy with this purchase--the tablet worked great until it quit. It synced up with my Google Play account and downloaded all the Android apps that I had on my phone (at least the ones that were supported--which is most). I purchased it to use as a laptop-light. I recently switched my phone service to Google Fi, and this tablet took a Google Fi SIM card, so I could get internet anywhere, even where WiFi wasn't available. Using it over the 3G/4G network also gets around the problem of unsecured WiFi in some places. So I was initially thrilled. Then came the bad...Just over a month after I purchased this device, it started rebooting every couple minutes. Since it was past 30 days, I was unable to return it to Amazon. I sent it to warranty service with Lenovo. It has now been a month and they still claim to be waiting on parts. I have made multiple phone calls to the warranty group, and I am being told that because they don't have the parts available, they are not obligated to honor the nine-business-day warranty repair turnaround. And they are unwilling to send me a new device without ""escalating"" the ticket. I've requested the escalation, but am now told that that will take almost another week before I'm contacted regarding the escalation (at which point they may or may not agree to replace it).If a company sells a defective device, and doesn't have the parts to repair it, the device should be replaced immediately, no questions asked. To tell me there's nothing they can do because they didn't stock the parts is ridiculous. For a device that has a useful life of about two years, a month-and-a-half turnaround on the warranty service is not acceptable. I bought the device because I needed it for work. I don't expect instantaneous turnaround on the warranty repair, but I do expect that if they sell me a defective device, that they remedy the problem quickly.This would have been a 5-star review if Lenovo had come through on the warranty service. But now I would recommend finding a different brand that will honor their warranty if something goes wrong (because some number of any products will have something go wrong). I will never buy a Lenovo product again."
3856,3,"While I really liked my New Microsoft Surface Pro 2017 (i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB), Microsoft's warranty service/customer support is incredibly poor. The Surface Pro I purchased from Amazon had horrible light bleed. I waited too long to return it, so I had to do a standard replacement. I mailed it to Microsoft complete in box with all the accessories, which was a mistake as they returned the accessories to me without the box or included paperwork. The replacement Surface Pro I received was in even worse condition then the one I sent in. The metal frame was literally bent. The packaging was not damaged so it was sent out to me in that condition by the warehouse. The nice little note they packaged in with it saying they tested each replacement extensively and checked them all before sending them out was obviously untruthful. So buyer beware, the Surface Pro is an excellent device, but if anything goes wrong you will likely have trouble with the warranty exchange process and customer support. The photos included are of the replacement that was sent to me."
3857,1,"I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to offer my feedback on a new Surface Pro (2017) purchased a few months ago. I am a software engineer that has used many laptops, PCs and tech devices over the years. I can say without a doubt this is the worst peace of garbage I've ever purchased. I don't know if I have a lemon or if the issue is pervasive across all the entire line. I purchased the i7, with 16Gb RAM and 500GB hard drive. Yes, the $2K version and the freaking thing will not say on more than 10-15 minutes. It just shuts off at will. At first I thought it was overheating but it still does it at times when the unit feels relatively cool to he touch. I've tried the Microsoft Diagnostics tool for Surface Pro but it just stops right in the middle of the scan. Remember, it won't stay on for more than 10 to 15 minutes and mos repair tools take longer than that. Also tried a repair where it reinstalled Windows. It quit at the very end. I've had laptops that lasted 6+ years that didn't give me near as many problems during that time than my Surface Pro over the last 3 months. Stay away!"
3858,3,"So apparently there's a reboot loop issue with Windows 10 on the Surface... and I was lucky enough to buy a Surface that fell prey to the loop. I literally only started it once, played around with it for a day, then when I tried to turn it on the second day... endless reboot loop. Resetting it and even trying to reboot from USB wasn't working so I sent it in to Microsoft for a replacement since it's under warranty, but I'm still not happy with the experience of buying a $1,200 Surface that became useless within less than 24 hours of having it. Definitely doesn't inspire confidence in my future use of the device once I get it back in like a month. I'll update this when I get it back and give a proper review of my use of the device. In the meantime, I'll have to borrow a laptop for school."
3859,1,"$2400 for a ""1TB SSD"" that's not really a 1TB SSD - BUYER BEWARE.Microsoft is cutting corners on these devices by installing 2x 512GB SSDs and running them in proprietary RAID 0. The Windows OS does not recognize the SSDs AS SSDs and views the RAID 0 array as a HARD DRIVE; rendering TRIM inoperable and useless. If just ONE of these two drives has the slightest issue, your Surface becomes an expensive paperweight and your data vanishes into thin air.HIGHLY recommend running cloud based backup software with these devices if you're saving information locally that's critical to you. Unbelievably underhanded and dishonest practice by Microsoft; will be scrutinizing all MS device purchase with extreme caution as a result, moving forward."
3860,2,"February 14, 2018: I so REGRET having spent the money on the 2017 release of the Microsoft Surface Pro Model 1796. I started having problems with system errors, random shutdowns or reboots, or failures that prompted a system restore (i.e. the blue restore or reset screens) within the first two months in late July to late September 2017. Within 3 months by late October 2017, the tablet was completely unrecoverable without taking it into a Microsoft Service Center. At the time, I was overseas for an extended business trip. I had to wait two more months until December 31, 2017 to take this into a Microsoft Service Center. The Service Center reinstalled Windows 10 and added the latest updates and patches. This seemed to resolve the matter. But within three weeks in late January 2018, I was again experiencing random shutdowns or reboots. Just this past weekend around 10 February, my Surface Pro hard crashed. This time I don't even get the blue restore or reset screens with the different reset options. This time I get a different screen with a “reset” option that sends me into the unending loop of the two pictures that I’ve attached. Again, I’m overseas and now I have to see if I can ship this worthless tablet to Microsoft and hopefully this time they will replace it. If not, I will never again purchase of piece of Microsoft hardware."
3861,2,"Bought this back in September and have been patient with trying to use it but honestly it's been utter garbage since I took it out of the box - for a machine that advertises it loads games in seconds it can barely run a game that was running mostly fine on an old Lenovo that wasn't even a gaming PC that I bought back in 2015. The last straw happened recently when I put it to sleep and it just wouldn't wake up - or rather it would try, and then spend the next several hours in a repair/analyzing mode that didn't actually do anything. After numerous attempts at factory resets (which ALSO failed, how a machine fails to do a factory reset is beyond me) I've given up and figured I'd try sending this either to Amazon to fix or possibly MSi to see if I can get something out of it - honestly this experience has turned me off this brand for good."
3862,3,"Do not purchase this laptop. I bought it specifically to be used as a general use PC/play mild video games while on vacation and away from my custom built desktop.After 10 hours of ""use,"" it no longer boots to Windows 10 or safe mode or any other variation thereof. I had previouslu bought an MSI MOBO which refused to boot unless windows 10 was the OS, but I had worked around all of those problems. I should have known better: MSI has boot issues, no way around it. Compliance with windows 10 does not fix these issues... It simply refuses to boot.At this point, this MSI built Laptop has decided to do absolutely nothing besides turn on and have red lights illuminated under the keyboard... Yet it fails to boot. Repeatedly. After being on the phone with technical support and windows support for a combined 10 hours, I am told that the hardware is defective and must be replaced.Excuse me, no thank you. I will take a full refund and purchase hardware and equipment that actually works as intended instead of this wishy-washy hogwash.Run like heck from this machine. It is not of ANY quality. It WILL break, even if it works at first. MSI can and should do better, but I will never buy another product of theirs.Their mishandling of this $800 machine has cost them at least $20,000 of future revenue, as I simply REFUSE to buy their products at this point... And I buy a lot of PC parts. If you have any knowledge/standards, of PC components, steer clear."
3863,3,"I am extremely disappointed with this laptop. This is a replacement that I ordered after the first one had the same issue. I figured I just got a defective unit the first time since my previous MSI worked without any issues. But nope. The second laptop is doing the same thing and unfortunately I am outside of the Amazon return window.The laptop crashes and says Repairing Disks then either dumps to the BIOS screen or just never repairs. Every month I've had to wipe it and reset to default settings. Only for it to crash and have to do it all over again.After doing more research, this is a common issue with MSI. Apparently it is not unusual for MSI to use parts that are not compatible. I'm going to contact MSI and see if they can resolve it. Otherwise, I just bought myself an $800 brick."
3864,2,"The first unit I received shortly died after a few hours of usage. The power surge/ac adaptor blew up the capacitor and possibly fried my laptop. CPU and RAM were running low. GPU wasn't drawing a lot of power because I was playing World of Warcraft on the recommended settings. Either I just had bad luck or I was thinking maybe that I drew too much power from all the usb ports to power and connect my Logitech G13, Laptop Cooling Pad, and Logitech PowerPlay Pad with G903 Mouse.Got my replacement recently and I haven't had any major issues so far. I did have to plug my laptop into its AC Adapter to turn it on the first time which was weird because the battery was already at full charge. I'm still worried about the quality of capacitor and conductor inside this thing. I just hope it doesn't go pop and start burning again.Overall, it is a great laptop for the price. I would recommend updating the RAM from 8gb to at least 16gb. The CPU runs super fast and doesn't start utilizing its full potential until you start doing things like installation of applications, but the Memory Usage sits around 40-50% the most of the time. I can notice some slow downs when opening Windows Explorer any some of my apps when I have other programs up.I like the addition of the cooler boost button, but most of the time I don't have to use it because I have a ThermalTake Auto Laptop Cooling Pad that monitors the bottom surface of my laptop. If I don't have my ThermalTake fan on the laptop can get as hot as 93-97 degrees Fahrenheit while sitting idle or playing games. My fan can get it as low as 82-83 degrees, consistently, while idle or gaming. Booting it up from a restart or shutdown is about as fast as an SSD.Trackpad is OK. The SteelSteries Keyboard feels great and looks awesome, but the keyboard surface of the laptop can get warm while sitting idle or gaming even when I have a fan pushing cold air underneath the laptop. There are air intakes/air vents that take in air on the bottom of the laptop. So I suggest getting a mesh aluminum or metal stand/cooling pad with your purchase.The monitor is bright and colorful. I don't see any problems with it. 1920x1080 is fine when gaming.Wireless card is finicky with both units I had. My laptop seems to lose its internet connection at random times. It is a bit frustrating.Some bloatware, but not as bad as it was 10 years ago;. Most of the bloatware seems to be from Microsoft itself after the laptop installs the updates. Uninstall Minecraft, Candy Crush, the preloaded Microsoft games, and the two Norton Internet Security applications then you're fine. Keeping the MSI software is optional, a few of these are useful like BurnRecovery to make a backup of your version of Windows just in case anything happens.I'll update and give more stars after I've had this laptop for a month without any issues.Update(09/02/2018): After using this laptop for for almost a week now the headphone 3.5mm jack is now only outputting audio to the left side of my headphones only. I checked the balance settings for both sides on the windows volume mixer menu and they’re both set to default. I used three different headphones and I still had the same issue. I updated the RealTek Audio drivers and tested it using Razer Surround’s audio drivers; It still did not fix it. So now this leads me to believe it is a hardware issue.I’m taking one star off because every it is very frustrating to spend my time to install and update everything on this laptop to only have a hardware component fail shortly after. I’m returning this and purchasing something else from a different manufacturer."
3865,1,"When you receive this computer, there is a note from MSI explaining that if you review this item as 5-stars on Amazon, they will send a free pair of $100 headphones. At this point, I felt like I had been tricked. The computer's hardware is decent, but the materials are poor. I had a Dell XPS 15, and it was nowhere close to that level in terms of build and materials.The screen is surprisingly poor. I constantly had to adjust the angle because it is constantly ""washed out."" It is a difference of only a few degrees, and even changing seating position would wash out the screen.But the biggest issue, and why I am only able to give it one star, is that is crashed twice on me within weeks of getting the computer. I did research online and this seems to be a very common issue with these computers, and with MSI laptops in general. Twice all of my files were removed. It took hours to restore to factory default settings, and it crashed once again days later. This is completely unacceptable for any computer to have this recurring issue, let alone a mid-tier performance gaming laptop."
3866,2,"The first thing I noticed after opening the box was that my computer was not wrapped in bubble wrap. Only a little bit of paper. I could feel it shifting as I carried it into my home. When I got it open, Immediately saw the dirty looking condition. I had to get a damp cloth to wipe off the outside due to the fact my hands got dirty just taking it out of the box. Afterward, I could see what appeared to be clear nail polish or glue around and on the mousepad. I managed to get it off with a tile cleaner. Although it seems to be working fairly well, I cannot express my distaste in the condition it was delivered. That is why I am SUSPENDING my Amazon Prime. A review of the company that supplied this needs to be done!"
3867,1,"I just bought this computer for my daughter for her birthday. The computer arrived and I never opened the package and wrapped it the night before her birthday. I work first shift so she was allowed to open one present when she woke up. I got home from school so she could open all her presents. The look on her face when she opened the computer was priceless the joy on her face was just amazing. My daughter is a cheerleader and had to cheer on her birthday, with that being said I stayed home an showered since I just got home from work. She did power the computer up before she left so I got on YouTube and instantly noticed a line across the screen so I emailed Amazon. I received a message stating a refund so I was going to take a picture of the screen to show them what I was talking about and went to the computer and it wouldn't even turn on. This is a piece of junk do not I repeat do not by this product."
3868,1,"It's small, slim, and compact. Overall the design and feel are nice. But I was unaware of what a chrome book actually is and for me it was totally pointless to own another tech device the u pretty much use as a internet browser.If you are looking for a cheap pc don't buy a chromebook. Because why? It's a chromebook that why, unless your life revolve around Google and their apps then don't get a chromebook. You can't download any type of software on it not Microsoft word, iTunes, a lot of the basic things that's we use on a pc you cannot get on a chromebook.I am a only student and I can barely do my school work on this thing. Microsoft is an online app really? Couldn't install an extension so that I could take an exam for one of my classes, so I had to go to the library and use a regular pc.My opinion either get a pc or a MacBook. A chromebook made me feel like I was moving backwards in the tech world instead of forward!"
3869,2,"I really liked my Chromebook, but all I received with my package was the notebook and nothing else! No user manual or anything to help me understand how to use it! I'm a senior and I'm quite ignorant to navigating my way around in a computer so I was looking forward to learning.. Not only that but the 2nd time I went to use it, the screen part which surrounded the screen fell off.. It liked as tho somebody glued it on and it just fell off so now I have a defective device and no understanding of how to use it!! Very dissatisfied, but I would like to have a replacement sent with instructions PLEASE!"
3870,1,"who has these computers that they get so busted? i'm lucky, mine was just scuffed and dented (i've seen others with much worse,) but it still wasn't good enough to keep. i didn't even bother to turn it on, i just returned it. definitely won't be buying 'refurbished' products in the future, and i doubt you should either. spend the extra 20-40 bucks and just get a brand new one, don't bother. you're already spending almost 200 bucks for a new device. 3 stars because it was decent for a used item & the price but certainly not something i'd recommend or go near again."
3871,3,"We bought this as a birthday present for my 5 year old. We have had problems with it since day 1. We have had this since September 2015 (I am reviewing this in January 2016) because I am absolutely fed up with the constant annoyances from this tablet. Instead of writing a lengthy summary, I decided to list pros and cons, and explain in detail the more important ones.Pros-- The preloaded games are really great (when they work). My 5 year old loves them, and there are plenty of options for him so he never gets bored.- There are also quite a bit of educational games that are a nice feature. He enjoys the math game the most because it has the ""fun"" of a regular game but also the challenge of math equations.- The ""pen"" that comes with the tablet is a nice feature, especially for the drawing app.- The case that comes with it is not only very sturdy but also the rubberized edging seems to help with gripping. He never has to worry about his hands getting to sweaty and accidentally dropping it.Cons:- The battery life is HORRIBLE. We charge it every night. He plays with it in the morning car ride on the way to school which is about a 10 minute drive. If he does not turn it off completely, it will be dead by the time I pick him back up at 2:30. When he does remember to turn it off, he will then play after homework, for about 30 minutes and without fail. every night the battery is almost completely dead. It never lasts more than 24 hours, and considering I only let him play MAYBE an hour a day, in separate time increments, that is absolutely ridiculous. I was really thinking this would be great for road trips, but we have made the drive to Atlanta which is about a 2 hour drive, and it is dead before we get there.- The pre-loaded movies have yet to actually load. As soon as we set everything up. we tried to watch How to Train Your Dragon (which is one of the three pre-loaded movies) and never could get it to load. It would just stay black, no matter how long we left it. I posted on the Nabi facebook page because I read reviews that the customer service was best through there facebook page. They responded almost immediately with tips on resetting the tablet and other ways to get the movies to preload. We tried everything they suggested over the next several days and nothing worked. We have finally given up on them ever working which is a huge disappointment because they were one of the reasons we initially decided on this tablet.- The passwords for wi-fi and the parental mode are constantly not working. If ever I need to adjust anything in the mommy mode setting, the password I use only works maybe 50% of the time. The other times it will try to load for a few minutes and then finally tell me the password is incorrect. I have used the same password for this tablet since the day we set it up and I will try multiple times to make sure I am not accidentally messing anything up. A few days later I try again, and suddenly the password works again. Same thing for Wi-Fi in certain places. If he ever comes to my work with me, I have to put the wi-fi password in each and every time and several times it will say the password is incorrect even though it is the same one we have had for years. It is almost as if it is just unable to connect internally, so it just gives up and says the password is wrong.-Overall there is nothing this tablet advertises that others dont also have. I really wish we had gone with a different tablet because this one is becoming nothing short of frustrating. I guess we know what he is getting for his 6th birthday..."
3872,3,"The tablet was really wonderful while it worked. I was able to set up a profile for each of my children, that way I didn't have to buy a tablet for each of them. It tracks their usage and allows me to limit time on the device and/or specific apps. Unfortunately, after using it for only a couple of months it stopped working. It would just freeze on the boot up screen. I followed to instructions to hard rest the device, wiping out all the settings, profiles and additional apps I had installed myself. We were able to use it after that for a couple more month and then the same thing happened. I did not try to contact support because the one time I called in about a billing question it was very frustrating and not helpful."
3873,2,"This is single worst electronic purchase I've ever made. If you love the person this tablet is intended for, show them you love them by NOT ordering this tablet.We originally ordered one tablet in the middle of last year and it failed after a month. The tablet would not boot into the operating system. Nabi was able to exchange the product at that time for us and sent us another one.We purchased another set of 2 (since we have 3 kids) right before we moved houses. We packed the tablets away for about 4 months and once we unpacked them we realized 2 of them no longer boot. We now have 2 broken tablets out of 3 but when you look at the odds, all 3 tablets were broken. I contacted Nabi support and they kept saying ""we see this a lot, let's fix this by going into the boot screen"".The bootscreen options weren't selectable on either tablet since the preoloader was locking up. It was so bad they admitted that the secret boot menu issue could take ""7 or more tries"" for it to actually work. They are both completely useless. Nabi said we could send them back in but insisted that we pay the shipping and warned us (if there's ANY damage caused by shipping we're blaming you).This is such an awful product. You shouldn't have to pay to return an item that's defective. You shouldn't have a product that fails 3 out of 3 times. I would not trust this or any other merchandise from this company.Outside of these being broken - the original charge and bootup process took quite a few hours for all of the updates to finish. The tablet itself is extremely slow."
3874,2,"**IT ONLY GOT A STAR BECAUSE I HAD TO PUT ONE IN ORDER TO SUBMIT!!!**I ordered this as a birthday present for my daughter. She is 4, ad I didn't think that she was old enough to handle a regular tablet, and felt that a child one was more suitable. The set up was easy. But that was the only thing!!! After setting it up, she plugged in her headphones and played with the tablet all of 3 days. After that she couldn't hear anything. I thought it was the headphones, so we took them out, still couldn't hear anything. Then I goggled the problem and saw that other parents has had the same issue with his tablet. So I finally got it to play without the headphones after resetting the tablet back to factor and setting it up again. Once the setup was complete for the SECOND time, she wasn't able to use any apps that weren't originally apart of the tablet. THAT PART SUCKED!!!! That was the main reason why I bought the tablet, because she could use pre loaded and apps from the Google Play Store at the same time. That was the finally straw and I boxed everything back up to ship back. While printing out the return label I found out that I was only going to get back part of my money because they charged a 15% return fee, and that I had to pay to ship it back to LA. That cost me $23.00 to send back. And I know to some that is not a lot of money, but to me a single parent, that was a unnecessary cost for something that I am returning because it didn't work. I have learned my lesson, will NEVER purchase a Nabi again, and will NEVER purchase from this seller!!!!"
3875,1,"I don't know why we continued to buy Nabi tablets after they burned us with the first one, but I regret it. This one was a great deal, and had everything we needed in a tablet, too bad it only worked for a few months. Nabi is no help at all when it comes to customer service.Every tablet we've gotten from them has last a few months then just given up and based on reviews I'm not the only one who has had these issues.This particular one gets stuck on the loading screen forever and wont boot up the table fully. We've asked for help, they told us to factory reset it, or hard reset it, but the menu they describe and steps cannot be done while it is stuck in this current state. Since it is ""out of warranty"" they really don't care one way or another.I wouldn't recommend this, even when it worked it would often run slow, or apps would quit randomly. It's not worth the hassle."
3876,1,"My Galaxy Note 2014 was dying and I didn't want to spend a lot. I wasn't expecting a lot. My initial impression was this was a good bang for the buck. I can't verify the RAM but it does seem to indicate it is 64 GB as advertised. Sound is weak compared to my previous table, but not by much. Screen is not great but okay. My problem came when I tried to install Kodi and I could not install. It said it was not compatible. That seemed odd as I had it on my other tablet. A little research showed me why. In the settings about version it lists Android 5.0. Tap it a few times and the animation comes up with a K for Kitkat. That is version 4.4.Not only does this possibly present security issues, though it looks like they are recent builds so maybe they are patched, it presents a problem running new software. Android 4.4 was released October of 2013, 4 going on 5 years ago. This is fraud! I[m going to be returning mine. I'm very disappointed Amazon would would sell this.If you just want to browse the web, watch a video and don't plan on shopping or using any modern apps or features go for it. If you want to by from an honest company skip these liars.UPDATE: I got a refurbished Acer Iconia with 2 GB RAM and a 1024x600 screen. It has a 1.3 GHz processor compared to the listed 4 GB RAM and 2.5 GHz processor that the Yellyouch supposedly has. Under a magnifying glass pixelation was simlar but the Acer screen was day and night better. THe Acer also saw my 5G wifi which the Yellyouth did not. The Acer was smoother and faster but after opening just 4-5 apps the Yellyouth lagged and the Acer was smooth as butter and way faster. It would also load Kodi. The Acer actually has Adnroid 7 it easily reads my 128 GB micor SD which the Yellyouth would not even read in USB to go mode and I paid less for it!My final assessment is that most likely the Yellyouth tablet doesn't handle newer faster wifi for the same reason the screen is so horrible, it is so slow and lags so much. Why would a manufacturer put a 4 year old OS on new hardware? Duh? They woudn't. I believe this tablet is either several years old or maunfactured from old parts. I suspect it has unpatched security issues though I can't be sure but given the amount of fraud here I see no reason to trust them. Avoid at all costs!"
3877,3,"Not happy with this product at all. I ordered it just to have something in my car for my son to watch. The first thing I did was connect it to my WiFi, next I accessed YouTube and wanted to download some Baby Einstein videos. As I was attempting to log into my YouTube account, none of the letter buttons were working. I would push one letter both with my finger and the stylus probably 60 times and the letter might have registered once if at all. I am never one to complain and I have never left anybody a bad review, but for $100 the keys at least should have worked! Sending this tablet back ASAP!"
3878,3,"Considering the specs that it 'claims' to have, you would assume it would run better. However, as noted elsewhere, there is no way this has a legitimate 4 gbs of RAM and a true 'octo-core' processor! A tablet with those kinds of specs should run remarkably fast, but this runs like a car with one cylinder working. The screen isn't glass, but some kind of totally cheap, easily scratched plastic. It's worthless for writing on as it's lack of responsiveness prohibits such due to the terrible capacitive abilities of the screen and memory+processing ability. Yes, it's cheap, but they shouldn't be allowed to sell on this site at all, for any price. After reading some of the other remarks, they are apparently misleading as far as the specs go too which is misleading and should be downright illegal. BTW, the power practically drains as soon as you take it off the charger as well."
3879,1,"Whatever you do do not buy this product! This product is a piece of trash and the reason for this is because the Chinese manufacturer that builds this product has hacked the firmware in other words operating system on the phone and they make it look like it has more processing power/memory when in reality it actually only has 2 GB of RAM – 16 GB of storage and a very slow arm processor.This is one of the largest scams going on right now on Amazon and also on the Chinese market, so I highly recommend not buying this product because it is just a piece of trash the tablet crashes all the time because the operating system is so old and the operating system is actually android for which is android Kit Kat which is a very old version of android.I contacted the company that makes these tablets and they would never tell me anything on the actual hardware components of this tablet therefore I had to actually pull it apart and look at the components myself because the tablet died on me and is no longer working so I highly recommend not buying this tablet because it is not stable and the battery overheated all the time.Hope this helps someone avoid this scam."
3880,3,"I bought this tablet after another reviewer said he was able to cast to Youtube and a Firestick . Unfortunately, this does not work for me.When I use the Google Home app to cast, I get the message ""screen casting not optimized for this device"".If I cast to one of my Chromecast audio devices, the audio is about 10 seconds behind and stutters horribly.If I cast to a Chromecast ultra (video), I get no video, only audio, and it is also about 10 seconds behind and stutters horribly.Unfortunately, I have to send this tablet back because I bought it specifically for casting."
3881,1,"Disappointing. All so cloud-based that software, like Excel (which has to be leased separately) randomly closes while you are working. Then sometimes can be re-opened normally but sometimes it takes a long time or never opens. Or tells you only a COPY can be saved because ""someone else"" has it open. And a few times a week when you attempt to open your most recent version you get an insulting message that apologizes and offers no options. Your work is gone. Poof.No easy opportunity to build files and store them on the computer but they are squirreled away in the cloud and you are left wondering if ever you will see them again.Update: ONE day after my return window closed I found out that this CANNOT download drivers so you cannot scan directly to it. The suggest scanning to another device then sending it to this one!"
3882,1,Purchased this model from B&H Photo and I have to say I really do not like it. Normally I have enjoyed all my Chromebooks but this model IMHO is way overpriced for what you get. You can buy models 1/3 this cost and be just as happy if not happier with your purchase. I have a Samsung model that works as well and seems higher quality. I also had the unit quit 2 months after purchasing it and it was like pulling teeth to get help from Google. B&H only covered it for 30 days. Google was supposed to cover it for 1 year. Google IMHO has the worst support staff I have ever dealt with. They wanted to do everything by email after my initial call and it would be 4 or 5 days between emails going back and forth trying to get them to replace a dead computer. I would stay as far away from this computer as you can. Just my advice from my experience.
3883,3,"therer are some really nice things about this computer. it is fast and easy to use and it is simple. but it is also really limited in what it can do. also there is very limited support. the glass on the back of the top broke. i didnt drop it or hit it. i actually have no idea how it broke. things break, thats just life right, but there is absolutely no way to get it fixed. google just wont sell parts. i guess they are trying to be like apple? its amazing to me there is no way to fix this. it doesnt affect the functionality of the computer it is true but it affects the aesthetic and the aesthetic is a part of what i like about pixelbook and is why google hired Alberto Villareal to design the pixelbook."
3884,3,"I wanted to love this product. Simplicity of chrome OS, beautiful screen, nice design in a compact package. There were drawbacks and I knew that going into it. Everything was ok for the first two months, I had no regrets, it was what it was. BUT, something started just recently that I can't accept. The speaker just randomly started getting distorted and crackling at normal volume. The pixelbook is already not known for it's speaker and audio playback, and I knew that, and I could live with that. What I can't live with is this distortion and crackling, making it impossible to listen or play anything. If you search the web, there's a long thread in the user forums for the pixelbook going back to the beginning, and there's NO solution. So disappointed."
3885,1,"DO NOT BUY!!!This is the WORST product I've ever received. My husband gave me one of these for Christmas and I used it twice before the screen malfunctioned. When we called Google to ask to return the item we were told it was outside of the 14 day return policy since my husband purchased it back in the end of November ( it was only a week after Christmas though when we called). We were told our only option was to get a replacement for it. They would not send another new one, only a refurbished one. We just received the refurbished computer and it doesnt work either. We charged it and tried to turn it on, and it is making very lound noises and just shuts down when we try to sign in. When we called again to ask if we can now return the product they still redused. We now have to wait another week or two to get another refurbished one. It is now February and I still have not been able to use this Christmas gift. These ate way too expensive for such poor quality. I would NEVER recommend this to anyone."
3886,3,"I have found so many faults in my tablet that i am having to return it. I wish i had just bought this from a trusted seller instead of falling for the ""2017 newest"" which is THE EXACT SAME MODEL. But...it actually isnt the same. My tablet arrived on time and in the box. Sticker says Walmart. Opening package and it was just a tablet and keyboard in a black slip. Screen is cloudy looking and has a few marks on it. AC adapter is not the right power either. Its a pin ac adapter for 1000ma and reading more into this i need a 2000ma. Which explains why it will not charge more than 12%! looking more into this tablet i am noticing a lot of strange things. Storage is 24gb not 32. Also...is there a reason why in my internal storage i have folders from 2014. That are empty. There is 3 manual apps downloaded on mine. In 3 different languages! Also walmart apps that will not go away. Pretty disappointed..."
3887,1,"let me start by saying my wife and I are in the military and our primary means of communication is through video chat. Video chat has been my only way to see my wife, kids and pets on a daily basis. Not to mention when you can connect the quality is lower than it was in 2005. I purchased this as a cheaper version to do so. If you want this as a way to video chat or really do any form of communication in real time DO NOT buy this. We have tried facebook messenger and skype and pretty much every other common communication app/website you can think of. We have tried the app version and website version of everything. The bad news does not stop there every app i have installed(facebook, spotify, amazon) will either run incredibly slowly or stop running entirely. The only thing I have been able to use without much hit to speed or quality is youtube. The touch screen portion of this is pathetic if you remove the keyboard you have a gigantic nonresponsive screen and if you leave the keyboard on you have a slightly more responsive screen with a very dry scratchy surface. Every smart phone we have used in the last 5 years was WAY more effective. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET AN ACTUAL LAPTOP!!"
3888,3,Nice inexpensive tablet however it has an USB connection to connect tablet to computer for transfer of files. I attempted to transfer files and it was not happening. I contacted their support and was informed that the tablet required a proprietary cable that I had to purchase from them. This information was not supplied on their page at Amazon and also did not appear in their manual in the section dealing with connecting tablet to computer. Not sure if this omission was purposefully or inadvertently done.Initially gave this a 3 star for the above issue however I have edited my review to a 1 star after finding that the USB cable needed for the process of transferring data between my computer and tablet which today is a basic use for tablets / computers cost $23.00. This increased the cost of the product to a questionable buy for me. The vendor needs to be more transparent in the description of the hidden cost of the merchandise.
3889,1,"I had one of these in a different color and it worked fine but it got broken by accident so I got this one. It has never worked the way it should, won't open, freezes all the time, just not connecting the way it should and after it froze or kept shutting off over the last 24 hours I finally broke down and called Amazon. They referred me to the warranty company I purchased the extended 1 year warranty from. The warranty people told me to contact RCA since there was a 1 year manufacturer's warranty on it. (So why did I pay extra for an extended one?!?!) RCA said I had to go to the web site and put in a claim, yada, yada, yada. So 3 phone calls and an hour later all I heard were a lot of people saying how sorry they are and I'm left wondering why I spent money on a useless warranty and an even more useless tablet. Not happy. I do not recommend this item."
3890,3,"Bottom line up front: Fresh out of the box, the tablet was unable to perform the most basic of tasks such as opening PDFs, PNGs, and word documents. It even failed to update apps from the play store or install them properly.Full review: I was in the market for an inexpensive 2n1 to use for school when I was away from home. I only needed something basic with a keyboard and this seemed to fit my needs. The problem is that it failed to meet those bare minimal requirements. The first problem I had was that it was a struggle to update apps from the Google Play store. It took several restarts and dozens of failed attempts before I was finally able to update Chrome (it was a 31mb update) along with most of the other apps. Some apps continued to fail to install their updates (such as Android System Webview) so I just moved on.It completely failed to open messenger. The app would open and as the login screen came up, a prompt telling me that the app has failed and needed to close prevented me from using it even though the cursor was flashing in the app behind it. So I installed messenger lite and moved on.It did manage to sync my google accounts pretty easily but that was the first, last, and only thing it did successfully. Attempting to open PDFs prompted me with the message ""The document cannot be opened because it's not a valid pdf-document"" no other device has had any issue opening the same file. At this point I'm wondering if anything worked so I just try to open different file types:docx: crashedpng: barely and it struggled with zooming in and scrolling aroundI took a glance at the memory usage to figure out why it struggled with everything. The Android OS alone used 67% of the tablet's processing power. By this point I just accepted it as a loss, closed it and went about my day.I didn't have a lot of demands for this product being that it was only $120 but opening word docs, PDFs, and images is a pretty low standard to meet. The fact that this product couldn't even do that or even update apps properly is nothing short of embarrassing."
3891,2,"I love this laptop, the performance is very good, but it is too HOT, I can not place it on my legs, when I use the keyboard I feel the heat. It's hot even when it does basic tasks like surfing the internet. When I use it for work (editing or design with adobe) the battery lasts 4 hours.It gets very hot, on the edges of the keyboard and below it.When you charge, your charger gets hotter, I can not even touch it, I have to wait for it to cool for a few hours.Configure the performance in the synapse app but it does not help at all to solve the heat problem, you can improve the fan revolutions but the noise is too much."
3892,3,"I love the labtop, great for gaming and work. BUT, since owning, the camera and microphone has stopped working. There is a known defect that shouldn't be an issue. Also the USB ports are fragile and can break!Other than that, its a great labtop, i had to use my headset/cellphone for a video call workaround. But, I am concerned that the quality of this labtop is still not at the same level as Macbooks. And I don't want to get back into that ecosystem."
3893,3,"Wtf!! So i just received my laptop. And it didnt come with an the SSD drive. Yeah it has the 1 tb. But where the hell did the other storage go ?4/26/2019 so after 2 days of having the laptop, i noticed the laptop would overheat for normal use like being on the internet and using Netflix. I dont knownid this is also part of the cause that my computer kept turning itself off. The screen would go black then moment later so would the keyboard. I decided to return it the day of writing this review. Dont get me wrong rhe build quality is nice with also thin bezels. But after having the laptop and going through what i went through not worth it. At least i was able to contact amazon supprt and they were super supportive with the missing SSD and also for the return process, so big shout out to them."
3894,1,"GARBAGE SUPPORT FROM RAZER, BASICALLY TOLD ME TO DEAL WITH IT AND REFUSED TO GIVE ME MY GAME CODE.AMAZON SUPPORT IS GARBAGE, NO REPLIES TO MULTIPLE EMAILS.Edit: I purchased this on Amazon US, not sure why it is not showing as a ""Verified Puchase""Bought this beast after researching for a long time. Runs without a hitch right out of the box. The laptop is well built and feels very premium to the touch. Screen is robust and vibrant, very true to its 100% sRGB claim. Temperatures are good, not too warm under high loads. Fans are surprisingly silent. Haven't found a single thing I dislike about this laptop despite trying to nitpick the smallest of flaws. Great buy! The only disappointment is that I did not get the CoD BO4 redemption code as advertised."
3895,3,"I know. It's a gaming laptop. Who cares about the keyboard? I'll tell you who. People who work for a living and can afford to pay this much for a laptop. The build quality is incredible. It is a beautiful thing to look at and touch. The screen is great. The fans are a little loud but it is a thin and light gaming laptop so you'd be daft to not expect that. But man, is the keyboard terrible. I mean, I have a cheap bluetooth keyboard I use for my Android tablet that is better than this. And it's not just the lack of key travel and feel. The layout is terrible too. I type A LOT and for all the wonderful things that this this system does the keyboard was just unacceptable. I used it for a couple hours and it was back in the box with a return label. In case you are interested, I bought a Dell XPS 15 9570 instead and yes, it's not a gaming system per se, but it is 90% of the power of this machine while managing to be usable for productivity tasks."
3896,1,"I am extremely disappointed with what I received in the mail. I was expecting the washi tape rolls in the picture they provided, but instead I received something totally different. And most of the patterns are the same. The rolls also look even thinner than in the pictures they provided. <U+2639><U+FE0F> Still going to use- because I don’t think it’s worth the hassle to return for $6. But I wouldn’t reccomend this product."
3897,3,The seller states these are only 2mm wide I may have missed that - these are just too small for me to handle - and I have small hands - just an FYI. This is my first time using washi tape so I'm not sure how they're suppose to stick. I put some on a card I made for Mother's day and it does seem to peel pull off somewhat easily. Other than that you do get a good assortment of pretty designs and colors.
3898,1,"This is ridiculous! Usually, I'm pretty chill about stuff like this, because, c'mon mistakes are bound to happen, don't need to get my panties in a twist over some whoops washi tape, right? And, really, it's not *that* big of a deal, and I'd probably toss it in a drawer and forget about it and just order some other washi from a different seller, and forget all about it, but on a hunch I thought I'd check the reviews again, because this HAD to be a one off fudge up, right? Well, low and behold, it's NOT a one off, and it's happened to at least a fever other buyers very recently, so this certainly doesn't qualify for an ""opps"" quality control slip... I get that there these ""oops"" orders happen from time to time, but this many so recently is just crap/lazy business... Buyer be warned, I guess..."
3899,3,"This is my first investment ever in buying washi tape. I've always wanted to start a journal, so I finally caved and picked the set with designs I liked most. I wasn't disappointed at all. Just a little confused, because they seemed a little thinner than all the examples I've seen, so I wasn't sure if I was doing it right or if this was how it was supposed to look. But that's my fault for not paying attention. They still work great! I don't regret the purchase at all, and I have a lot of fun with it, so I might even buy some more real soon. I was also using a pretty big composition book, like 9.75x7.5, so they probably would look better with something smaller."
3900,1,"So disappointed in this product. I bought them for an easy mess free way to decorate our Easter eggs. More than 2/3 of the tape were all the same pattern, this white tape with green patches on it. Some of them were even plain white. Ended up throwing them away because they were vibrant or fun at all. Thankfully I ordered Washi tape from a different brand at the same time just in case. DO NOT BUY THESE, I DONT CARE HOW CHEAP THEY ARE."
3901,2,"I was so excited to receive these and immediately did a swatch sheet to see how the colors appeared. I received multiples of a couple tones and a couple tones are missing. Also, the product photo shows there is a watercolor blender brush, and the description says it comes with one, but mine didn't. I bought these because of the convenience of a watercolor affect without having to set up for painting.. so to not have the blender paint brush defeats the purpose of having these. They aren't worth purchasing the blender separately and it isn't worth the hassle of bringing out a paint brush and glass of water because at that point I'd rather use my watercolor paints, especially since these colors are flat. Horrible purchase. Will return and will never purchase Arteza products again."
3902,3,all but two of my 48 pack are dried out. the thought was nice but the quality is awful. I guess I didnt read enough reviews. this was one set I was super excited to get and I took out one of my 20.00 water color papers and had the design ready to start and got nothing but the water on my paper. . they look great in the but one swipe and all i have is a clear brush and no color. best to go back to the old fashion way. arteza dont give up. just improve the quality as this is a real fail.
3903,3,"I hate to say this bc I’ve been looking forward to these for a really long time, but these are pretty bad.They’re glorified markers. Don’t expect watercolors and to make a beautiful, delicate and classy painting with these. They’re just markers that write smooth bc of the constant supply of “ink”. You will still get the marks when you “color in” and see every stroke as you do with a marker. The colors are very strong, not the typical subtle watercolors, so if you make a mistake there won’t be water that can soften it, it’s sort of an nothing or all deal.I’m really disappointed, Im going to return them, it’s not worth the money they cost. I can paint with my prismacolor markers and at least they don’t leave a stroke.I tried painting something tonight and it was like when you put liquid eyeliner and you mess up so you try to fix it by adding more, and more, and more, and at the end it’s a train wreck. That’s how painting with these felt."
3904,1,"These are an absolute joke. They are almost all dry as heck... I read so many rave reviews, but I must say these fall very short of my expectations. These are essentially just markers with a brush tip. There is absolutely nothing ""Watercolor"" about these aside from the fact that is is a water based ink. I can't believe I threw away the packaging before actually giving all of the markers a shot, because I would definitely be returning them if not for the fact that I do not have the original packaging. Don't let the reviews fool you. Unless I got a dud batch, I absolutely do not understand the 3, 4 and 5 star reviews."
3905,3,"I had these for two weeks and didn't use them much. Any time i tried to use it I had to try really hard to get the color to come out. The first picture is just the swatches after alot of layering. the second one shows the swatches with one swipe of color and the one below it is after multiple layering. The water brush pen that comes with it lets out wayyyy to much water, kind ruins the piece, also it leaks from the side. These in no way replace Tombows (i only own 1 Tombow marker and its better than this). It also doesn't make art easier, just harder, the brush is hard to handle, hairs are out of place, and their just doesn't perform well."
3906,3,"The first thing I noticed about these pens was how cheap and light the felt in my hands. For the price and being a ""premium"" marker I anticipated a bit more weight to the product. They have the feel of a cheap knock off brand marker, not even close to actual fine tip Crayola markers which is what I had expected the barrels to be similar to. This makes me wonder how long each is going to last, as there can't be much ink contained in them. The ""brush"" tip is very firm and you cannot get very good calligraphy type lines with it but it is nice to color with and you can actually really minimize stroke lines so there is that. On good quality paper they look like regular water based markers with good pigment, still blotchy but that's pretty much a given unless you upgrade to alcohol based markers. I do like the colors but I wish there had been more neutral or lighter tones (really there are too many blues that are rather close!). I got these as markers I could throw in my bag and play around with in my bullet journal, and I think they will work fine for that but I think I could have gotten a regular set of fine tip Crayolas for less cost and been just has happy. My last comment is that I really like the tin, even if I'm storing them elsewhere, but I love tins for storage so I might be a little biased."
3907,2,"I bought these markers because I've been practicing hand lettering. I didn't expect these to be the best ever markers, but they left me completely underwhelmed and I'm planning on giving them away.Pros:*Mostly vivid colors* Nice tin* Good priceCons:* One marker was dried up (see 2nd picture)* Brush doesn't stay straight, but bends with pressure forcing you to rotate the marker in your hands as you write.(see picture)* Because each end has it's own color (and therefore, ink) I feel that these won't last long because only half of the barrel is for the brush end. So, if you're mostly using one end, they may not last as long as another marker like a Tombow. This is just a prediction, but it makes sense.Changes I'd like to see:* I wish the fine tip colors were just slightly darker than the brush color to allow you to use them for making patterns or accents within the larger strokes of the brush.*A slightly stiffer brush so you don't have to rotate it.All in all, these were okay, but I feel the brush bending will aggravate those who are just starting off with brush lettering. Nice idea by Crayola, but I don't feel it was well executed. I hope this helps!"
3908,3,"I received my markers today and was quite disappointed that the orange marker was dried out. There was a crack on the barrel which dried out the marker..this is the the reason I have only given 2 stars to this product. One of my biggest pet peeves is when I open a new marker or pen and it is dried out. So frustrating! I realize that these are crayola markers and was able to get the ink running by dipping it in some water, but why should I have to do this when I did not dry out the marker? Otherwise, I love the case and I like the fact that the bullet point is a shade lighter than the brush tip."
3909,3,"I bought this product to do light calligraphy with in hopes that it might be an adequate substitute to tombow fudenosuke brush tip dual pens. Boy, were my dreams shattered when I bought these and tested them out. They are very hard to control and have a creeping effect on paper (they seep slowly outwards producing blurry lines). Calligraphy is near impossible with the brush tip. Also, it makes little sense to have pens with different colors on either side of them because they could have been used together to created fine and thick lines but due to their differing shades, you can't. I'm severely disappointed. I expected more from crayola because their supertips are awesome. Maybe one day they'll come out with $10 superbrushtips. That'll be the day."
3910,3,"Personally I love art and take it seriously. I have been looking for a marker brand that suits me but, these markers were just a clear disappointment. I should have been smart, judging by my extreme hate for Crayola (Especially the crayons) I should of made the right decision and wished for a higher quality brand then ""Crayola"". To start off, a clear problem with these is that the brush tip is extremely flimsy and starts breaking within a few days. Another problem is that the small tip breaks up paper when used and it's extremely irritating but I guess that's what you have to deal with for a $11 product. Also the caps don't stay on easily and falls off unless an a extreme amount of pressure is applied, sadly, most of the markers dried out and are impossible to use because of those flimsy caps. on a high note though, the colors are great and have a beautiful color when I'm doing calligraphy but that's about it."
3911,2,"As I write this, I don't yet know if I will have to return this product. It might be damaged to the point of not being usable but the fault is not with the product itself. The problem is with Amazon and their choice of how to ship the mats.I have been quilting for almost 30 years and have used every kind of rotary cutting mat - including Fiskars mats - and one of the first things you learn is how quickly and easily these mats can warp - usually with permanent results. So when I ordered two (2) of the 24"" x 36"" mats from Amazon, I expected the mats to be shipped in a large, flat, thin box. Instead, Amazon chose to fold the mat in half and ship it in a box measuring 24"" x 16"" x 8"". That was irresponsible given the nature of the product.To compound the problem, did I mention that I live in Phoenix, Arizona and the mat was purchased and shipped in August? Couldn't Amazon foresee that might be a problem? The product is such that shipping the mats in such a manner is equally problematic for mats shipped to northern Michigan in the dead of winter. Call me crazy but I expected Amazon to have enough product knowledge to know how best to ship the products they sell.Since the mats were still very warm and somewhat pliable when I removed them from the boxes - yes, boxes... Amazon chose to ship the mats separately - I am cautiously optimistic that they might be flat again after laying on a flat table with other mats on top of it. If that doesn't happen, the mats will be returned and I will purchase these mats elsewhere.Just so you know, the mats do have an odor to them that is customary to any new rotary cutting mat. It is already disappearing. Let's hope the rather dramatic curve does too.And no, I am not overly concerned about the potential cancer-causing warnings. I have no intentions of eating or licking my cutting mat, and given the barrage of chemicals, food-related hormones and other carcinogens I encounter in everyday life, I doubt that my use of these rotary mats is going to be the tipping point. The dire warning labels are likely the result of some well-intentioned but nonetheless slightly overwrought crusading lawyer."
3912,1,"I submitted a previous review that was declined because I referenced a sticker that Amazon places on this item that leaves a sticky residue (yes, I’ll take that up with the shipper), but I’m glad it was declined, because now I can share that after having used this mat ONCE, there are permanent carved marks anywhere where I’ve cut fabric with my rotary cutter. I’ve owned Olga, Dritz, and even various off-brands of cutting mats and I’ve never seen it do this (see photos I’m including with my review).These were purchased at my request as a “gift”, so I can’t even return/replace with a different brand.WORST CUTTING MAT I’VE EVER USED!(FWIW, I have two of these bought at the same time. I thought maybe I’d just gotten a single “off” product, but I just checked the other one and it, too, has “carved” marks in it where I’ve used my rotary cutter. TERRIBLE.)(Note: you can also see the permanent sticky residue left by the stickers Amazon places on these mats— I’ve scrubbed it with Goo Gone, used vegetable oil, used soap, household cleaners, etc. Nothing will remove the residue."
3913,2,"I had read about the smell of this cutting mat, but some of the reviews said their mat didn't have a smell. So, I took a chance. I'm sorry to say that the smell was much too strong, even after airing it out, and I returned the two mats. Then I went to Walmart and checked out their mats which are identical to these, brand and all. They, too, had a strong smell. However, the smaller Fiskars mat (18"" X 24"") at Walmart didn't have the smell. It is also a self-healing mat, but it's a different color. I don't know if the color has anything to do with it, but I bought the smaller mat and am using it. Everything is fine so far. I don't think I have ever advised against a product from Amazon, but I would advise folks not to buy these Fiskars 36"" X 24"" mats if they don't like strong chemical smells!"
3914,1,"Despite some concerns about purchasing this due to the 'bad smell' reviews... we went ahead and bought one. The mat arrived today, and forgetting about the smell complaints, we set it up on our table and went to work. It only took 10 minutes for the whole office to notice the horrible smell. It just stinks like a paper mill (sort of sulferous), with overtones of Napthalene (moth balls). Scrubbed it with alcohol and soap water, leaving outside for a few days, and will return it if the stink hasn't left it by then! (Edited a few weeks later to say that the smell would never leave this product, so we returned it. Fiskars should be embarrassed to sell just junk. It could totally ruin any reputation they may have."
3915,1,"I bought this mat because it clearly shows that the numbers start with 1 on the right side. When I got it, the numbers start on the left. I am right handed and need the numbers to start on the right. I do have 1 I had gotten a couple of years ago with the number starting on the right. I love it!!! Its wearing out so I need a new one. Can't find them like that anymore. I can't return this one because they charge me $10.00 to return it. I have already returned one. PICTURE IS NOT WHAT YOU'LL GET. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
3916,3,"The packaging is labeled as ""permanent adhesive.""They weren't kidding about that part. It does provide a permanent bond to the fabric... but when bonding 2 pieces of fabric together, the bond comes apart very easily... leaving a very-hard-to-clean-up sticky mess. Unlike other brands of double sided tape, the tape is very thin and weak which makes removal terrible when the bond fails. I've at least been able to remove -most- of the mess by shearing it off with a stronger tape, like duct tape."
3917,2,"I wish I could give this ZERO stars. The backing didn't peel off. I inserted a needle to try to separate the backing away, and got it to pull away somewhat. But all I ended up with was adhesive all over my fingers. Maybe I missed something. I was using it to repair a sleeping bag with frayed seams, so I just used the one sticky side and then turned the edges and sewed through it. It DID help provide something to sew to. But I'm worried what will happen when we wash this sleeping bag WITH the full tape still in there."
3918,1,"I have a pair of slacks whose hem has started to come apart. As I do not sew and I did not want to go the expense of either buying a new pair of slacks, or having them professionally repaired, I opted to try this in the hope that it would take care of the problem. Although the reviews on this product were mixed, I decided to give it try. Unfortunately, the negative reviews were accurate. The sticky portion was very difficult to work with and bunched up and fused unevenly. I would have given it only one star, but in fairness, it at least worked well enough to cover the frayed portion of the hem and it was in an area not easily seen. I would have, however, been better off going to the expense of buying a new pair of slacks, either that, or trying an iron on hemming tape that does not get sticky until applying heat. I would not recommend this product at all."
3919,2,"i had such high hopes for this product! i’ve used the iron-on hemming tape for years with great success & thought this could be even better. i only wish i’d taken pictures!what a mess! the tape is SO sticky it made hemming a flowy dress hem a real challenge. as one reviewer said, it’s like crazy glue...stuck to my fingers much easier than to the fabric. i hung in there though & managed after a couple hours to get it done. then, a few days later, the real problem happened. i washed the hemmed dress with a couple other delicate fabrics...cold water, gentle wash. when i pulled the clothes from the washer the hem was out of the dress & there were little pieces of the tape, like little wads of glue, throughout the clothes. it took hours to pick all the little pieces out of the clothes , i had to cut an extra inch off my dress hem to get rid of the sticky mess & start all over. again, i wish i had taken pictures.i have been a prime member for a long time & do a lot of shopping on amazon to great success, but i’ve never written a review until now. this product just turned a hopeful project into a real pain in the."
3920,3,"According to the directions, you're supposed to peel the paper off of the tape once you attach it to the fabric, but that is absolutely impossible. The paper will not come off very well at all, and when you can get it off, it releases a very thin layer of not very sticky glue-type material that just clumps up and does nothing. The tape is very slightly sticky without removing the paper, and I tried using it with both the paper attached and not attached and the tape just fell right off.I know I only paid like $3 for this, but I want my money back, this product was SO bad. Very disappointing."
3921,3,"I LOVE MY CRICUT don’t get me wrong and I use it daily! I’ve spent and ordered literally so much money and have almost every product available HOWEVER, this Three pack of cutting “board “ was a mess! You can see as pictured that four full sheets of Expensive vinyl was ruined and the boards also!The boards were apparently way to sticky!I had a customer waiting and I could not help herloosing a $55 sale!Like I said usually quite satisfied normally, but definitely not this time! I would like three NEW boards and some kind of compensation for my iron on sheets, etc me of which was the new sparkle I believe was almost $15 so I’ll keep u posted and see what Amazon and cricut will do for me!Just, debbie."
3922,3," I normally buy these at hobby lobby the 2 pack. I saw that these were a pack of 3 for the same price and thought awesome I’ll save a little money! NO! These are half as sticky as the ones I’ve been buying at hobby lobby for the last year. I’m not sure why these are not as durable as the are both made by Cricut but be aware, that even though you get an extra Matt your actually getting a worse product than the ones you buy in store! I work with a lot of leather and faux leather, I use the transparent tape on the back and these mattes are pretty much useless for anything other than vinyl! The double pack at hobby lobby has never given me an issue like these have!"
3923,1,"While there were mixed reviews, I took the plunge and bought the set of three light grip mats because I mainly work with cardstock. My original blue mat has the flowers on it and works beautifully but I thought it would be nice to be able to load multiple mats for cutting. I couldn’t be more unhappy with this purchase. These mats are not only stickier than my original green standard ones but so inferior in quality that one has split after one day of use! Save your money and watch for flowered mats when they are in sale!"
3924,1,"Update: I stand corrected. These are apparently really made by Provo craft. I went to my local craft store and purchased a pack of mats and got the exact same thing. I'm very disappointed in the quality. I have a really old mat that cuts cleaner than these. I apologize for the first review but I stand by my review that they are bad quality. That however, is not Amazon's fault!!!! Sorry, Amazon!These are absolutely NOT made by Cricut. These are fakes branded as Cricut mats. There is a layer of paper under the initial layer of cutting mat. When you try to remove your item you cut out, the top layer of the mat scratches off. The photo was taken after one use. These are terrible quality! Pay the extra two bucks and buy them from your local craft store!"
3925,3,"I ordered a 3 pack of the standard grip Cricut cutting mats, sold and shipped by Amazon, so I felt good about the quality. On the very first use, my vinyl backing would not come up cleanly. It is overly sticky and the paper tears and leaves it behind. The only way to get it off of the mat is to use the weeding tool and scrape for 15 minutes. Nope, not happening. Its ridiculous!I have ordered Cricut Mats from Amazon before with the same result! That was last year, and I got a 2 pack of the 24"" mats. The first one was fine, but the second was just like this one. I feel like they must be seconds or defective items that Amazon is getting. Returning!"
3926,3,"This is really pretty(at first)!! Cuts very well on my silhouette. It was pretty easy to transfer it over to my phone case. My issue was that it looked really pretty for maybe 4 days, and then it started to peel, most of the actual vynil stayed on the phone case, but the shiny part peeled off the vinyl. now its been about 3 weeks and a lot of the shiny parts have peeled off, and what remains is a dark purple-ish color (not my favorite) So I just started peeling off the entire thing. Perhaps it is because the design I cut had smaller pieces? Not sure, but I don't really think its worth all the time, and money, to look nice for such a short time period.The first photo attached is from the day after I put it on my phone case. I forgot to take another picture before I started peeling off the design.. but the 2nd photo is of what it looks like now. A couple of the smallest pieces fell of on their own, the larger ones I peeled off myself, after the shiny part came off."
3927,3,"I ordered this package a few weeks ago and just opened it today, only to realize some of the colors advertised in the description were missing from my shipment. I have duplicates of a few colors in the package with seven assorted sheets and I am missing other ones that were described on the description page. I didn't receive the Opal White, Green Malachite, Hyacinth Blue, Peacock Blue, or hot pink/rose gold. Besides one sheet all of the rest are different variations of Orange and yellow. All of the vibrant colors that I actually needed are missing. It looks more like what you would receive if you ordered the package with different shades of Orange, the fairytale bundle I believe its called, instead of a mixed variety package I ordered. I really hope that somebody in the company will read this, so I will actually be able to get the colors I need still or they could just be shipped."
3928,2,"This is very pretty vinyl but a HUGE pain to work with. I had to do 36 turtles for a water bottle order. This vinyl (even on Washi tape setting ) would pull up the backing with it. I was not a able to put transfer paper on it and just lift it. As you can see in the picture, the majority of the little pieces of the shell I had to manually pick off. It was sooooo time consuming. I will never use this stuff again. Like I said it’s pretty but not enough for the complete hassle it was."
3929,3,"Immediately after beginning to unroll the vinyl, it started to crease and bubble. It was impossible to get a section that didn't do that and I unrolled a few feet to see if it got better. It's a pretty color, but a complete waste. To me it is unacceptable to have to cut a small 3""-4"" piece to make it usable. I want to cut a good 12"" piece and cannot get remotely close to having a 12x12 sheet that does not bubble. I am definitely not going to sit there and 'work out' the bubbles. It completely frustrating. Cricut's vinyl DOES NOT do this--I purchased them both at the same time and tested each. Something is weird about this vinyl. There were also fine scratches ALL over this vinyl--shown in a close up on the last picture."
3930,2,"This is the second time I’ve purchased vinyl from Tech wrap and the second time I’m frustrated. The first time I used the chrome sheets and when I went to pull the outside off and the letters wouldn’t stay put. I thought maybe it was because my blade was dull, so I purchased a new one. Cut to this time and using a new blade, I cannot get the letters to separate from the rest of the vinyl. It’s not user error bc I’m doing the same thing I would with other vinyl. Just wasted a bunch of money & heard nothing from customer service."
3931,2,"I am currently a medical student, and I use these pens every single day, sometimes upwards of 12 hours a day writing notes from lecture, underlining in books, or annotating. They last forever, and never dry out. I showed them to my class mates, and now the whole school walks around with them (literally, they are the very best. no smudging. no drying out. the tips are so fine and the quality is amazing). About every 6 months I order a new set, (but do the math... 10 hours a day average for every day for 6 months....these things last) When I had them in college a pack would last me a year. However, I just ordered another set, and was mistakenly sent a box of all black. This is the first time this has happened, but I don't have time to leave campus to go return the ones that were incorrectly sent to me. The only reason I am giving this a one star is because I am really hoping the seller (or amazon?) will correct their mistake so I don't have to go through the hassle of sending back the ones that were incorrectly sent to me. I usually order the assorted colors fine tip .2 mm. You should too. You won't regret it. Time to see if their costumer service is as good as their product...."
3932,3,"I bought several packs in all different sizes. All of them dried out within the first 5 min of using. I couldn’t even finish because they kept drying out. I bought a few 6 packs thinking it would last me a long time but they didn’t even last me a day. It’s obvious where they started to dry as my image goes from a really rich dark black to a wimpy gray-like black. I have a very light hand and was ultra careful not to bend the tips. I also stored some tip down overnight to see if that would fix it but no, they’re dry. Pressing lightly or hard, holding the pens directly vertical or using them on the side, nothing works to fix the problem. The paper isn’t the issue either as I’ve used other pens and sharpies without issue. (In my picture I used only this brand of pen, in several different point sizes.) There are two pros to these (1) they didn’t bleed through at all, unlike my sharpie ultra fines which bled a little and (2) the rich color and the fine lines from the tips are wonderful, for the first few minutes of use. Overall I’m highly disappointed in the price I paid for these to not even last me a day."
3933,3,"The 1st set that I got was on point, but that second set was not worth the paper I was writing on. I don't know what you all was doing nor what you was thinking about, but if I was the owner I would make them do them do it all over until they get it right or hire new employees. The reason you are just now here from me is because I am just now opening up my pack, when you press down on paper the little hole ink thing move and they are bent at the end. I need sum replacement. Thank you."
3934,3,"Sadly I am very disappointed. I by passed all the negative reviews to try these pens out for myself, I had high hopes. Unfortunately the pens were defective. This arrived to me on Friday, it is Sunday and already two pens have dried out. And I haven't even used them much! The ink in general isn't smooth, it glides rather roughly when drawing, I don't like the texture of it. Ordered the 05 hope it works better than the 005. Will post an updated review after it arrives.P.s. Shipping also takes awhile."
3935,3,***I am so disappointed in these pens. I bought them to use in my bullet journal and used each one maybe 4-5 times to decorate my journal... in the end all of the tips have bent making it difficult to write without the words liking like the pen is running out of ink. This is so frustrating as I am not at all heavy handed and am extremely careful with my writing utensils.***I received these pens two days ago and have used each pen 3 times. When I went to use the black pen again it was as if it was already out of ink and the felt tip seemed to be falling out. I hope the rest of them don't do this.
3936,1,"It doesn't stick! It's yellow, it's thick, and it... comes off on it's own accord. It's a lot like painter's tape, but then it also can't be used like painter's tape. I'm not sure what I'd compare it to. It came off cardboard, it came off a puffer jacket, it came off shoes. It's actually kind of useless. I'm sad because I bought it for a halloween costume in 3 great colors. The colors are lovely and bright. It felt thick, but it wont stay attached. True to duct tape I tried to use it a few other senarios (got kids? need duct tape), it was a no go. What the heck. It is sticky, but it's not something you can really use for much. The white tape ended up being kind of see through, so I had to use 2 ""coats"" for the desired effect. Now it's stiff like a board, sticks to itself fine. More like electrical tape. Has a bit of stretch and only kind of sticky. If you want to use it because it'll come off, beware it'll leave a residue."
3937,3,"Am I crazy? I think I'm going crazy. This tape doesn't stick to anything! I bought it to help rig the window kit for my A/C unit and to also help maintain cords and wires for our computer desk. I also ended up using it in some crafts. I bought two different rolls and have been using both so it's not a bad apple. this tape falls off anything I stick it to within 24 hours!! It's absurd. My other purple duct tape works fine, it's just unsightly. I don't get it. It's not hot or humid where I am and be surfaces I'm putting the tape on are clean. Very disappointed!"
3938,1,"The tape is terrible. It sticks to the roll and it's impossible to tear off clean. Instead, only a narrow strip pulls off and the rest stays on the roll. When I did manage to get a sufficiently large piece off the roll, it doesn't stick to anything. Tried it on wood, glass, plastic ... the same bad results on all surfaces.I'm wondering if, as another reviewer suggested, the tape being shipped by this seller is old. I think it's also possible that it was stored in very hot conditions and that's why it is all stuck together on the roll.I ordered a roll of blue and a roll in green. Ended up throwing the blue away. A total waste of money.I switched to a roll of Scotch brand duct tape that I had previously purchased. It works perfectly.Recommendation: Buy Scotch duct tape. Stay away from Duck Brand duct tape."
3939,1,"A complete waste of money. DO NOT PURCHASE!Searched high and low for a duct tape that is available in a color that comes close to our vintage kitchenette chairs. This color was acceptable for that purpose. The seat covers are plain old vinyl but the back of each seat cover was tore open by our dog when he was a puppy and gnawing anything in sight. We figured the cheapest, easiest 'fix' would be to cover the entire back of each seat with large swatches of duct tape. Not the most attractive, to be sure, but the simplest and most effective.In any event, this tape has very poor quality adhesive. Nothing like what you would expect from anything that purports to be ""duct tape."" Perhaps ""Duck Tape"" is the more correct name since this stuff is quackery."
3940,3,"I am very disappointed with these pens as I did not receive the ones from the picture. I did not realize that the product description did not explicitly say which colors would be included in the package, but after looking through other customer images I can confidently say my package did not contain the right colors. I have 2 black, 2 red, 1 green, 1 pink, 1 teal, 1 purple, 1 dark blue, and 1 orange. No yellow or brown. I got these pens specifically for the yellow pen as I use this color in my color coding system for my classes. Will be returning."
3941,3,"Beautiful colors that for the most part don't smear or bleed through, but the tips split easily. One split the first day I used it, another split a couple weeks later. I now need to buy another pack from a different brand since I need several uniform pens in different colors. Too bad they have no durability.The pics show close ups of the tips of the dark blue (badly split) and the light blue (starting to split). You can see the thicker and doubled lines the split tips draw compared to the still intact purple tip. Also you may want to note the similarity between the purple and dark blue colors. Not easy to differentiate between the two colors at a glance. Sending this defective product back."
3942,3,"I have to say I love the colors. They all come out really well and don't bleed through. I also like how it writes but I hate that if you don't put the lid on precisely, you'll ruin the pen all together. It frays the tip.I'm down 2 pens in 2 days and others are starting to go in the same direction :(You really have to baby these pens or not they are pretty much done. I've had them for 2 days and used them to underline for readings and taking notes."
3943,2,"Okay, let's be honest, these pens were less than $6. Given the price, I really shouldn't have expected much. However, I've only had these two days and two of the pens have already broken & the ink completely stopped working in another. I wasn't two words into a sentence, when the felt tip part the pen split and the felt tip actually fell out of the other. Now, I know what you're thinking, but I was not applying undo pressure ... Just normal writing.The actual pen itself is very thin. Thinner than the LePen or Stabilo brand pens, which I guess is fine if you're like me and have small hands. If not, you may find these hard to hold. Additionally, the outside of the pen is made of flimsy, plastic that actually bends when you're writing. (Again, normal writing. Not pressing down firmly.) In one review, a lady said upon arrival she found they were not what she expected so she had given them to a grandchild to use. I can assure you, a child would break the tips off these pens in no time. The cap must be FIRMLY snapped back on and as ridiculous as this sounds, is no small undertaking. In my opinion, they are not worth $6."
3944,1,"Liked em at first but two big issues with them.1) The tip is delicate and the inside of the cap is designed in such a way that if you don't re-cap the pen carefully each time, you risk splitting the felt tip in two -- resulting in double lines when you write. I ruined 2 of them this way -- it's easy to do because you end up recapping them a lot since they are like markers and you don't want them to dry out by leaving the cap off.2) The writing on certain materials fades. I wrote something on a wall calendar about 2 weeks ago with the pink pen and just today I walked by it and it was like the writing disappeared. It just faded and you could not tell what had been written. It doesn't do this with absorbent paper (like a regular notebook) as far as I can tell, but on slightly glossy paperstock like what a wall calendar is made of, the writing will only last 2 weeks.Furthermore, the company contacted me and said they would give me a full refund if I took down this negative review. I refuse to contribute to the growing unreliability of Amazon reviews. They're really not terrible pens, just beware of these above issues.Edit Feb 2019: It seems to not just be glossy paper that this writing fades on, but also regular paper. Example pic attached (3rd pic). The common denominator seems to be exposure to light, so it seems this ink is not photostable."
3945,1,"I bought a pack of this to complete some Valentine orders for customers; I print on a BizHub toner printer. Suddenly, my graphics were grainy and faded. I spent 2 days trying different settings, thinking my printer was malfunctioning. Talked to a tech, spent time cleaning the printer, reinstalling drivers, and replacing toner cartridges, with no change. I finally decided to try 5 other paper stocks I had in hand (paper & cardstocks). Graphics printed perfect on every one of them. Ran the Neenah Exact Index Card Stock 110lb (this is not 110lb cardstock, by the way, it is 110lb index stock which is much ligher), and the graphics were faded and grainy again. Returned the paper, bought more generic (cheap) card stock from Walmart and I'm back in business. Don't buy this paper!!!"
3946,1,"This is NOT 110 lb Heavy cardstock. I compared it to a sheet of 110 lb cardstock that I bought at Michaels. The Michaels paper is much heavier. I did further research. The Michael's cardstock is 110lb/300gsm. The Neenah paper is 110lb/199gsm. This explains why the Neenah paper is so much lighter that what you expect cardstock of that weight to be. There are different categories of cardstock. The 110lb COVER paper-which is the MIchael's cardstock- is 298 gsm and the 110lb INDEX cardstock - which is the NEENAH paper- is 199gsm. It's confusing because both papers are 110lb. The 110 lb INDEX paper is the equivalent of 74 lb COVER cardstock. The listing should clearly state that this is NOT heavyweight 110 lb cardstock. If you want heavy 110lb card stock DO NOT buy this paper. The higher the gsm nunber, the heavier the paper is. "
3947,3,Not satisfied at all but I didn't have time to return the item. The ream of paper had been previously ripped open and retaped. Several sheets were soiled; looked like someone had walked on them with their shoes that is how dirty the paper looked. I threw away those pages. The quality of this paper is pretty rough and I haven't used it yet. I wanted a heavy weight paper for card making. The paper color is what I would call heavily creamed coffee; pretty yellow. I wanted something lighter.
3948,3,"I bought this product with the understanding that it was 110lb paper. I used to work in a commercial office supply place, this is clearly not 110lb paper. Not to mention I also received the same day 105lb paper from another vendor. The 105lb was definitely a much stiffer paper, what I expected. I am pretty sure that someone messed something up. I don’t know what the 110 is supposed to represent on the label but it is not the weight of the paper. I added a photo of a chart I found online. 199g/m2 is the equivalent of 53lb paper. Not what I was looking for. It is definitely listed wrong. There are multiple places in the listing stating it is 110lb paper."
3949,3,"I will start by saying the card stock is fine. The paper is not business card rigid, but close. I have made some business cards with it, but they are not as good as professionally printed cards. This will make good home made greeting cards and the like. My wife makes birthday announcements for the kids, the kids use it for school and fun, and I use it for dividers and covers in reports/files. It is great for all that and much more economical than getting the same stuff from the local Office store.However, the two stars is due to the packaging. I don't know if it was not secure in the box it shipped within and the weight of the card stock broke open the paper packaging around it, or if the paper packaging was torn when originally boxed up. But it arrived to me with the wrapper torn almost all the way around. This let about 1/3 of the paper to come out of the packaging and it was ruined by being bent between other items in the box. All the corners of the paper were also bent. I could only salvage about 1/4 of the card stock for any proper use. I guess the kids get the rest for coloring and good paper airplanes.To be fair I did not contact Amazon to give them a chance to do anything. I needed the paper for an immediate project so couldn't return it and for what it cost it wasn't worth the hassle of a return."
3950,3,"Absolutely love the colors in this set. I rate them in the ratio of colors and I would say this is a great combination.I really love my Ohuhu alcohol markers. While I'm not a huge fan of the chisel tip they do a great job with the small tip as well. And the chisel tip does stand up to punishment! I would say the colors are comparable to Copic's except for the lightfast property (which I am told they aren't equal but actually can't tell myself). They are beautiful colors. I am disappointed about them coming out with the set of 120 about a week after I bought the 100 set, but that is really the only complaint I have. I really want to love these pens too!Having said that they fail to do what I purchased them to do. I bought them to use for calligraphy. A good portion of the brush tips have gone mushy just swatching them. I would want them to be flexible but the color is separating and the points are impossible to get thin lines from. The black pen thin tip is mushy too. I used it to write the colors and lines on my swatching page. If you get these to use as colors in a coloring book or anything that doesn't require precision, this is a great deal and the colors are really nice. They just aren't good for calligraphy."
3951,3,"So if you are just using these for coloring books or something then they will work well. The problem lies in the advertising. They say they are brush tips and also that they can be used for brush lettering. There is a stock photo of brush lettering, but I know they didn't use this product for that. The nibs are hardly flexible and they came frayed. One of the nibs came compressed down so it looked like a flat topped bullet nib and had ZERO flexibility. These do activate with water nicely though and if you want them to use as watercolor type markers then they will serve you well I think. Just be careful with details. But they don't do well with thin linessl whatsoever. They can't do extra thick downstrokes either. You could probably get better brush lettering results with Crayola supertips. The fineliners are okay, a little dry in my opinion, but they work alright. For the price these aren't an awful deal but they definitely need to refine the advertising because these don't get as thin of lines as the advertisement shows. I've heard nothing but good things about Ohuhu as a brand and I've heard good things about their customer service. So I reached out to them to see if they would be willing to send me some of their real brush pens to try out for brush lettering, since I don't have time to go through the trouble of returning this set. They kind of beat around the bush a little bit saying that one of the listings for replacement I sent them wasn't their listing (but it was) and then finally they agreed to send me a 48 set of the real brush tip pens. So we will see how those go. But just be wary of these and know they are not fit for brush lettering cause they aren't flexible and they aren't durable when used with pressure. And they nibs aren't consistent. But hey, my daughter will have a new set of markers to color with I guess! "
3952,3,"Very up set and disappointed. I got these markers for my daughter for Christmas and we were both disappointed. We might have gotten a bad batch, but that is not an excuse for the carelessness of the product. Many of the markers fine tips were dead or broken. And some of the brush ends didn’t even have ink in them. Overall this was a bad purchase and I hope it can either be refunded or I can get another kit for my daughter. Made Christmas very upsetting as it always is with a bad gift."
3953,1,"Sadly, we’ve only used 10 of these and they have all leaked! My daughter paid for these herself with allowance she earned and was excited to use them for Art time in class. She actually came home crying because she got it trouble for these pens leaking everywhere and staining the classroom desk. Out of the 10 we’ve used all are leaking a ridiculous amount. Of course I want to return these for a refund so my daughter can use her money on something else as I am not taking a chance on the others leaking and staining more things but the return window has closed! I would appreciate the company reaching out to us to fix the issue. In fact, two other girls from her class have had their moms contact me for the link to this product to order because the girls all want to have these in class. I will be letting the parents know not to order because after 3- 4 uses they will leak and be useless."
3954,3,"For the most part, I really liked these markers. I liked that the tip was firm, without much give. This allowed me to do special coloring. The reason for one star is the lack of colors. I ordered because the colors showed were really pretty colors. I did not get these colors. I got six orange and eight red with very little color variation. The rest of the colors are muddy The markers are not smooth and the paper is rough after coloring I am very disappointed in having to send them back because I had hoped for markers with beautiful colors. I may do a reorder to see what I get. Ohuhu has a excellent reputation and many artist use them of You Tube."
3955,3,"I am an established artist and frequently use art markers. I have been looking for a less expensive alternative to my regular ones, so I tried Tombow. While the colors are nice, these markers do not blend well at all. If you have to color a large area, they leave uneven marks where the color overlaps its self. They also tend to tear up the paper, no matter how light of a touch you use, which surprised me. I did try these on different types of art paper and never got a good result. I'm very disappointed."
3956,3,"Really wanted to love these..Just such trash. Seriously think my crayolas work better!Firstly they're water based so I knew what I was getting, I wanted them to blend nicely with a bit of water. But this pack is such a mess. Maybe all the positive reviews gave me too much expectations. this set is good for children messing around NOT good quality work, not even good for practice. And far to expensive for child's play.PROS:- Brush pen is nice!- Very affordable- Large variety of shadesCONS:- This pack doesn't know if it wants to be a cool, warm or neutral grey! They should have all been the same tone because they don't match up and look strange next to one another.- The color on the caps doesn't match the ink. The dark colors were fine, but 5 of the lighter shades were not as they appeared. a light cap would have darker ink than the ink in a darker cap. Gotta swatch.- The blender isn't very effective. And is too harsh on the paper, bringing me to my next problem- The nibs & ink EAT away the paper so bad! If you layer too much ink the paper will get soft & crumbly. If you try to blend any too markers together even heavy press paper will start to flake & warp.- The ink is super streaky. No matter how fast and smooth I layered it just wouldn't dry a solid color. And if I tried to add another layer to thicken/blend it the paper gave way.- The colors don't look nice. Thy're not vibrant. I mean they're greys but if you've ever used black India ink or grey copics, primacolors or Twin Touch markers you'd know they have life. the colors are solid and true and look bright.Anyways they might be worth you trying out. but they weren't for me :/ Guess I got what I paid for, investing a bit more is worth it."
3957,1,"If you are wanting, as I was, a set of nine pens of gradations of grays from the darkest-dark to the lightest-light, all in the same color family, do not buy this set. It is a mix of cool grays, warm grays, a French gray, and, even more bizarre, a pen with a color closer to a Lilac as you'd find, for example, in Prismacolor's color line of markers. As I was picking up the contents of my own set after studying them, I realized I truly had no use for them. So, rather than take them to my studio where they would only gather dust, I tossed them out. I truly have no use for them and feel that Tombow advertised them in a way that would sell well -- but either to unsuspecting buyers like me or, worse, to aspiring artists not yet trained well enough in art to know there are different families of grays. Because of this, many inexperienced artists may think these pens are helping them grasp the concept of working out a composition in values found on a grayscale, but the gradations of value found in a properly executed grayscale are not in this set. If you want to learn what different types of grays there are, this may be a good set for you, but, if you're expecting to receive markers that are representative of a true grayscale (markers that will help you to accurately pre-plan the value-structure of a serious composition), you won't find it here."
3958,3,"I am an established artist and frequently use art markers. I have been looking for a less expensive alternative to my regular ones, so I tried Tombow.

They also tend to tear up the paper, no matter how light of a touch you use, which surprised me. I did try these on different types of art paper and never got a good result. I'm very disappointed."
3959,3,"I regret buying these pens. The colors they produce are nothing like what's on the cap, so I had to make a little chart displaying what each pen would actually produce. On top of that, the pens color like a glorified Crayola marker. They make dark streaks if you draw a line over another, and the blending marker does absolutely nothing. They tear up the fibers of the paper and bleed through, chewing up the paper.The only time these pens produced a decent result was when I used them as detail work on a watercolor paper canvas. Using these for an area larger than a stroke is a bad idea, though, and it brought down the quality of the piece significantly."
3960,2,"I was looking forward to putting all our pictures in a family photo album; however, once I received the album I realized that the pages are not big enough for an 8x10. I am going to look for additional pages that I can add to the back, nonetheless, it was very disappointing. Another downside which is probably just nit picky - the pages stuck together. So when I presented it to my husband and he flipped through it there was about 6-8 blank pages I skipped over. I will not be buying anymore."
3961,3,"Although I have two college degrees, I guess I am not very smart. I cannot see any way to open the pages to place pictures underneath the clear plastic. I do not want to go through the hassle of returning the album if it is even possible to return it after it has been opened. Also, I do not want to tear up the pages trying to slide pictures underneath the plastic coverings. I guess I will have to place pictures loosely inside the album. That would be better than no album at all. I have some old cards with pictures of race cars on them that I had planned to place in the album but now I am going to leave them loose and find a good plastic envelope that is large enough to hold them. An album is obviously not going to work. I had really hoped to be much more satisfied with this photo album."
3962,3,"If you pay more than $5 for this you've been taken. I can deal with the fact that the book is just plain ugly- I purchased it for the functionality, of which it has none. The pages have almost no adhesive on them so good luck getting anything to stick, and the clear film is akin to the cellophane that a pack of gum is wrapped in. It is so paper thin that on the first pull open it left permanent creases and marks in the plastic. But the best part (and yes I'm being sarcastic) is that the pages themselves are 2 inches smaller in circumference than the binder. So you have this giant ugly book with these tiny little pages!?!? I have other old skool photo books that have sturdy pages with good adhesive and decent clear plastic covers. This book unfortunately is no where near that quality."
3963,3,"Love the pattern and color. Much nicer than anything I've found in local stores. However, product is poorly made. I ordered 4 of these. 3 out of the 4 arrived broken. The packaging was fine so it wasn't an Amazon shipping issue. The box was intact and there were plastic air pouches inside to keep product from shifting around in transit. The problem was a manufacturer defect. The 3-ring metal portion that holds the pages is supposed to be attached to the exterior cover in 2 spots - bottom and top. 3 of the albums were only secured on one end. The other end was detached and just flops around when you open the cover. I needed 4 matching albums so I returned all 4 of them."
3964,3,It would have been fair to mention that the album will not take an 8X10. It was deceiving when the description states that the pages are 8.5x10.5. That’s true if one measures from the edge to edge but you can’t put the photo to the edge because of the three holes. Even trimming my photo to 7.5 inches so it would fit I found the plastics overlay is about 2 and 1/2 inches too short in width to cover the entire photo. Cheap price but lacks what I bought it for. Description is misleading.
3965,2,"So very disappointed with this replacement mat. The mat sticks so strongly to the medium (vinyl, HTV, cardstock, contact paper, freezer paper) that it has literally pulled the adhesive off the mat and destroyed the design. The original mat that came with my Silhouette is still doing fine, just kind of beat up from lots of use. I'm getting ready to start a sizable project for church and that is why I wanted a replacement mat, so I could keep a cut going without down time. No where does it say that this is a second quality product or a rejected first quality, but it certainly appears that way and I m very frustrated about it. I have a new 12x24 mat ordered, it should be here today. I hope it does better. This purchase was definitely a waste of my money."
3966,2,"This mat is awful! I've used a lot of these over the years and the last 2 I've purchased have been terrible. The first one I did what I always do and press it on a cushion to destick slightly. The mat was ruined, I could not get the vinyl off to save my life. I had to throw it in the garbage. I ordered another one, same thing happened. I've even left it out hoping for dust to settle or something! I cannot use it effectively. Also, the edges of the mat are rippling. The plastic is separating from itself. I've never had any of this happen with these mats. I understand it is probably not the sellers fault, but the product itself. However, this product is awful."
3967,1,"I purchased this item because of the price without reading reviews and realized that this great deal IS counterfeit. The packaging looks VERY different from the ones at the store. I use my Cameo at least 4 times a week for my business on Etsy, I promise you, this mat declines in its purpose very very quickly.In my photo comparison of the packaging, the Bottom retail packaging is a different blue, looks faded, and smaller font. The mat above is from Joann’s.The mat worked fine for me after a couple hours of cutting.... after that, my cardstock and vinyls kept popping off and is now not sticking at all. I seriously opened it a couple hours ago WTF. What a waste!!!!The adhesive of this mat is noticeably less sticky as the original mat from Joann’s. The price LOOKS like a deal but it’s not. I recommend buying mats from reputable sellers, Joann's, Michaels, Hobby Lobby, Silhouette website. Not 'Silhouette America' on amazon."
3968,1,"I have ordered over 200 of these mats since I began buying them on Amazon in 2013 for my small business. Until recently, I have never been disappointed in the 12x12 mats - they were always high quality and had a good life expectancy. However, for the last 6-7 months or so, EVERY SINGLE mat I have ordered on Amazon (30-35 total) has been defective. Additionally, 18 out of 21 mats I received directly from Silhouette were defective. The adhesive on the mats comes off after one use. It comes off on my projects. It rubs off using the scraper. It bubbles, it splits, it pulls, it is terrible. On a few occasions, all of the adhesive came off on the blue cover paper and none was left on the mat!Every single mat that was defective had the same manufacture date - 11/08/16. The three mats I received directly from Silhouette that were not defective had different manufacture dates. Silhouette America is well aware of this is issue. They have said as much in correspondence to myself and other customers. So, my question is - why are they still selling these defective mats? Why am I still receiving mats via subscribe and save with this manufacture date? Why have they not pulled the 11/08/16 mats from Amazon? I would imagine that this is very possible - expensive for sure but doable and yet it is not happening. Has anyone also noticed that the price on these mats started dropping in Jan/Feb and were almost 50% off for two months straight? If you look at any website that tracks price history of Amazon products, this can be confirmed. These mats have never, ever been priced so low for such a sustained period of time - the historical stats also bear that out.In my opinion - I think they are trying to get rid of as many of these crap mats as possible through this apparent fire sale here on Amazon. Because even if some of us return these defective products, there are some that can't or won't. That helps them offset what must be huge losses for this bad batch of product. There is no other reason I can think of why a company as large and capable as Silhouette America has not been able to get these defective mats off the shelves for over half a year and I, for one, find it infuriating. Take your losses Silhouette and stop trying to pawn these terrible defective mats off on your paying customers!"
3969,1,"Not the classic Silhouette mat like what comes with the machine!! It's a cheap alternative with a way too sticky adhesive initially, and then it doesn't hold worth anything once you try to de-sticky the mat like the classic ACTUAL Silhouette mats. I've been using my original Silhouette mat for several months and decided to replace mine with this one because of cost. They are totally different materials and adhesives even. The blue paper that ""protects"" the mats adhesive area should stick somewhat to keep things from sticking to it when not in use, but it slides right off this one. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone!"
3970,3,"A cheap option that will suit many users. The caps don’t even come close to the actual ink colors so you need to be prepared to create and work with a color swatch chart to find the corresponding color each time. If the numbering system were a little more detailed it might help some. teh wide ranges of greens and pinks would make this set better suited to florals and landscapes than portraits (only a few skin tones are included). I received this as a gift and, as someone who has quite a collection of markers I am not sure I'd buy these again, but for someone starting a collection, this could be a good start. Some seem to be 'juicier' than others so I'll be intersted to see how long they last with regular use."
3971,1,Firstly the bullet nibs are very hard to use and I’m not a fan of the chisel nibs but I knew that I was getting those nibs when I ordered. I’m am however really dissatisfied with the amount of yucky poopy like colors that look like they just threw a bunch or inks together and called it a day and put no real thought into how the color portrays on the page. I emailed them and this is the colors of their markers so I guess I’m just not a fan. I just recommend you do your research before investing making to sure you’ll be happy with the color options. Great markers for a budget or beginner tho. Nice and juicy and I’ve found no dry markers yet.
3972,3,"I purchased and made swatches of these markers this past April, 2018. I was thinking of using them at the end of July, 2018, so I pulled the swatches. Many of the colors had aged to the same dark color! I had put them on both white and black-backed paper because I knew that the different backgrounds changes how the colors look. The pages were kept either in a notebook (white) or Jade Summers Color Charts book (black-backed), so they were not exposed to sunlight. The darkening happened on both types of paper. I didn't count how many of the colors did this, but it's definitely more than 10. I'll probably keep those colors that still look OK, but I wouldn't have purchased the set if I'd known this was going to happen. Lasting less than three months isn't normal (my Sharpie collection still looks fine)."
3973,1,"I bought the 100 pack of Caliart markers and returned them soon after. I was incredibly disappointed in these markers. (I'll keep it kinda short for Amazon, but I may do a longer review at my site.) Let me list the problems I had with them:1. They smell significantly louder than any other brand of alcohol markers I have. Most alcohol markers have some type of light scent but these were noticeably louder.2. There are too many dark and saturated colors, and not enough pale, pastel and light colors. Viewing the images of the pens on Amazon, you wouldn't able to tell this fact because of the cap colors.3. Entirely too many of the cap colors were significantly different than the actual marker color. Making a swatch sheet is very necessary, but using markers should never feel like blindly picking colors. And never let anybody make you feel stupid for asking for a better color match between the actual ink and the cap.4. Over a dozen of them already had the number fading off the top.Look, I'm not expecting perfection from cheap markers. I love the cheapy TouchFive markers and their many versions. (The ""Touch Soft Head"" is my fave of the TouchFive line). But, again, with Caliart there were too many problems to deal with. Like...pick one thing to cut corners on; not everything!If you're looking for a cheap marker, do yourself a favor and try to get the Touch Soft Head markers (or any of the Touch-brand markers). Or, spend just a little more for the Finecolour BRUSH markers (the black ones that say ""EF102"" are the BRUSH version.)https://www.amazon.com/Finecolour-Markers-Colored-Drawing-Artists/dp/B0728KS3QM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1511327740&sr=8-1&keywords=finecolour%2Bbrush&th=1It's rare for me not to recommend a marker because they all pretty much function the same at the end of the day. It's the build and the type of nibs that really determine if it's a great marker. But, I can't recommend the Caliart brand."
3974,2,I bought these markers hoping they'd be a good intro into using alcohol based markers and because I wasn't willing to spend that much on copic markers just yet. I am a beginner and watched various tutorials and even attempted to use rubbing alcohol to blend better but was not successful. These feel like regular crayola markers - very average and not worth the price. I would not recommend this product if you're looking to create artwork with blended colors. These would work well for a coloring book but not for advanced artwork.
3975,3,"These stencils do the trick for the $5 it costs. Some of the stencils are a bit repetitive and the same shapes show up more than once. They're a little bit thin, so you have to press down to really anchor it down to trace or else it'll slip on paper. I would have given it a higher rating if not for the horrible smell. I can't even begin to guess WHAT it's from but what it is is atrocious. I'm from a major metropolitan city and even the homeless smell more tolerable. I would return it but the couple of dollars isn't worth the hassle. TBD if lysol gets rid of the smell; if it doesn't, I'm throwing them out since I can smell the stench when walking by the stencils!"
3976,3,"It's ok but definitely not high quality! Some of the shapes weren't punched out all the way, some were bad enough they ruined the stencil when I tried to take them out. Some of the shapes are so small you can't fit a pen or pencil in so your freehanding the rest of the shape, which defeats the purpose. Many others had burrs and sharp parts that ripped the marker I was using. The selection of shapes was good but I was disappointed at how many were repeated (2 or 3 Facebook icons, etc)."
3977,3,"Disappointed for several reasons. 1. While I received 20 stencils, they are all mostly the same things. It's hearts, stars, circles, ribbons, and banners on nearly every one of them. I guess they would be cute for journaling, but definitely not for calendar-type planners. I was looking for stencils for my day planner, things I could use for baseball games, doctors appointments, haircuts. There was nothing for sports at all, no bbq grill, no beach waves, no fireworks. So boring. And also, most of the items are too big for a calendar square.2. The stencils are numbered. I got two #9 stencils and no #13. Looking at the picture here on Amazon, it seems #13 had the best stuff on it! When I emailed the company to ask what could be done, they told me to contact Amazon. The only option for me on Amazon was to exchange it for a new order and hope for the best. That would mean I'd have to go out of my way to a UPS store and I'm not going to go to all that trouble for a $6 item that I don't even like. Maybe I would have liked the set more if I'd gotten the #13 stencil, but since that won't send one out, I guess I'll never know. It's a cute idea, just not for me."
3978,1,"Very flimsy and hard to trace with for a couple of reasons. One being they bend and move so you really have to press and hold down hard so you dont mess up. Two, the smaller ones are harder to trace and just don't come out right, if you can manage to trace any. This was my first time buying stencils so maybe I'm being a little harsh but I expected more and for the reasons I gave two stars not to happen. I got what I paid for, lol! I'll keep trying but don't think I'm going to spend money trying to figure out which ones are good on Amazon. So I'll try next purchase in person! I would say thouh 20 stencils for the price, try it and see if your opinion is different from mine. What I dont like, you just might!! The good thing is if you dont like it and we share the same opinion about it and you agree with me, you didnt pay lots of money to check it out for yourself!! Lol! I truly hope this helps!"
3979,1,I would not recommend these. Not high quality. Some of the designs are so small that even the pens that were recommended to be purchased with them will not even work—the “holes” are almost too small for the very fine point pens to be used. I ended up having to “free-hand” some of the designs to try to make the “lines” more “crisp” and not seem “uneven”. I am so disappointed in these. I was so excited when I saw them and when I decided to purchase them. I was excited when I got them and was excited until I used them. I did try them several different times in case I just needed “practice” but I still had the same results. I am returning them.
3980,3,"Order came quickly but despite showing different in the photo... Every single color is Matte! Had I known that I wouldn't have ordered it. And I didn't notice until I opened them all and painted the tops, so I can't return them. I need glossy for my mandalas/pouring so no idea what I'm gonna do now. Very frustrated! I apologize that the pictures are colors mixed from both the bulk apple barrel sets you can buy on here, but BOTH came matte when pictured showed non matte so will be leaving same review on that one too!! Pretty much money down the drain for me. <U+2639> if you're looking for matte however, these colors are great for the price! So they get one star for that, heh."
3981,3,"I received two of the Flag Red and no Jack-O-Lantern orange. Also, some of the paint bottles came with way less paint in them. I weighed the bottles with my kitchen scale, and the heaviest two were 3 3/8 oz. Most of them were around 2 3/4 oz, but a few (like the Bright Yellow) were only 2 1/2 oz. I can't say how heavy the bottles themselves are without paint in them to know if each bottle had at least 2 oz of paint in it, but I'm guessing the lighter ones were lacking.As for the paint itself, I've only used them once for some small detail work. I had a little trouble with coverage, but that could just be my own skill level versus a problem with the paint. The do seem a little watery to me, though, compared to Reeve's."
3982,3,"I purchased this set back in March of 2018 after not being able to find this brand at Michaels or JoAnns. Little did I know they sell this at Walmart (or at least at the one by me) for 50 cents a bottle. So this set on amazon is way overpriced. Most of the paint was great - nice consistency and coverage. A few colors (red, yellow, and orange) were too thin and watery and I had to replace those. The white was a little chunky and didn't flow very well. I would pour a little into a cup, add a drop or two of water, and the problem was solved. BUT I don't think I should have had to do this. Anyways, I paint rocks and this set was a nice starter but I have added to it a lot since I don't like to mix colors."
3983,3,"This is not water soluable. My gdaughter came over and was painting. She got up a had her art work by her side and it on a new pair of white shorts. Impossible to get color out. Tried bleach, bleach paks, bleach tubes, etc. Supposedly soap and water takes it right out of where you got paint on osomething and it sure does not. Amazon asked me to write this so it does not happen to anyone else. Company should be notified and either make it a washable product or say it is not washable."
3984,3,"The paint was very thin and took multiple coats to get into the pores of the canvas. It reminded me of nail polish. I think it would be satisfactory for beginning artists, and the color variety is excellent;however, I now have an enormous quantity of paints that I find frustrating and worthless. I mixed it with various gel mediums to thicken the paint, but that did not improve the paint enough for me. It still felt dull and streaky. I would purchase it for a niece or other artist not overly concerned with outcome. The price for the quantity is definitely a bargain for this grade of paint."
3985,2,"My middle-schooler compared this pencil sharpener to the Prismacolor Scholar Colored Pencil Sharpener (1774266) that she's been using. (I was going to order another one of those, but the price doubled!). She says this Staedtler one sharpens just as well as the Prismacolor, but that she likes this one because it has a screw top. She says this will be nice, because when it falls on the ground, it won't spill shavings all over. This one, of course, is round, so it can't sit on it's side like the funny-shaped Prismacolor. Due to this design, it may be more prone to rolling off the desk in the first place. But, when it does, the top won't pop off. We'll see how it compares over the course of this term. The Prismacolor has kept it's sharpening ability longer than all the others near this price-point that we've tried. So, we'll if this one does, too.Update 2/5/15: After less than a month of actual use, my student came up to me and said ""Look at what this sharpener did to my pencils."" It munched an entire box of her colored pencils. I can't believe she kept trying after it did this to even one! This Staedtler has lost it's edge, and is useless as a sharpener now. I've downgraded the stars from 5 to 1, and we'll be going back to the Prismacolor. It's too bad, because she liked the screw top that kept the shavings in place until emptied."
3986,1,"This product is complete waste of money, it distorts and unevenly sharpens and is difficult to even turn your pencil in it. My faber castles and staedltler art pencils Are all chewed and deformed. I'm better sharpening with an razor and sand paper, or my prisma handlheld is better. Made in Germany, I didn't expect a crappy little blade worse than some of the freebies I've gotten with some of my general's charcoal pencils! I thought this would work decent since I buy quality art supplies from this brand and my electric sharpener, which I loved busted out after under a years use, but this was a waste of 4 bucks. Get a garbage can and just a little handheld sharpener because this is literally all this is junk is."
3987,3,"Ordered 2 of these. One was for my toolbox with art supplies, and the other was to stay at home in my studio. I've been using the one out of my toolbox for months and it was great. Today I went to use the one at home because my toolbox was left at my other studio, and the one at home doesn't work. It literally doesn't work. It's a piece of metal with a blade screwed to it, and when you insert a pencil (I've tried about 6 different ones) and turn it nothing happens. How do you create a simple machine with only 2 pieces that doesn't work? Back to using my knife to sharpen pencils I guess."
3988,2,"We ordered two. One already broke after a couple of weeks of use. The sharpner broke off from the lid. I was hoping these would be more robust given the brand. The sharpener gets pencils very sharp. Too bad the connection to the lid is weak. Also, I got these for kids to use since they screw on instead of popping open. I wanted to avoid kids spilling the pencil shavings. This does work better than sharpeners that snap open and close, but it only takes a quarter turn or so for the lid to come off. Bummer."
3989,2,"I specifically purchased this pencil sharpener to reduce the amount of material lost when sharpening my quality (expensive) Prismacolor colored pencils. I used it only once and never again because it did just the opposite: it chewed the pencil up and it had BARELY begun to reach the lead when I removed it. I was NOT a happy camper when I saw this as it wasted a significant length of a quality colored pencil and had not even started to shave the pencil lead to a point. I have not used it since, as I am not interested in a repeat performance."
3990,3,"I purchased these in January of this year and wished I had looked at the extra refills. The colors are unique and beautiful and write smooth, I needed to refill a few that were my favorites. This month I opened the refills and found some that the gel was seperated in several areas and found out that they would not write. I went back to ask the seller if he could replace the ones in the pictures. Due to the return policy from Amazon I have no idea how to contact the seller not his fault but Amazons. If the seller reads this review I am hoping they are willing to replace the ones shown, if they do then I will be willing to change the rating to a five star."
3991,3,"The pens themselves are awesome-great variety of colors and truly no duplicates and color beautifully. However, I chose this set specifically because the description bragged about the ease of refilling with NUMBERED refills included. I did get the refills but no one in my family can read the number either on the pen or on the refills. I thought it just might have been my old eyes, but even my 8 year old granddaughter could not read the numbers, even with a magnifying glass. I can feel the raised characters on the barrels, they are just unreadable. I don't understand why all gel pens that come with refills don't have a numbering system? I am truly disappointed that I thought I had found the one company that recognized what a chore it is to try to scribble on scrap paper hoping that you get the right refill. Will this prevent me from buying this set again? I'm not sure yet. I love that there are 100 different glitter colors, but some of them are close enough that I wouldn't want to run out in the middle of a design element that should all be the same color. It's a bit of a gamble that I'll get the right refill."
3992,3,"I have quite a few sets of glitter gel pens, and this is the first picture I colored with this set. I included a photo of the colored picture, and a photo of the pens and how much ink was used with each pen. The orange colored pen on the end is one that was not used. I placed a pen next to the colored picture for reference as to the size of the colored picture. I am quite disappointed at how much ink was used! These few pens are the only ones I have used from the set so far, so I am not able to comment on the other pens in the set. I will say the pens I used worked well enough, but after a few uses, I will need to find the refills."
3993,3,"Like the idea of sparkles /refills includes for all the pens. It's been my experience that the color of the pen cap, supposed to indicate (closely) what the pen color is....I was disappointed, little over 1/4 of the pens, we're not close to color indicated by the lids, making it difficult to ensure the correct lid. Therefore, I would like to suggest that the refill number be indicated not only on the cap, but also on the pen it self. ...Overall I enjoy using the pens.I only found one pain that was unusable.... If you receive a pen and it appears that the ink is dried out - try lightly tapping it against a hard surface, 9out10 times just dried at tip...."
3994,2,"I received these as a gift. I love to color and was excited for a new pack of pens with what sounded like so many colours. But when I opened the package, I realised that the pens were all so similar in colour that it felt I had green, pink, yellow, purple, blue, red (only one), orange, silver, and brown. There may be one or two more but because the shades are so close in colour, the variety is actually very very slim. My sister who gave them to me also bought herself a set and she didn't like the colours either. I'm not sure why there are so many positive reviews except that you do get a lot of pens for the money. With the refills, I'll never need those ten colours again."
3995,1,"I'm shocked & dismayed at the poor quality of these batteries. I'm equally surprised that Amazon would put their name on them. They work for a very short period of time and that's only if you can find any that work at all. I thought that the price was too good to be true but I decided to purchase them because of the Amazon branding.. I have never returned anything that I've ordered from Amazon, and any problems that I have encountered have been with either the shipper or the seller. Please stop selling these batteries or take your name off of them."
3996,1,"I read a lot of reviews and convinced myself the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries were going to be a good buy. Nope. I put a pair in my TV remote, and within a month the TV was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power. I decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapper with my battery tester. 8 brand new batteries tested - all 8 in the red on the battery tester...not totally dead, but just inside the red. Next trip to Home Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer AA batteries and did the same test on them. 8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tester.Oh well, not worth crying about $13 worth of weak batteries. I am sure others have had great luck with the same AmazonBasics AA batteries. I just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision. Good luck!"
3997,3,"I've been buying AA and AAA batteries from Amazon Basics for a couple of years now. They recently changed the packaging (and presumably the manufacturer) and now they only last half as long. I tried a pair of Duracell AAs to test my hypothesis and they lasted almost three times as long. I wanted to stop buying these Amazon batteries, but it turns out that, at around $0.25 each and $0.90 for Duracell, they're still cheaper overall than buying name brand. However, it is extremely disappointing to watch them deliberately drop the quality and force us to purchase batteries more frequently. They've basically pulled a bait-and-switch with us, sucking us in with high quality batteries and then trading them out for lemons without dropping the price commensurately. Their packaging may be frustration-free, but these batteries sure aren't."
3998,1,"I was aware that AmazonBasics batteries would not be as durable as more costly batteries and I have used these in various devices over the last year.. However, I did not expect a leak which damaged a remote control blind valued at $1000. The AA battery was one of 36 required to power 3 large Hunter Douglas fabric blinds. Less than 2 weeks after the annual battery replacement, I found that a black liquid was oozing from one of the battery holders, downward onto the blind, visible from both inside and from the patio outside. I removed all 12 batteries which were all dripping the liquid (acid??). We don't know yet if any of this can be professionally cleaned and at what cost. Worse yet, the mess permanently dulled a large granite island nearby while cleaning the batteries and my hands. The Amazon chat representative approved a refund for defective batteries and a $50 policy credit. Conclusion: these are very inexpensive, low to medium quality batteries. Do not use them for any purpose or devices where leaks would be a concern."
3999,2,"I bought this item twice. The first time I was so disappointed at the poor quality I thought there must have been some kind of fluke at the warehouse. The level of power in these batteries was so low that they went dead extremely quickly. Because I have been a very happy Amazon customer for many years I concluded that a batch must have been misplaced in the warehouse and left so long they lost their power. So I bought a bulk batch again. This time the power level was so low that there were multiple times that I put new batteries in a remote control and they were dead when I put them in. And no, they were not stored at my house and lost their power. This happened within the first few months after the batteries were delivered. So I have determined that this has to be a pattern with this product and will never buy them again."
4000,2,"What a huge rip off! Just received box of 16 rolls of Bounty- quick size. Always buy select a size, but this time ordered quick size by mistake. They try telling you it is more sheets; they don't say that is only because they are smaller. They are also thinner. Today's shipment has 124 feet, while select a size has 142. Big difference! Very unhappy with this change! So much better when select a size available. Next time I need paper towels I will try some other brand. Have been Bounty customer ever since they started which is a long time."
4001,2,"With 6 children we have been using the Bounty half sheets for a long time. The price was good for the 16 pack using the $5 coupon and subscribe and save. These paper towels, however, are quite thin ( unlike our previous purchases of Bounty over the years ) and even though they are cut as half sheets the perforations are not uniform in that they don't go from top to bottom. We are constantly trying to get 1 sheet and getting one and a quarter or one and a half or two sheets. They almost never tear correctly. Its unlikely we will purchase this again because I have better options at Costco or other vendors packages on Amazon."
4002,2,"Mega rolls. Huge rolls. Super rolls. Family rolls. Giant rolls. Your head will spin trying to figure out which is the best value for your money if you are shopping for Bounty towels.These rolls are supposed to be the equivalent of 2.5 regular rolls but they have 20 some odd sheets less than the double rolls I have purchased from another brand which are just as good (but currently out of stock).Bounty will never see another nickel from me for their paper towels or their napkins.It takes a lot to get me riled, this level of deceptive marketing has risen to that level."
4003,2,"My wife and I did a comparison for this product with our club store for our subscribe and save. We agreed that when we originally did the cost comparison with this product we were supposed to get more than one box of 16 rolls. I thought that it would be good to add to our 4 products in the subscribe and save; however, when it was said and done the final cost was almost twice that of our club store and there was only one box of 16 rolls. I have it on notepaper showing the cost comparison and I would not have chosen this item at this price. We passed on many that were not a good deal, something changed after I added it to my list, and I have removed it from the subscribe and save. Not sure if it was a glitch, but not worth the money in my opinion."
4004,3,I swear by bounty paper towels and pay the extra $ because they have always been thick and absorbent - way better than competitive brands BUT the last shipment I received was different. These towels are not as thick and absorbent. What used to take 1 towel now takes 2. Bounty is a 2-ply towel and now the layers are separating from each other - falling apart. Never had this problem before. Proctor & Gamble hope this was an isolated incident and you are not going the way of many other manufacturers - giving the customer less value/quality.
4005,1,"Well, as others have stated, these should not be marked as flushable as I've had to just pay $240 to have my pipe rootered because they clogged my sewer pipe. I just purchased these this month and they were delivered on Jan. 21, 2019, today is Jan. 29, 2019 and it cost me more than my butt deserved to be cleaned. I could've bought another dozen underwear for that price!Do yourself a favor and just rinse off or wet the toiler paper slightly for a clean bottom, but don't buy these!"
4006,1,"I loved these wipes in the past. I have used them a long time. My recent order is a huge problem! The wipes shred as you pull them out of the container. When you use them, your fingers punch through the wipe. I do not have to tell you the result of that! Not acceptable!I thought maybe it is just this one pack. I am in my third pack and it is perhaps worse than the first. This has never happened before. I am left with the company is using poor quality materials to lower their costs! What else could it be? Plus......when you try to pull one out, it is so stuck to the next one, it tears and shreds. I have lost so many due to this issue that it is not worth buying them any longer. A few months ago I bought baby wipes just to check them out. They were so much cheaper and so much stronger. And I believe it I remember correctly, they were larger. And, they were very gentle to your down there parts. I will use the cottonelle wipes I have until they are gone and I will stop buying them and go to the baby wipes. Which by the way have a large quantity. I am very disappointed in Cottonelle. This company is better than this! I hope this review helps those of you considering purchase of this product. I am not one to complain but this is worth my taking time to help another not make a bad purchase."
4007,3,"seem to be seconds. They do not feed out of the packages properly. Like a box of Kleenex The edge of the Kleenex is in the center of the box so they feed out pretty much perfect. The edge of the Kleenex is in the center of the box so they feed out pretty much perfect. not these most of the time when you open them you can't even find the edge of the sheet because it's on the outer edge of the stack not in the middle. some have been good most of been bad. You can't use the package they come in because they will not feed out of it properly you have to buy a plastic wet wipes case, take stack sheet it through The case for to work properly and easy access when they get all snagged up."
4008,1,"These wipes don't dissolve. They are not flushable. They will be murder on your septic and pipes.That being said, the quality is kind of poor. They get stuck together and tear when removing.Be sure when using these, to wipe and throw them in the trash can. Not the toilet. I personally have a little garbage can that has a lid. You don't see or smell anything inside that puppy."
4009,1,"I can't believe how hard these were to open. You need a manual. These are not the flip up/snap shut ones. I could barely see an outline on the top of the package. But, I couldn't figure out how to peel it open. Yes, I used my nails. I finally had to rip it open and then I could grab the peel away strip. Well, that was a waste of one package of 42. It will dry out soon. How does a company put out such a terrible design. Some of these are advertised as unscented. Yet, the individual package doesn't say that. And there is a scent. UNSCENTED IS VERY IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF US! GET WITH THE PROGRAM. How about ""start peel away here"" on the package. You're welcome! And you don't even have to pay me for that idea. A monkey could have come up with that. My head is still shaking on this one."
4010,1,"I'm leaving a thorough and honest review because if you are considering switching, this is what I would want to know....I'm giving it 2 stars because it's both soft and absorbent, BUT....When I first purchased this in May 2018, the quality was much better than it is now. I had been getting this through Subscribe and Save for the last several months and pieces of it have been getting increasingly reluctant to remain with it's wadded up family as it travels down the drain. Okay....but seriously, this tissue is linty and that's just putting it lightly. Let me be more specific.....[SPOILER ALERT....it's tissue so this review is about #1 and #2, hair and stuff] I used to use Scotts and will probably be returning soon because I cannot with the lint and remnants despite my meticulous attention to my undercarriage. The only thing that I can truly say is a plus for this tissue it really operates under the ""Less is More"" rule. I can literally use 5 or 6 squares for ""certain"" things, whereas more than that makes it harder to be exacting with your use. So, the roll lasts forever, but by the same token, using such a little amount should make it easier to not leave anything behind. That's never the case and I'm smooth underneath. I can only imagine what furrier friends might endure.The feel of tissue is great, esp coming from Scotts one ply. It feels like night and day and when I first started using this I was in heaven. I was so impressed that I recommended it to friends and family. However, since then, it feels like they've change ""The Formula."" If it's not leaving lint behind, it's leaving much larger pieces tucked away. What's worse is the ONLY REMEDY IS SOAP AND WATER. You can't wipe it away, dust it away, and it never even comes off in your clothes. Just soap and water.So, if none of this bothers you, then you're good. Being a woman, I cannot afford to have anything throwing off my pH balance. So, back to the drawing board to find a better TP solution."
4011,1,"I'm a big buy, and I always get the strong toilet paper. I got this based on the reviews. The first time I used it, it fell apart. The second time wasn't horrible. The third time I was in a rush, had been behind schedule all day. I finally gave myself an entire minute break to use the restroom. Did my business, used this toilet paper, and because I was in a rush, had to take an extra two minutes to pull all the broken paper bits out of my butt. Don't bother buying this stuff, you'll probably regret it."
4012,3,"Not sure where this should go since it is a shipping issue not a product issue, but since I don't see a way to contact Amazon.com Services, Inc, I guess this will have to be a product review.We have a subscription for Presto Ultra-strong (which is great, btw, plenty of stars would be given), but received ultra-SOFT, which basically falls apart (earning a paltry number of stars). Opened it and started using it before I noticed... blurg...I hope this doesn't become a regular issue, b/c if it does, I'd have to stop subscribing."
4013,2,"I bought this because of the positive reviews and was looking for a no/low-lint decently strong but soft toilet paper. I usually really like Amazon products, and I don't usually write reviews (positive or negative), but this is the absolute worst toilet paper I have ever used. It disintegrates as you use it. I was going to try to use up what I have and then buy something else, but it's so bad that I'm going to just get rid of the remaining rolls and get something different. Really, really disappointed in this product and can't understand the positive reviews. Totally wasted my money on this one."
4014,2,"I read many reviews on this toilet paper and based on those excellent reviews, I decided to give it a try. I was quite disappointed to find the product did not nearly live up to its reputation. I found it to have poor absorbency, be extremely linty, and a little rough.Quantity wise, it is a good deal for price and the rolls are just as large as the Charmin mega rolls. A 24pk case is several dollars less than Charmin or Cottonelle, but this is a situation where you get what you pay for.Personally, I won't be buying this brand again unless I find myself in a severely financially compromised situation.TL, DR; Yeah, just don't."
4015,3,"This product is not for those with allergies. A brief exposure to this product caused my wife to have allergy symptoms for several days. Further the product ruined other several food items that came into contact with it that were not wrapped in thick plastic And those items with which it came into contact had to be discarded because of the acquisition of the smell. I am an outdoor person, and the smell from this was product was anything but outdoors. I frankly do not understand the excellent reviews. I do not even understand how this product can be sold without a warning label."
4016,3,"I find Bounce dryer sheets, or any scented dryer sheets, to be awful -- once you use them, the smell is in the article forever - can't get it out with vinegar, baking soda, washing soda, etc -- so many people use it that everyone is beginning to smell the same - both my neighbors' dryers vent into my yard - the smell makes me gag - I have to close the windows and put fans outside to blow the smell away -- I am wondering if the use of these kinds of laundry products aren't responsible for the increase in asthma in our children - and adults -and maybe the disappearance of bees? go to the website of the manfacturer of these prodcuts and ask for their ingredient sheets -- hmmm?"
4017,2,"First off, you should know that I typically just ignore all advertisements. I am going to buy what I am going to buy and no amount of hype will change my mind, but a few minutes ago, I had the distinct misfortune of catching one of your advertisements that was, and congratulations by the way because I truly did not think it humanly possible, more insulting and degrading than all the sexist, misogynistic Axe Body Spray commercials. I refer of course to your commercial about the couple who got fired from their jobs and have to protect their clothes because they can't afford new ones.How do you even get that IDEA that doing a commercial that mocks the harsh economic reality many Americans have been forced into is good, acceptable, or anything other than ridiculous gaff left over from the Romney campaign? Could you really not remove your heads from each other's sphincters long enough to realize that the odor was not, in fact, naturally occurring in your chosen environment but instead toxic waste that should have been aborted at conception. I mean honestly, while I would LOVE to see each and every person involved in the commercial appear on the Darwin Awards, do you really think that igniting whatever you were smoking in such a methane rich environment is a good idea?Congratulations, Tide, Bounce, and Downy, on becoming the first products that I refuse to buy because of an ad."
4018,1,"I have not been using fabric softener for the past few years, opting for dryer balls instead. I was never able to find dryer sheets that did not stink. I thought I'd try again, give the rave reviews. I still haven't found any. These are terrible and stinky. Maybe if they could figure out a way to seal the box, only exposing one sheet at a time the smell might not be so overwhelming. As it is, it is. I set the box in my foyer to take to the laundry room. I returned an hour later and the whole place stunk like cheap perfume If you are at all sensitive to chemical smells and such, don't buy these."
4019,1,"The scent of these is simply far, far too strong. It became the dominant smell in any room that the unopened box was placed, even from across the room. Now the entire bedroom smells of cheap fragrant chemicals, and we had to put the box inside a sealed Ziploc bag and throw it away.The only reason I wanted them was to make clothes smell nice. Instead, they made the entire house smell terrible. Besides this, fabric softening dryer sheets are known to have no benefits and sometimes drawbacks, including skin irritation and making clothes harder to wash/dry. These are Not Worth Buying For Any Reason."
4020,1,"It seems crazy to post a review of toilet paper, but that's what I'm doing because every time I get a roll of this t.p. out of the package I get annoyed at the RIDICULOUS size of each roll. It's beyond huge. . .it's out of proportion. The width hasn't changed (or maybe it's gotten narrower?), but the radius is SO HUGE that not only does it not fit on the toiler paper dispenser at doesn't fit in the toilet paper wire rack that is attached to the side of the toilet. So unless I want a stack of toilet paper on the bathroom floor, I can only keep one roll around at a time.The ""supreme"" size is NOT a benefit, it's a pain -- because I have to keep it on the floor until I've used half of it so it can finally fit into a normal toilet paper roll dispenser on the wall. Not only would I NOT recommend this ""supreme"" version, I would have returned it if I hadn't already thrown out the gigantic box it came in before I found out about the dimensions of each roll.So, unless you prefer to keep your toilet paper on the floor, I'd skip this ""supreme"" roll and find a normal size roll of toilet paper to purchase.And a note to the Quilted Northern company -- what were you thinking? Did anyone at your company actually try to put this roll into a bathroom in a regular household? It's time to fire the person who thought up this stupid idea for oversize toilet paper rolls."
4021,1,"I never thought I would be writing a review for toilet paper but if it saves someone some money and a lot of hassle I'm all for it! I'll start by saying I usually would buy this from my local Sam's Club, but since I have twin infants it's sometimes difficult to visit stores and buy big items so I do many items using Subscribe and Save. I would typically purchase the store brand toilet paper which is good quality and a good value and I thought Quilted Northern would be a similar substitute...boy was I wrong!! The sheets are super thin, which means you use a lot more! I have also not had a clogged toilet since moving into our home over 5 years ago, but when we used this toilet paper we had at least one clog a week! I am usually skeptical when I ser ads saying it's thicket so you use less, it seemed like a ploy to justify more expensive toilet paper, but it is the truth! I changed my subscription to Cotonelle and I could not be happier, the case has lasted much longer and no clogs to report! Save yourself money in the long run and get a better quality paper."
4022,2,"We have used the quilted northern for years and have a subscribe and save order for it that we are changing to another product.The rolls are too large, so we ordered the free extenders,but they do not make these as convenient to use as a normal size roll. The extenders cause the roll to be pushed outside the recessed niche and as a result they do not roll as they should. It requires 2 hands to unroll tissues. What we have done is to use the extender adapter until the roll is reduced in size and then to remount the smaller roll onto the normal roller. We are very dissatisfied with this new product presentation and will no longer buy it. We are happy to be on our LAST package. I also agree with others who say they don't believe you get as much for your money as was the case with the previous packaging.PS: Lou from Georgia Pacific, please don't comment!"
4023,2,"We had set up a subscription for this and used it for about 2 years. Then two weeks ago our sewer plugged up. When we opened the lid to the septic tank there was a 4” thick cap of toilet paper. We had to call a sewer guy to come out and when he put his snake down the main line to the tank and pulled it out we found full sheets of toilet paper on it. He said you use northern toilet paper don’t you? Yes, he said stop, it’s the worst.We had to dig up the clean out in the yard because the baffle was packed with over 12” of toilet paper. (See before and after pics)Toilet paper should dissolve within 30 minutes after getting wet. This toilet paper never dissolves. Test it yourself by putting it in a cup of water for 30 minutes and stir it with a straw. It will come out as a full sheet. The $200+ bill for cleaning the sewer line quickly erased the savings."
4024,3,"I prefer the double roll because these are a bit too large for the dispenser. Also for some reason the large roll also doesn't seem like triple ply when compared to the double roll. Maybe they flatten it out more to put that much on the roll but whatever it is it seems closer to the double ply. One last thing, this is about 90% of the paper of the old double roll 48 pack at the same price so when it was changed it allows them to reduce their shipping costs, lower their manufacturing costs and lower what quantity they give us all at the same price as the 48 count double roll. Sounds like a win for them.Follow Up 100116: I decided to weight the rolls for comparison. The center cardboard core of this weighs 5 grams. A double roll from a 6 equals 12 pack weighs 117 grams less the 5 gram core we get 112 grams of paper on those rolls. Then I took a Supreme roll from a 8 equals 30 pack. It weighs 159 grams less the 5 gram core we get 154 grams of paper on those rolls. Based on what the packaging says the expected weight was 210 grams after the core is deducted. It's official these are garbage, not ultra plush anymore, cost more for what I believe is about 27% less over all paper from what I quickly estimated, meaning we'll use more of it because there is less paper per sheet and we just paid more for it than the past ultra plush version. Complete BS if you ask me. Of course what do you expect from a company that cares about it's bottom line and not yours....."
4025,1,"The tissues themselves are fine, but as some other reviewers have said, the plastic opening to the top of the box is not strong or well-constructed enough. Midway through the use of the tissues, the plastic weakens or rips, causing the tissue that is supposed to be peeking out of the top of the box to fall back in all the way to the stack. You have to put your hand into the box to fish out a tissue, which is not only irritating, but it further weakens and stretches the plastic. So every time you need a tissue, you have to reach down into the box to fish one out. And sometimes you end up grabbing more than what you need, and it's so IRRITATING! Do not buy these unless you enjoy wasting time fishing around to get a tissue out of the box!"
4026,2," (170 count tissue box). The old Kleenex design (narrow center hole) meant when an occasional tissue fell back in, it was hard to get out. With this 'new' changed design (large plastic opening), we learned (around the half way usage point), for each tissue taken out, 100% of the time, the next tissue falls back inside. We now keep some of the open/in use tissue boxes upside down. Trying to remember to not turn the Kleenex box the correct way when using or putting away is different. We will no longer purchase large Kleenex boxes with a large plastic center."
4027,2,"I ordered these because the headline is ""Kleenex Ultra Soft & Strong Facial Tissues."" What I received was a case of Kleenex Ultra Soft. Is there a difference? YES! Ultra Soft are useless. For some reason my supermarket only sells Kleenex ""Trusted Care"" and ""Ultra Soft"" which are both Ultra Soft. Ultra Soft is thin, brittle, and when you pull a tissue, out comes a huge puff of fibers (that cause me to continue to sneeze). Think I'm kidding? Pull out one of these tissues through a ray of direct sunlight. I need to use more than 2 tissues when I sneeze and another two more to blow my nose. With ""Ultra Soft and Strong"" I only need one tissue. DO NOT BUY THESE!! If you get a box that only says ""Ultra Soft"" or ""Trusted Care"" return it, or throw them away. Don't believe me? You'll see. I returned these as soon as I only saw ""Ultra Soft."""
4028,2,"Buying Kleenex brand in bulk has rapidly become a rip-off. I used to order the 18 pack with 240 tissues in a box and it was affordable.The number of tissues per box has dramatically decreased but the price increased. I now practically have to take a loan out to buy in bulk.In addition, every bulk order I receive has tissue boxes squished or crushed.The colors and designs have become hideously ugly and I find I'm hiding the boxes in drawers rather than on a counter.The last order I received had poor quality tissues. They left white bits/dust all over everything everytime one was pulled from the box.I think it's time to try out another brand."
4029,3,"Defective. The last case of these I ordered on Amazon were defective. The tissues were not separated enough, so wouldn't tear apart. I'd try to pull one and the entire box would go flying off the table and like 5 tissues would come out. Really poorly made. Not the first time I've ordered a name brand product on Amazon and it was inferior to the same product bought in a store (Q-tips and Shick razors were the other issues)."
4030,3,"Out of all the trash bags I've used in the home the ""Force Flex"" are the only ones that ever ripped and cause garbage to leak. Repeatedly. I mean, I understand a blowout would eventually happen but not multiple times and certainly not with something called ""Force Flex."" Just go ahead and throw these garbage bags in the garbage, but make sure that garbage bag you use to throw these garbage bags away in aren't the ""Force Flex"" bags otherwise they'll just slip out the bottom and never leave your home. The'll just leave a train of themselves across the floor."
4031,3,Man this sucks now there changing the bag went upbonvprice keep going up on price as long as webpaybit buy it we will get shafted ok I been buying theses bags for years ok whennit was 13 -14-15-16-17 now but I paid it why cause I thought it would be same it’s not home opening is smaller bag is two inches shorter from top and two inches lest wideth try to get it over your rim of garbage can now like before or double bag you can’t evennopen mouth whide enough to set in old garbage in it and box is smaller not as heavy you can tell right away as you take it out Amazons box count your bags it’s not 100.
4032,2,"I've been using the Glad drawstring bags ever since they started making drawstring bags... what was this? 20, maybe 30 years ago? Now, never again. Obviously some bean counter at Clorox/P&G decided it would be a good idea, or maybe just decided they would be a smartash or something and start making these bags a few inches shorter than they used to be. So now, the trash can which used to ""Glad""ly accept the Glad tall kitchen drawstring bags, and then the Glad tall kitchen drawstring with Febreze / odorshield bags when they started making them, no longer likes these bags. I used to never have a problem with them sliding down within the trash can; the bottoms of the bags were just the right distance from the tops of the bags, but these newer ones are way too short. The first heavy item (think an empty pickle jar or soup can) which is placed into the bag is suspended a few inches above the bottom of the can until some more weighty stuff is placed on top. So, Glad Products Company evidently thinks the trashcan should ""squash down"" to compensate for their lack of engineering prowess. Of course, we all know that what will happen instead is that the bag will be pulled from around the rim of the trash can, and then disappear into the abyss, folding up and wadding up in the bottom of the trashcan. Combine this with the fact that I live in the home with two teenagers, and what we have is WAY too dang much trouble than one man should EVER have to deal with in something as banal as a fraggin' TRASH BAG!Oh, and just so the bean counters know... due to this, we will also be switching to some other brand of sandwich and freezer bags, as well as cling wrap.Fool me once, shame on you...."
4033,2,"This is how many bags (10) that it took to find one with a solid bottom. This was after I had to pick up all my trash because the bottom split on my half full bag. The last 3 bags had leaked, and I assumed my kids were just being lazy and spilling drinks. I can't find a working email address, and I'm not sitting on the phone and taking up any more of my time. Have had these on subscribe and save for a while and I'll be canceling that today, because of the difficulty in accessing customer service. Disappointed.."
4034,2,"Although these bags start out barely able to wrap around the top lip of my commonly available Sterilite 13-gal kitchen trash can, as soon as I drop anything in what weighs enough to pull the bottom of the bag to the bottom of the trash can (or push something in to make use of the full capacity of the trash can), they drop off the top lip of the trash can and begin to disappear into the trash. It's as if they are 11.5-gal bags, not designed to hold the contents of a 13-gal trash can so that the customer has to use up the box of bags faster. No, really? Could this be another scheme to market more product by selling undersized products? (Does anyone remember the 1/2-gallon containers of ice cream that magically shrunk to 1.5-quart containers of aerated product hardly qualified to be labeled ""ice cream?"") The Hefty bags I had been using never let me down this way. I regret switching to Glad bags. I'm switching back to Hefty as soon as I use of this box of Glad bags while getting what use out of them their manufacturer allows."
4035,2,"I have used these sponges for over 10 years and recently purchased the ""too good to be true"" 18-pack for less than $1 a sponge. I just noticed today that the sponges are leaking blue dye. I tried 3 different, new sponges from the package and all of them leaked blue dye. My sink is white and I have new dishes that are white, so the blue color is much more noticeable than if I had a stainless steel sink.I researched the issue online and have found dozens of people who have experienced the same thing with all different colors of sponges. I also saw multiple responses from Scotch Brite representatives that stated the dyes are not harmful. Companies like using that phrase, ""not harmful."" Is that really what a worried consumer wants to hear from a billion dollar corporation? Didn't tobacco companies use that phrase?If you have these sponges, you should test them out by applying dish soap, wetting the sponge and then squeezing out the suds into the sink. If you have a stainless steel sink, squeeze out the suds onto a white dish or bowl so it's easier to see the contrast in color.This is my first experience with the blue dye, but it is enough to get me to find an alternative. It's becoming more frequent that I have to find alternatives to the ""major brands."" Their materials are getting cheaper and their concern for consumer safety is following suit."
4036,2,"I too have been using the blue Scotch Brite sponges for years, buying them in an eighteen-pack at a well-known big box store. They were a dependable product, lasting about two weeks per sponge on average, holding up well for our family of two, so not heavy use. 3M has recently changed the sponge, and for the worse. I still have several of the original sponges, as well as some of the newer sponges I purchased in Oct/Nov of 2017. I am comparing the two, still in their clear wrap, as I write.Objectively, the new sponge is roughly 20% thinner than the original and the sponge is a little deeper blue in color. I have not experienced any blue leaching that some reviewers have noted. What I have also experienced is that the new sponges do not hold up nearly as well: They lose their structural firmness, or integrity, after 4-5 uses, again for a two member family. They no longer spring back as you would expect a sponge to do, easily crushing flat, with a consistency closer to a dish cloth at this point, and not holding nearly as much water/soap, requiring more frequent refreshing of same. Before much time passes, a couple days, the sponges begin to breaking apart. Speaking generously, the new sponge lasts at best a week, or half as long as the original, and the use of the product is not pleasant to use. What especially annoys me is the package that states, ""Lasts 50% Longer."" What chutzpah!To be fair, the company did increase the package count from 18 to 21. This does not really improve the mathematics for good value. WhenI bought the old sponges, lasting two weeks, I could expect to buy more after 36 weeks or so. Now even with 21 new-style sponges, needing to replace one after only one week, I am obligated to obtain another package after 21 weeks. Fairly obvious I need to replace much sooner and have to spend more cash over time to keep myself stocked. A much worse deal for this consumer. I think 3M saved money on the actual production of the newer, and in my opinion inferior sponges, while the buyer also has to shell out more to the company, since they don't last.I will no longer buy them. In our current climate, sadly, it seems so much easier to take advantage of the little guy."
4037,2,"I've been buying these Scotch-Brite sponges from Amazon.com for years. Something has definitely changed in the quality of these sponges in my two recent orders. In a prior order, the sponges were wet when I took them out of their packaging and when placed in the dish water in the sink, there was blue dye that came out of them with a funky smell. The order I recently received, the texture of the sponges was totally different from the usual Scotch-Brite brand. The sponges are much thinner also. I'm very leery of buying any more of this type of sponge through Amazon in the future as it seems these are knock-off sponges. I don't like them at all."
4038,2,"I have used these sponges for over 10 years and recently purchased the ""too good to be true"" 18-pack for less than $1 a sponge. I just noticed today that the sponges are leaking blue dye.

4039,1,"I thought these Scotch-Brite sponges would be a safe purchase because I frequently buy the same brand from the grocery store. But these sponges were totally different from the ones at the store. They were much more poorly made. They bled copious amounts of blue dye, not just on first use, but throughout their lifetime. That can't be healthy. They also showed wear more quickly than the grocery store variety. I still don't know what happened: the vendor looks legit, but the sponges feel like Chinese knock-offs. I'd recommend against them."
4040,1,"It seems to be impossible these days to find a god d*** trash bag that fits in the effings bin!By ""Tall"" kitchen bags they REALLY mean ""SHORT AND WIDE"". You might be asking yourself ""How would that be considered tall then?"" and to that I say ""IT ISN'T TALL AT ALL!""Sorry, I am pissed off because I specifically bought these for a regular shaped 11 gallon can, and these are not only 13 gallon (yeah right...) but said they were tall. How is it that a ""Tall 13 gallon"" bag can't even fill a regular shaped 11 gallon can?Because these are crap.If your can is 5 gallons, these 13 gallons MIGHT work. Otherwise they will hover a foot above the bottom of the can and as soon as you toss one thing in there the bag will fall into the can which drives me insane."
4041,3,"We got these to test out and hopefully find a lower price-point trash bag. I mean they're trash bags, right? I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for a bag I put my trash in. Unfortunately, a lower price for these means a lower quality product in my experience. The drawstring around the top stretches as you try to pull the bag out of the trash can to the point that it will rip the top of the bag. If you rip off the drawstring, you'll grab the plastic bag - and that will rip with any gentle force.I'm not putting like, wire hangers, 10 lb dumbbells and glass in my trash. Just normal everyday trash proved to be too much to handle for these guys."
4042,3,"These bags are significantly smaller than the 13 gallons that they advertise; when we held the bag up to a Kirkland bag of the same supposed volume, there were inches difference in both height and width, with the Kirkland bag being our usual and preferred bag. There is zero room for expansion, so they fill way too quickly. Finally, once filled, they are very difficult to get out of a standard plastic garbage canister. Because of the difficulty, we end up overextending the drawstrings, so we have to double-bag every time just to get the bag of garbage out to the dumpster. Without a doubt, these are the worst bags we have ever used. We bought a box of 90, and in 2 weeks we have used almost half of them. If we could give zero stars, we would."
4043,3,"I seldom write reviews, but these bags are such a poor product that I was compelled to comment.My last bags were made by Glad, and my next bags surely will be as well. These bags are super fragile, and the weld process at the top, where the pocket it formed to contain the bag tie is sloppy. 25% of the bags in my box are welded shut, at least partially, and it's impossible to open the bag without tearing holes in it.The first few bags weren't that bad, but the problem seems to be growing as I get further down in the box.I should've returned them, but I kept hoping the quality would improve. Oh well, I tried to go cheap, bad choice this time."
4044,2,"I was buying the Glad ForceFlexPlus bags, and Amazon suggested these as a similar item. They were cheaper of course (8 cents per page), so I thought I'd try them.With the Glad ForceFlexPlus, I could put about anything in them, even heavy items (like a watermelon) and then once full, I could grab the strings and pull/tie it right up. Next I would drop it off our 2nd floor balcony into the large trash can below. The Glad bags would take it all. I even put wooden skewers in the bags before, and even though a couple of the sharp points went through, the structure of the bag held together.Now regarding these ""similar"" bags... Yeah, they rip and tear if you aren't super careful. Honestly, all the 4 and 5 star reviews must be fake (unless they are storing tissue paper and cotton balls). Or maybe these bags use to great, and they were cheapened for profits. Only chance these bags have is to double bag, which then makes them more expensive than the Glad ForceFlexPlus.We'll be going back to Glad ForceFlexPlus. Well worth the extra 8 cents per bag."
4045,1,"I bought these to use for a camping trip. I wanted ones that stood up while putting food in them, that feature didn't work very well. In fact when I was at home (before leaving for our trip) I was trying to stand these up, while trying to put some cooked meat into the bags..HUGE FAIL!! The bags kept falling over...even when they had a little bit in the bottom!!! So they lost 2 stars because of that! With the meat I also put a very small amount of au jus (to keep meat moist during reheat) with it, which did spill out after being sealed...so it lost 2 more stars!!So IF you want to put drier products (without any moistness) in here, and you don't need to stand up while you're putting it in...then these are your bags!!"
4046,2,"I don't normally do ziplock bags because I don't have the patience or fine-motor skills or whatever it takes to zip the thing closed. However, I saw that these ones came with an actual zipper, so I had high hopes I could do it. I opened one box, pulled out a baggie, stuffed some stuff in it, opened and closed it several times with the built-in zipper, and it worked great! Twelve times. On the 13th closing, the ""zipper"" flew off the bag. Being the pragmatic person that I am, I wanted to put it back on and try it again, but it was nowhere to be seen. I wouldn't mind so much if I bought one box, but they came in a set of three. I now have 95 more invisible projectile zipper missiles. Needless to say, I won't be buying these again, although they won't go to waste. Fortunately for me, I have several thousand twist-ties.Edit: I'm upgrading my original review because I've found a way to use these. The opening is slightly smaller than the bag, so if you put something big in it, don't try to stuff it in. And don't rush. Open and close the zipper gently. Yes, I know we're all in a hurry but... Gently! So far, so good."
4047,2,"Counterfeit or Crap?MAYBE its just my boxes, but when the wife (who is a Ziploc-aholic) tells me to never buy these again I know its not just me. Almost every one you pull out malfunctions. They are closed when you pull them out...you slide them ""open"" and they are still closed. Slide them back - still closed. Clasp comes half way off. Just a mess. And SO FRUSTRATING when you are trying to put food into them and can't get them open. NEVER have I had issues with Ziploc before.....which makes me seriously wonder if these are knock-offs. Either way, I am staying away."
4048,2,"I never thought I’d review a bag, but here I am because I’m so annoyed with these.I have had so many issues with the zipper thing after you open and close a few times. It comes off and then it’s near impossible to get it back on and still functional. I end up getting it back on and then it slices the bag.It just seems like too much work for something that is supposed to make my life easier. I’m going back to the old school sealing style."
4049,1,"Made savory pretzels in a Ziploc slider gallon bag for my daughter's college care package. Turned the bag over periodically as instructed during 2 hour ""marinade"". After 1 hour the bag spilled all over the counter and the floor when I turned it over. I assumed it was because I didn't have the bag properly closed...stupid me. Made a new batch, this time MAKING SURE the bag was properly closed EACH TIME I TURNED IT OVER. Same thing happened again...turned the bag over and aaargh ...contents all over the counter and the floor. So clearly a problem with the design. Next time I go back to just normal store-brand gallon bags. Clearly a problem with Zip-loc's design---BEWARE!!"
4050,3,I bought a Swiffer Wetjet sweeper and to say I've been disappointed is putting it mildly. I bought a case of the wetjet refills and they are more of a mess than help. I clean wood and tile floors and the pads aren't attaching like I thought they would and I've gone out to YouTube to see if I'm doing something wrong. Turns out I'm not alone. If I had it to do all over again I wouldn't have invested what I did in the Swiffer System. I bought replacement spray bottles that were twice the size that I got initially. The dry pads don't have the Velcro strip that the initial ones had and I give up trying to put the pads on the head only for them to come off and not work very well at all.
4051,1,"So I try and give all products a fair shake. The item is really basic. Nothing of intuitive design went into this. The velcro seam that runs down the center of the the chest area and the edges are really sharp causing damage to the area the edges of the velcro seam are exposed to. The placement as a touched on earlier is not in a good spot. Most dogs have a more exposed under belly, on this item all of the roughest parts of the product are on the under belly. No design effort was made to protect the under side of a dog while wearing. Its very rough. I would recommend NOT buying."
4052,2,"I have been using this item for years. The pads in my most recent order are thinner and less fluffy than the product always been. It is the loft of the fabric that allows dirt, dust and debris to be trapped. These have less loft and, not surprisingly, perform less effectively. The pads are closer to those of store brands and other lower-cost items.I contacted P&G customer relations, describing the decline in product quality. Their response was to inform me that there is no indication of change in manufacturing methods, nor plans to change the product. In no way did they seem concerned that there might be a defect in production. I was also informed that there is now available an extra thick version of the product that I might be interested in.Pardon my cynicism, but it seems odd that after introducing an extra thick version of the standard product that the standard product apparently is now being made thinner and less effective than what had been the perfectly adequate original! Shame on you, P&G."
4053,3,"I don't like anything about it. What I actually ordered, by mistake, was Swiffer Dry Clothes. What I needed to order was Swiffers Dusters Unscented. I don't have the info before me but according to your info they are still available. They are NOT ""dusting clothes."" I think I could have ordered refills, which would have been fine, since I actually still have the plastic holder that these refills fit on: It is plastic, about 18"" long, yellow handle and a pronged white holder on which the Swiffers fit. Now, when it's too late, you have shown me the exact items that I want! I'm not at all sure I want to go to the trouble to return these useless Swiffers clothes, but at least I can make a fuss!I can't do anything with the ""Headline"" below: If you mean for me to tell you, I got the wrong item. Is it too late now?"
4054,3,"I love swiffer and have many of their products. I like the idea they have, because my apt is always dusty and our allergies are always at an uproar, but I thought I was getting a much thicker form of duster cloth. I dust daily with them throughout the my small 2 bd apt (living room, small dining room and kitchen) have that hardwood look, but isn't and I have to change the pads at least twice before I can even finish one floor in one room. I'm keeping them because it's cheaper to keep'em than to send them back."
4055,3,"I'd been saving this new mop for a while, looking forward to using it when my old mop finally gave up the ghost.What a let-down it turned out to be.Used it for the first time this morning to mop three small rooms. It broke at one of the telescoping joints before I was even finished. Wasn't doing anything crazy strenuous with it, just applying medium pressure to clean the floors.Before it broke, I liked it. The spinning bucket works well, the triangular shaped head helps get into corners and tight spaces, and the microfiber picked up stuff nicely. But none of that matters if the thing falls apart on the first use.Boo, O-Cedar! For the price, I expected better."
4056,1,"I have been using this for some months now and i have to say i am not at all impressed . First thing that happened is the red plastic rim/splash guard that surrounds the spinning basket keeps falling off. Just a slight touch with the mop head can dislodge it and it will either fall in the bucket or onto the floor. Second issue i encountered is when the bucket is full ( to just below the spinning basket level) when one lifts it up to empty it the bucket tips off center and tends to spill liquid back onto the floor. Sort of defeats the object ? Lastly you have to be extremely gentle with the foot spin mechanism, too much pressure and it makes a load noise and slips not spinning the basket at all. You sort of have to baby it to make it spin successfully. Certainly not a product i could recommend to anyone!"
4057,1,"4.5 stars. Nearly five thousand reviews. 30 bucks. Might as well give it a shot right? Yeah, this thing reminds me of one those toy janitor sets. It's just so small and cheap. Judging by the pictures, it looks like the mop handle is supposed to have 3 segments to extend. I was only able to extend 2. I thought about taking channel locks to the thing in order get that supposed third segment unstuck, but I figured I was going to return any way; thus, I didn't want to damage it.Regardless, the mop head is laughably small. It has about a third of the material that you'd find on the typical household mop. Once again, I was planning on returning it, so I did not test how well the head actually cleaned; however, I remain rather skeptical.Oh, and I'm not an expert on such things, but I suspect that the picture of the lady using the product either featured a really tiny girl, or a bit of photoshop, in order to make the product look bigger. The size difference may not be as egregious, but it reminds me of those pictures of kiddy pools you sometimes see floating around social media. You know, the one's where the box art makes the product look huge, but it's actually really tiny.Taking a closer look at the reviews, other people seem to be complaining about the mop wringer breaking as well. All the gears for that look solid enough; so I don't know if the plastic is rather brittle, or if they thickened it up with a later revision. Regardless, plastic mechanical parts typically aren't known for having long mean times between failures, and people are reporting that it is a point of failure. So, consider it another reason to shy away from the product -especially since I could find no information about a warranty on Amazon nor O-Cedar's website.And finally, after being surprised at how dinky the thing was, I decided to take a look at what people had actually written, and saw a review with someone mentioning ""Fakespot"", which is a site meant to identify fake reviews. Well hell, I've got to check this out. Looks, like old Fakespot says that the aggregate reviews have an ""A"" grade, but it also indicates that Amazon removed about 2,000 reviews on two separate occasions. Now, I don't know why Amazon decided to purge nearly 4k reviews, but all of this stuff makes me strongly suspect a fair bit of review astroturfing.Needless to say, I will be returning this dinky piece of garbage. Moreover, the thing makes me think that the O-Cedar business model is all about selling garbage to consumers, and hoping that a minimal amount will be bothered to return it. Stay away from the mop. Stay away from the O-Cedar brand."
4058,2,When I tried to use this item I found that the handle was broken inside and was in 3 pieces. The step on handle that works the spinner was also broken. Didn't find this out until I had the bucket filled and the wet mop head in the spinner. When I tried to return it as parts missing/broken I got a message saying that it was ineligible for a return. I am out almost $30 on a product I can't use because it is broken beyond the ability to use it at all. I guess if I got down on my hands and knees and just used the mop head and wrung it out by hand using their bucket I could use it. Very much defeats the purpose that I bought it for though. I would not order this again.
4059,1,"I purchased this product based on what seemed like majority positive reviews and this being an ""Amazon's Choice"" product. It did not live up to expectations.The mop head as pictured is much more substantial than the one actually received (I even made the mistake of ordering additional heads with my bundled purchase). The mop head received was dinky. Fair for light household use in smaller spaces, but not effective for larger or tougher cleaning jobs. It also feels like it is sized for use by a child, not an adult.I also found it difficult to adequately spin the mop head; no matter how much I spun it (think ""salad spinner for a mop""), the head was still really, really wet, to sopping...not good for wood floors!I also washed the mop head after first use. It came out looking nothing like it had been ""refreshed"" or new again. But it did hold up to a machine washing, which I was sort of skeptical about (since the strings don't really feel very microfiber cloth-like, but more like super heavy duty paper).Ultimately, it seems like it's most useful for light jobs, or as a really pricey floor/wall/ceiling duster if used dry. The bucket itself is a manageable size for carrying, so I will probably use for other purposes. And the spinner feature--if it holds up--might be okay for ""wringing"" out hand cloths...?I would suggest a different product for your mopping needs. As much as I am grossed out by conventional string mops and buckets with wringers, they get the job done much better than this!"
4060,1,"This product is extremely deceiving in its marketing and presentation. This product claims to 100% biodegradable and flushable. One would assume that would mean that this product would dissolve like regular toilet paper right? Wrong. What DUDE Wipes fails to show on this page actively hides from the product pictures is the big asterisk under the words ""100% Biodegradable Flushable"". Because of this I decided to provide a picture of it myself. Also, because I myself, have septic system, I decided to run my own experiment. I submerged a single DUDE Wipe in a bowl of water and left it there for several day, simulating a septic system. Did this wipe ""biodegrade""? Nope. So lets assume that these wipes will slowly degrade over several years; that still does NOT solve any of the problems that are cause by flushable wet wipes i.e. sewer burgs. While it may be truthful in a purely legal stand point, you cannot deny the deceptive marketing of this product. DUDE Wipes claims to ""be saving the world"" but in all actually is just a company using environmentalism as a marketing ploy."
4061,1,"Do not buy these. They tear when used, they come out in clumps, and they are just a poor product.I tried ""Dude Wipes"" after years of using another wipe (Swipes Lovin Wipes). I wanted something with packaging that looked more masculine in my bathroom. These Dude Wipes look more masculine, but they work about as well as wet toilet-paper.If you're looking for a good wipe, Amazon is listing the Swipes Lovin Wipes at about the same cost as these, and they work a MILLION times better."
4062,2,"My first experience with this product was back in 2015. Overall I thought the product was great. When my pack ran out I never did reorder. Fast forward 1.5-2 years. Even with some of the negative reviews regarding packaging and dispensing I decided to purchase again. I did not experience any of those issues with my first purchase. After receiving the product I now know exactly why the product is being rated so low. The lid is useless and half the time doesn’t even close. The original package lid snapped at least keeping it more air tight which leads to the wipes not drying out as fast. With the new package, you cannot pull a single wipe out. This leads to pulling out a bunch of ~5 wipes and ripping them to pieces in the process. I have no idea how Dude employees are commenting on the reviews and saying they improved the packaging. Having used both “packages”, the current package is useless. I will not buy this product again."
4063,2,"They seem really cheaply made. Not only is my toilet paper more durable (these constantly rip either during use of just trying to get them out of the packaging), they leave behind fuzzies and tug on my hairs while TP doesn't.They leave a residue in the area that's not super enjoyable.I also bought the shower wipes and I'm scared to try them.I will be trying other brands, but I'm sorry to say that baby wipes seem to be a cheaper AND MORE DURABLE option."
4064,3,"Don't like that each towelette is layered on top of each other so that once you pull one off, the 2nd towel will pop out of the dispenser. In reading the response to another similar complaint where the manufacturer tells the consumer to buy their ""trial sized"" version, instead of taking that feedback and saying, ""Let me discuss this with a production engineer"", they refer the consumer to another size of their product. If that's the case, why not just tell the consumer, ""Go to our competitors because I don't think your complaint is valid"". The complaint IS valid and I'm perfectly fine with going to another brand. These aren't kleenex, they're PRE-MOISTENED wipes, they're meant to be kept sealed, so having more than one come out IS a flaw. Fix it and I may consider coming back.I was initially going with 2 stars, but going with 1 star since feedback to try and help improve the product apparently falls on deaf ears."
4065,3,"*** updated review ***These are worse than I thought. I used them to wash the car today. These microfibers are among some of the worst that I have ever used (I've been buying microfibers for about 10 years). When using soap, these barely lather up at all, because they are so skimpy (they apparently have fewer fibers than higher-quality microfibers. They also do a poor job of buffing. Horrible, horrible quality. Not worth the purchase at all.Original review:I'm almost always happy with AmazonBasics products, but these are the exception. They are relatively small and fairly thin. In particular, check out costco before buying these! The ones at my local costco are much, much better."
4066,3,Very disappointed as this makes 2 out of 2 amazon basics purchases which have been terrible quality for prices that aren't that great. These cloths have almost none of that microfiber gripping when you brush it across your fingers. I have some left over unused Zwipes brand microfibers from amazon that blow these away for microfiber grip. These weigh in at 30g each on my postal scale while the Zwipes are 33g and you can feel it in thickness. The Zwipes are also 80% cotton instead of these which are 90% cotton and its well known across the internet that 80% is the sweet spot for a quality microfiber. I don't understand all the positive reviews on here for these cloths when there is a superior product at the same price available on amazon.
4067,1,"I’m a loyal Amazon customer but not of these towels, when I did a search on auto detail microfiber towels these came up so I bought them. Don’t buy these for auto detail, loops on these towels are short and not so soft. I will be giving them to my wife to clean around the house. Buy them at Walmart the brand is Auto Drive 14x14 only $10.00 for a pack of 30, the loops are way longer and softer, they don’t have a tag so I don’t have to rip a tag every time I use one and the best part on these towels is no edge that’s right no hard edges for a swirl free waxing or polishing. So Amazon can you please remove these towels under the auto detail search and on the description write not for auto detailing, thank you."
4068,3,"These have no substance, way too thin for me. Clearly many out there like them, more power to you. But if you are used to a thick microfiber towel these aren't for you. If you like a very thin microfiber towel, that curls up on the corners after being washed, then these will be perfect for you! I love amazon, have many things amazon in my home from Echo (Alexa) to Kindle Fire, Amazon Basics shredder (Awesome) but these were a disappointment for ME. My first thought for these was the garbage can, would have been easier but I decided to donate the whole package of cloths to the ""Good Will"" instead. I have a suggestion, please make a thick microfiber towel for those of us that don't like super thin microfiber towels."
4069,2,At first they seemed great but after a week of light use for wiping down glass to get smudges off little strings started coming off. When I say light I mean once or twice a week on a small piece of glass.Most clothes like this have never done that too me until I washed them but these started letting off so many strands the glass would come back worse looking then I wipe it down with other clothes I have and it's clean looking again.Horrendous quality. Won't buy again. This is sad because usually I am satisfied with Amazon basics quality.
4070,2,"Pros: NothingCons: doesn’t work, it’s more difficult and time consuming to use than a sponge, it sprays cleaner everywhere (make sure to wear safety glasses if you buy decide to buy it), if you have arthritis, carpal tunnel, or De Quervains you will be in pain afterward.I ordered this to deep clean our main shower. I used the large brush over 3/4 of the shower with two difference cleaners and asked my husband to come in to see if he could tell where I cleaned.He literally chose the only corner that I had not cleaned as looking the cleanest.I scrubbed this shower for more than an hour. I presoaked it with my regular cleaner before taking the drill brush to it. I tried different speeds and pressures to see if there was any way to make this brush work.Nope.I gave up and scrubbed shower walls with a 10cent sponge. The sponge did a better job."
4071,3," It is so out of balance it is hard to hold on to. A very good example of everything out of China, and I was going to fix this myself but at some point the manufacturers have to be held accountable for the zero quality control they they give us. Amazon and China have made the numbers in sales high enough for the both of them to take the returns for poor quality acceptable to the bottom line. In other words the manufacturers have no incentive to make quality products, they simply do not have to so why would they. The Soviets's for years were the best example of why the free market works, my favorite Russian proverb was, ""As long as you pretend to pay me, I will pretend to work."" This does not apply to China's manufacturing, we tend to view China as a Free Trade entity, it is not. It is totally government controlled. They even have entire Cities built to perfectly mimic middle america so the American buyers and manufacturers can feel at home and comfortable. That is not Free Trade, that is no different than a military special ops program in a war. And all of this for a seemingly innocent little scrub brush. Look at a market of one billion or more customers world wide, with manufacturers that have no environmental, no workers unions, nothing even close to the restrictions that our companies have to live by. This seemingly innocent brush is a bullet in a war between countries. All we can do is keep sending them back and hope the next purchase will work as stated."
4072,3,"I got the heavy duty version because my pool tiles at the water line were pretty dirty. I was able to clean them by hand with the pool brush but it was very slow, time consuming and labor intensive. These had great reviews so I was super excited to get them cleaned up fast without so much effort. I ripped open the box the second it arrived, attached to my 20v Dewalt, grabbed some cleaner and...NOTHING! I tried all 3 brushes and each was just as terrible as the other. The grout got clean pretty quick but the tiles didn’t almost at all. It was a huge disappointment. I had such high hopes. I don’t really have another use for these now so I feel like it was a waste of my money. How do these have such good reviews? Are people just cleaning up simple stains? My pool brush with just me operating it by hand and no pole works WAY better than a drill operated brush! How is that? There must be a stronger model than this that’s actually “heavy duty”! These are just a giant let down..."
4073,2,"Bought this product after reading positive reviews so I wanted to share my thoughts to help the next person pondering a purchase. Strike 1- a drill is heavy to hold so this product is not easy to use. Strike 2- after holding the product in one spot for several rotations, the shower wall is not clean. Strike 3- I only used this product for 15 minutes before I gave up and the top was already smashed down so really no need to try to use it again. I ended up getting my old scrub brush out and cleaned the shower stall. Wish I had read a review like this before I wasted my time and money."
4074,3,Not what I expected. Not as easy to use as videos demonstrating product use. It is awkward to use versus conventional tools and brushes. The brushes are attached to a drill which is normally meant to be stationary for drilling holes or screwing screws. You don’t normally move a drill while using. This brush system requires you to make unnatural movements with a drill while applying pressure for scrubbing. I don’t think drills are designed to be used in this manner. It places weird stress on your wrist hand being used to activate the drill power button. I used the brushes once and would rather scrub with a regular brush than this brush system. I could not find a comfortable way to use the system that did not put twisting stress on my wrist hand pushing the drill power button.
4075,1,"TERRIBLE! Amazon needs to update the star rating system so you can give zero stars, which would equate to the life I got out of the first 8 batteries I used! Needed these batteries for these little finger monkeys that my kids love. Changed out the original batteries that each initially came with (4 in each), and all 8 were dead within two days! Ran them all through my battery tester and all were dead! Replaced with a different brand from the store and they are now working fine. Won’t even bother with the rest of the batteries that came with this order, and neither should you!"
4076,2,Batteries were low voltage on arrival on my tester (1.2 volts should be 1.55 volts when fresh). They may run your device but they do not have a full life in them. Manufacture is at best dumping old batteries or at worst manufacturing a defective or low grade product. No expiration date or manufacture date on the package. No country of origin listed. Buy a tester on amazon if you do not have one. It is the only way that the consumer can keep these battery manufactures honest. They are not fresh and I returned them immediately.
4077,3,"This Amazon listing appears to be confusing (at least) or outright deceptive (at worst). The description lower in the Amazon listing says ""Safer and Greener Li-ion Batteries"", and the brand name ""LiCB"" seems to imply that these are Lithium Ion batteries (since the brand name uses ""Li"", which is the chemical symbol for Lithium). HOWEVER, Battery parameters (graphic at top, next-to-left, of listing) show: Chemical System: Alkaline"". So these are really only alkaline batteries and NOT lithium ion batteries after all?"
4078,3,"Great price, great shipping. As far as the batteries go, they are a low quality battery. Out of 10 batteries only 1 checked out ok. 4 batteries were only 3/4 charge , but still ok . 3 batteries were at 1/2 charge and died under drain at 30 seconds . 2 batteries were DOA.Now to go back to my first thoughts, I guess it's not a good price.I did start the process for a return but no way I was paying shipping cost for the return , and that seemed like that was the way it was heading so I just stopped the process. You know how it is "" sometimes you eat the bear and sometimes the bear eats you "" ."
4079,3,"I usually take negative reviews here with a grain of salt, and MOST of the reviews for these batteries were actually good. But buyer beware. Tried to put them in my daughter's singing toy and it sounded like it was dying right away. The entire lot of batteries measured ~0.47V for me. The dead batteries they replaced measure 0.3V. They are supposed to be 1.55V new. Thank goodness for Amazon customer support helping make this right immediately, but stay away from these batteries. I'm sure others have gotten good ones, but it's just not worth the hassle. What to get instead? I don't know, still trying to figure that out because most batteries on here seem to have similar problems in the reviews, but it's an arm and a leg to buy them at your local store. Still, definitely not worth the cost on these, they were worthless for what I wanted to do."
4080,1,"This product does not smell good when adding to wash, and I cannot say that it actually sanitizes. What I will say that the smell intensifies after washing. Running the same load of laundry through the washing machine twice more, the smell was better or so I thought.Once I dried the laundry, the smell is so bad that I gag and find the clean clothing (having been through 3 complete washing cycles), unwearable. I am going to have to try to figure out how to remove the smell.I would not recommend this product and if you do go ahead.....run a test wash on old or unimportant items."
4081,1,"Update: My original rating was 5 stars, but I have to change that to 1 star. The reason for this is because I just read the back of the bottle carefully, and this is why I made the change...*This is partly what it says:WHEN YOU WASH YOUR CLOTHES IN COLD WATER, BACTERIA CAN SURVIVE***KILLS 99.9% OF BACTERIA (Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae)What it also says, which isn't indicated on the front, or for that matter on TV commercials or this Amazon page (meaning that before purchasing, we have no idea this is part of the process):TO SANITIZE: ADD TO RINSE CYCLE AND LEAVE PRODUCT IN RINSE CYCLE FOR 16 MINUTES.*So basically, we're paying money for a product that claims it sanitizes and kills germs, but doesn't tell you that you'll have to monitor and adjust the rinse cycle of your washing machine. As many others, I have to use coin operated machines and can't keep the rinse cycle going for that amount of time. Because of that, I feel as though I've only been using blue colored water for all this time.Although Lysol isn't false advertising, they are not providing us with this important information about this product. Most people may not realize that they need to go through this process (or want to, for that matter), but are expecting they've killed all of the germs in their laundry (well actually...unknowingly they may have...if they used hot water... thus eliminating the need to use this product entirely). I mean, I was that person for quite awhile. It makes me angry that another big corporation took me for a ride, and I've paid out alot of my money. I'm also disappointed that I thought my clothes were germ-free, and they were not, because there were many times I didn't use hot water.*******I'd highly discourage others from buying this*******My original review:This is a great product to have and use when doing laundry. If you have a need to rid your clothes and any washable item of germs, and they cannot be bleached, this is a really good alternative. It has a nice clean scent which isn't overpowering at all.For instance, if you've got smelly and sweaty clothes, pets in your home, etc., this is quite invaluable. I actually use mine because I have to wash my clothing in my apartment building's laundry facilities. They honestly aren't super clean and this assures me that I'm not picking up yuck from someone else's stuff (mostly when the person before me overloads the washer). To add to the importance of it, I've got an autoimmune disorder and this double assures me of the germ reducing effect (if you're not able to see yet, I'm a bit of a germaphobe lol)."
4082,3,"After using this my husband broke out in a rash that required dr visits and prescription medication to clear up. After speaking with friends learned that the same thing happened with their children. Also, the directions are very specific to ensure product effectiveness and I do not have the time to watch my washer or time the length of rinse cycle so I can’t be sure this even worked to sanitize laundry. Others claim the smell and softness are improved but neither of those show sanitized and the smell is because of the overwhelming chemicals added to fragrance the laundry, not cleanliness."
4083,2,"WARNING!!! Cuases Severe Allegiance reactions!I bought this product from walmart. I only used 1 cap full in my high efficient washer. (Instruction said to use 2 cap fulls). My fiancé now has been having hives and itching on 90% of his body. We call poison control on the back of the bottle and they told us to stop using. The back label of the bottle is not informative and is very hard to peel the label back to reveal the true warnings of this product. The first line is ""hazard to humans and domestic animals"" why wold they even market this product? I am infuriated. If I had known that the hard to peel label stated that I would have never purchased this product."
4084,2,"""Leave in rinse cycle for 16 minutes."" There is no way for me to know how long my rinse cycle is on my HE machine and although it says add to the softener cycle--it says add 2 cupfuls which is more than my softener dispenser can hold. So since I can't get enough in the machine---and I'm not sure that it makes sense in the softener dispenser....and it takes 16 minutes to sanitize laundry--I highly doubt this is doing anything to my laundry. I've asked lysol company questions about this and they run me in circles without giving me direct answers so I won't be purchasing again."
4085,2,"I've been buying these napkins for years. Used to be really good quality and very soft to the touch. It was the only brand I bought. But they've gone cheap and while they look the same, they feel rougher, even a little sand-paper like when touching it to your face. I'm hoping this is just a bad batch, but I'm guessing they've compromised on quality to save money. I'll buy them one more time and if there's no improvement, then I'll have to switch brands. I didn't buy these from Amazon, so this review is not a negative comment on the seller."
4086,3,"The napkins would've been fine if not for the fact that they appear to have been hastily shoved into the box for shipping and came to me half crushed. I'm sure it will be a pleasure to offer crumpled napkins to my dinner guests. I expected a little bit more from Amazon fulfillment.Other than that, the item was as described. These napkins are a decent thickness and more elegant than your run-of-the-mill paper napkins (suitable for a dinner party or similar event), and that's exactly what I was looking for."
4087,2,"Is Amazon where Vanity Fair dumps their products that don't pass quality inspection? Imagine how embarrassed I was to donate these to our Community Thanksgiving Dinner yesterday to find they had not been cut properly - opened like a fan - at least two napkins linked together - uncut - not even two-thickness - a total mess and disaster. Of course we had to try to use them as we had nothing to fall back on. I have purchased Vanity Fair napkins for years and have never had this happen, but all packages were the same! I will never buy their products again."
4088,2,I ordered these in bulk bc I really liked the material which was much more 'cloth-like.' The thin papery napkins from the grocery store were fine for when I had kids but once they got older I indulged in Vanity Fair's napkins. Been using these napkins for almost 20 years. I've been disappointed ever since they changed from the cloth-like material to a more papery design that is just a step above the thin paper napkins you find everywhere. For that reason I will no longer be buying Vanity Fair's napkins once I find a suitable replacement.
4089,3,Extremely thin plates that rip easily at the folded perforations. I have to use 2-4 plates when I microwave as 1 plate isn't strong enough. Some of the plates are already ripped at the folded perforations right out of the plastic package. I have to put a second plate under a ripped plate and make sure that the ripped areas are not in the same location. I didn't need to use these for a couple of months after buying them so I doubt if they will give me a refund.
4090,1,If you are looking for your Dixie quality plates... THESE ARE NOT THOSE!They do not hold anything warm. The moisture goes right thru the plate.I bought a case of these.. and they are USELESS!!!Spend the extra money and make sure you get the GOOD quality. EVERYDAY DISPOSABLE do not even hold a warm item. DO NOT even try a hot item.. it saturates the plate and leaves residue under the plate onto the table etc.
4091,3,I subscribed to these because they are slightly cheaper than similar ones at Walmart from a cheaper brand and they work decently but they can't hold much weight. Basically everything I put on it other than very lightweight items (such as bacon/scrambled eggs) causes the plates to bend and snap. I didn't expect them to handle really heavy items but I can barely use them for hamburger helper or even add grits to my plate for breakfast. They handle liquidy foods pretty well though.Not sure if I will continue my subscription because I'm only saving $1-2 I think and I definitely prefer Walmarts brand.
4092,2,I have no idea what happened to this batch of plates because I have used Dixie products for years but this batch might as well have been those super cheap white ones you get a million of for a dollar at the dollar store. They were horrible. Super thin and certainly not usable for anything juicy. They were barely adequate for a sandwich. I use a lot of paper plates so I may wait a while and try again but not this particular one.
4093,3,"They came a little warped. They aren't really flat so it can be hard to serve the food on them. I like them better still than foam plates or the super thin paper plates. If you put something saucy or a little heavier on the plate, you need to add a second plate under it to help sturdy it up some or it will leak and/or roll off the plate on you."
4094,3,"I can't return this item because I've used it but I will certainly check next time I buy luggage on Amazon. The lining had a zipper which would have been nice, had the zipper been on the outside of the lining and not the inside. I had to pry the zipper down the best I could to pack clothes into lining part, doesn't anyone do an inspection on their products?"
4095,2,"I bought this roller because the size was exactly what I needed for a carry-on and loved the style. After maybe a year and a half of minimal use, the handle catches and now won't go all the way down. I called Amazon to see about a replacement handle and they told me that since I had purchased it more than a year ago, there was nothing they could do. I get it. Suitcases don't last forever. But they should definitely last for a year and a half with minimal use! Really sucks to have to buy a totally new roller after a short period of time. Definitely not buying anything Amazon Basics ever again."
4096,1,"I purchased this for an upcoming trip. First time being used on a trip one of the wheels broke off while moving through the airport. Even though it was my first trip with the luggage, Amazon customer service refused to help because it was purchased six months ago. Needless the say I was very disappointed with the quality of the product and I was surprised by the unusual lack of customer support. I do not recommend buying this product. I would give zero stars if it was an option."
4097,3,"I recently acquired this suitcase and used it for two trips in September 2018. On my most recent flight from the UK to the US the Telescope Handle got stuck in it's up position as I was attempting to get through security. Fortunately, with assistance, we were able to get the telescope handle to lower back into the suitcase using brute force. I really liked the design and maneuverability of this suitcase, but would caution you to be extremely gentle with the telescope handle."
4098,1,The wheel on the side with the handle came off during our first flight. This is terrible.I've always been a firm believer of the Tumi luggage bag. I travel for work (at least once a month) and I travel for pleasure (probably two international trips a year and a handful of domestic trips). I use to travel more than that... but that's not the point. I had to buy my kid brother a luggage bag as we were visiting family in China and when we got this bag back from the conveyer belt sans one wheel.. it was major disappointment (so much that I had ordered a bigger one that I sent back). Look.. if you always take it on board and treat it with care.. yes you can probably use this for a while. If you EVER have to check this bag.. you will probably lose a wheel...
4099,3,"HIGE DESIGN FLAW with luggage rendered worthless if zipper fails, which it did for me on first use.Lovely set however the very first time we used the largest of the 3 pieces of luggage the suitcase zipper broke and hence the entire contents of the luggage spilled out everywhere. And since the design of the luggage completed depends on the zipper holding the two halves of the hard-shell luggage together, and the zipper was then damaged, the luggage was completely useless and couldn't carry anything without my holding the two halves together. I was stuck on the other side of the country with a ton of clothes (it is a large suitcase and carried quite a lot of clothes) and no suit case.This is a huge design flaw because the integrity if the 3 suit cases depends on the zipper. But since the handle to carry the luggage is anchored to only one half, it means the zipper has to support the weight of the entire suitcase. This isn't so bad with the 2 smaller bags, but the largest holds a lot of clothes hence a lot of weigh hence the zipper is almost guaranteed to fail very quickly in my case. I know Samsonite brands themselves as durable luggage, but I don't know how this flaw could have passed stress testing, so I wonder if they ever actually tested the largest of the Winfield 2 Fashion set."
4100,1,"Not sure why it reads hardside as it is so thin and Flimsy Feeling. I know I read the reviews but honestly felt why not give it a shot but when I got it, the box was taped but busted open and was holding on by 2-3 inches on one side. Took out and boy it feels thinner than any luggage I’ve owned. Super thin and I’m sure it will scratch EASY.Update 10/10/18 - first time going to use this because this is the whole reason I bought it, not sure why there are zippers that only open to the inside shell. No padding on the i side where you place clothing. Have to use something firm to keep it from putting marks of the hand rail support. Zipper is backwards so not sure about the usage of it. I dropped it from 2 stars to 1 star because now I’m really disappointed and I’m sure I’ll end up using it even less. Depressing for sure as I leave in 3 hours for the weekend. I’ll post pictures AND NO WAY TO TIGHTEN THE STRAPS, so unless you pack it to the max your clothing will just fall to the bottom. Being retired military you’d think I would have looked at this before waiting until the day of the trip. SMH. No straps on other side so everything you put in this side will for sure end up at the bottom. JUST SAD FOR SURE. *** STAY AWAY FROM THIS ***."
4101,2,"I had plans this summer to travel for 6 weeks for a combination of work and pleasure. I already have a small hard shell with 4 wheels that I absolutely love, and I thought going up in size would be the perfect way to make these trips tolerable. Boy was I wrong.This suitcase was engineered by someone who failed basic physics. There are 2 fundamental flaws with it:1. The wheels: The 4 tiny wheels are absolutely NOT designed to carry the bulk of this suitcase. While mine haven't completely broken off yet, they are barely hanging... after just 6 weeks of use!2. The size(?): The whole points of the 4 wheels is to be able to roll the suitcase without having to bear any of the weight yourself. This feature is literally impossible with this bag. I have to roll it with two hands, which leads to me tripping on it/kicking it every other step. So then I try rolling it while bent over it, and that just doesn't work either because my back gives out after a while. So then I just roll it the way I would a 2 wheeler which is just stupid given what this is designed to do. I don't know how this passed testing.Unfortunately I bought this just before a trip and by the time I came back, it was out of the 30 day return window. I absolutely regret this and will forgo buying from this brand in the future given how poorly designed this bag was."
4102,1,"I purchased this product and decided it was better to go with Samsonite over any other brand because of their reputation and warranty. However, the very first time I used it, I was half way across the world and realized the zipper does not close. I had to buy a strap to keep it closed in the airport. I am lucky all my luggage did not fall out. I could not return it to Amazon because it was beyond their 30 day limit. I opened a warranty support ticket with Samsonite and never heard back after a month of waiting. I called Samsonite on my day off (they're only open M-F 9-5) and they said I have to pay for shipping this huge suitcase to the repair center or I can drive it to the nearest store an hour away and they will ship it for free. This is not the quality, warranty, or service that I thought made the Samsonite name. The warranty support person was not helpful at all, ignored my questions and was not willing to understand how I am being charged extra and inconvenienced for their manufacturing defect.Bottom line, do not go with this product or any Samsonite product for that matter."
4103,3,"Very disappointed with product warranty. Purchase 4 bags in February 2017, 11 months ago. All have had light , if any use, to date. The zipper of one, which had very light use, only 2 overnight car trips, is opening (failing) without cause. And while it corrects itself, when reclosing the zipper, it happens again, without warning or cause: thus, not reliable. Called Samsonite customer service, explained situation, and told that I must ship it to one of their repair centers, to distant states, which is not only very burdensome, but costly, particularly in view of a replacement of only $80 or so! Very, very disappointed that Samsonite would not rectify their faulty product (or loss) equitably."
4104,1,"Not even 3 trips and the zipper busted on me mid trip my second use. Scratches very easily. If you’re willing to spend $50+ for a one time use bag look no further. Sometimes cheaper isn’t always best - looks like I’ll be purchasing another bag not even a month later. Thanks amazon for suggesting such a terrible product. Not even going to go for the exchange refund mess, I’ll take this $60 as a loss and expensive lesson in quality. Stay away if you’re a frequent traveler!!!"
4105,3,"I loved the look and idea of this suitcase. Perfect size for what we needed, everything seemed great and I was super happy with it…then we got off the plane and headed to baggage claim. All our stuff had been placed in a bag because the suitcase busted open during the flight. This was the FIRST USE! However, too much time had passed since I purchased to return the item. I do not recommend this suitcase at all.UPDATE: After reading my review, the seller did reach out to me and refund my money. They also said they would look into the issue with the suitcase breakage."
4106,1,"My husband and I love to travel and I needed a medium suitcase that was sturdy enough to take the beating of the airlines and in another color besides black since we are going on vacation soon prime would be my option Couldn’t wait to get it open took it out of the box and the color amazing,size perfect I took the plastic bag off and I noticed that it was scratched and scuffed on both sides the wheels dirty the inside had fuzzball’s and sand which means that it had been used returned and then shipped to me I couldn’t believe the returned label was on the box. I’m disappointed that I have to look for another suitcase and also go out of my way to return this one. Beware and check everything cause you never know I wouldn’t give any stars but you have to to add a review<U+0001F92C>."
4107,1,Do NOT buy these suitcases. Bought a full size and carry on. The zipper on the full size failed on my first trip. About to fly out on another trip and the zipper on the carry on just failed. Everything about these products are cheap and useless. Now I’m scrambling last minute to pack because the carry on let me down. I will Stick to the name brands that have a reputation. I know this luggage was on the cheaper side but I hoped to use it at least a few times. But once and done is all you get. Unreal!!!!
4108,3,"I could not get the suitcase to open even when it was in the factory mode.I followed the directions and reset the password, then followed the directions again. Still can't get it to open.I don't know what kind of tool you are supposed to use. I tried a tweezer. Very cumbersome. The company needs to provide the tool with the suitcase because they are teeny holes and I'm not sure what is supposed to fit inside them.Would be very happy if I could just deactivate the lock.No customer service number. UGH!"
4109,2,"Light weight and easy to handle if it was only well constructed. Travelpro has placed its name brand on a less than quality product. Purchased two suitcases and returned both. Used for one 10 day trip and the edge of one was frayed, zipper stuck on corners of case, and plastic guard on the bottom of one came unglued. When I called Travelpro the representative told me I purchased the wrong suitcase for traveling. I asked her if the suitcase should last more then one trip. Shame on Travelpro. Even the cardboard box it was shipped in from China was torn and punched."
4110,1,"I was so happy to find this luggage in such a beautiful color and perfect size! That is why I was so absolutely DISAPPOINTED when this suitcase came in to find it was a DARK/ DIRTY LAVENDER COLOR and not at all the beautiful dusty pink/rose that was pictured. I told myself it was fine and despite the price was still the best of others I had chosen from, but WRONG.While traveling from FL to CA and all up and down the CA coast, I realized the poor quality of the materials used. The exterior of the suitcase is great, with a logical design to pockets, sturdy material and stitching, and smooth gliding wheels, but inside it is a different story. The interior BUCKLES ARE CHEAP, the interior LINING AND NETTING ARE CHEAP, and on top of the already FALSELY ADVERTISED COLOR and PRICEY nature of the suitcase itself in comparison to others of similar specs, I was VERY DISAPPOINTED in this product. For the price of this piece I almost just went for the set and I am so glad I didn't.If this was a $50-$75 suitcase from Marshalls or Ross or somewhere I would be fine with it, but having payed $140 I truly expected something of better quality. Honestly just STICK WITH THE AMAZON BASICS SPINNER SET for $120, they're a much better quality and a fraction of the price! Granted the color selection is not as great (which is why I had originally convinced myself to get this one), but they really are amazing suitcases worth more than the price Amazon sells them for and definitely better quality than this suitcase.Additionally, despite ScotchGarding the exterior of this suitcase travel transformed the already dingy/dark lavender color of the suitcase to an even nastier looking dirty purple.SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND DO NOT BUY THIS BAG!!"
4111,3,I ordered the luggage in May 2018 to use for my Hawaii cruise in September. Then I recently used it on a Bahama cruise. I took my luggage off the ship myself and went to put the handle down to get in the Taxi to the airport and the handle would not go down. We took every thing out of the suitcase and still could not get the handle down. Luckily Delta accepted it that way at checkin. When i got home we forcefully got the handle down and now it won't come up. This is heading out to the trash! What a waste of money.
4112,2,"I needed a carry on for Europe. Our family of 6 embarked on a three week, 6 city adventure. Lots of trains and planes, stairs and cobbled streets in the rain. This bag held up great. I bought this bag because I didn’t want to worry about any size issues and end up having to check my bag. I also wanted a light bag and this bag hit the mark on both of those items. It is verblight weight and the size is perfect! I was able to expand it while I went on the trip and added keepsakes as we traveled. I love the color too! The rollers and zippers are quality and the handle worked perfectly as well. I didn’t get stuck once. It held up nicely, but this thing tipped over ALL-THE-TIME!! I even bought some stones at a market for gifts(quarts, crystals and others), they weighed about 5 lbs and I strategically placed then in the bottom back of the bag with other heaver items like my boots in hopes it would help and still it would tip! It was less times, but it still tipped!! We had a running joke about my bag as a family because it was the only one that did this and it was throughout the trip. I had to make sure it was always leaning against something when I was in the restroom, restaurant or checking my phone for ticket information. I ended up straddling it for moment stops when I had to take my hand off the handle to grab a coffee or water or whatever. As much as I love all the other qualities of the bag, the tipping issue has clouded the positive qualities. I will be shopping for another bag, even though this one is still in good condition. It was inconvenient for all of us."
4113,3,"I read all of the reviews on this prior to purchasing. It IS a great LITTLE carry on and SUPER lightweight. It is NOT 21""x14""x9""...those dimensions include the top and side handles (23"" includes the wheels). The actual size of the case is 19""x13""x8"" (if you include the pouch on the front, then it's 9"" deep. The case is 13.5"" wide at the bottom and 13"" at the top. I've been using Travelpro bags for over 30 years and I rarely check a bag, even if I'm traveling in Europe for 2 weeks. My ""old"" Travelpro is 22""x14""x9"" (actual) and I thought ""so, OK I'll give up an inch"" for the spinner wheels and a lighter weight bag.Had the description accurately reflected the actual size I would never have ordered. This was especially frustrating since the bags were ordered to use for several extended trips in May, June and July. This is a great bag for very limited packing. My husband put a pair of shoes in, and there was barely room for anything else. Needless to say, we used our ""old"" Travelpro bags and these are going back. Hello, Tumi."
4114,3,"I am giving this product a one star because the seam on this luggage separated on the first trip. On the second trip the separation turned into a total blow out epic fail!!! :) By the way I purchased this bag on 6/21/2017. And....for the record I did not over fill this luggage.I submitted an online ticket through Delsey customer service. I was not sent an acknowledgment message via email; even though, during the online process I gave my email address. After two weeks I called in to find out what the status was for my ticket. There was no record and I was advised I have to ship my luggage out of state at my cost (yes my cost) to another company to have it inspected so the ""other company"" can advise me whether it will be covered under warranty or not. If it is not covered I will be advised what the cost of repair is. By the way there is no acknowledgement/tie back to Delsey for the repair. This is now between me and the other company. Delsey Customer Service made no attempt to allow for tracking of the issue........I am now on my own.Did I mention the seam separation started on the first trip.....grrrr...Good Luck Delsey! Can you save me ""the customer"" and change this from a one star to a five star? The ball is in your court. I am sending this down to a repair company in Greenville, SC named Ayers Leather Shop. Spoke to Peyton Ayers. Real nice guy. Hopefully he pulls this out for Delsey.FYI. So far I have spent two and half hours dealing with this that includes going to UPS to ship this article. So far my cost is $35.Stay tuned Amazonians. I will provide more feedback as this plays out. Some companies end up pulling something like this out of the ditch. At this point it feels like a potential nightmare on the horizon."
4115,3,"I am a weekly traveler and purchased this bag to replace a 13 year old piece of luggage that served me well. Polycarbonate shell has not stood up well to the abuse inflicted upon it by the airlines. From day 1 this bag never rolled straight in the vertical orientation, only when being towed behind at an angle. This isn't a genuine problem, but a minor annoyance at times. The interior volume is wonderful and I can easily pack for a week on the road without using the expansion capabilities. It fits most carry on bins with the exception of small regional planes. The build feels sturdy, so I believe I will get at least a few years usage out of it before it retires.Updated: didn't even make it through 2017 before the shell cracked. Bag is still usable, however feels extremely unstable. Warranty is not valid without ""warranty hangtag"" included with packaging material. Be aware of this condition for warranty service if you purchase delsey product. I am not sure how this compares to other manufacturers however."
4116,1,"At first, i was supser excited to get this 29 inch luggage from Delsey. It looks modern, great wheels, handle is well constructed and it looks like one of the more expensive cases but the truth it's made of a cheap plastic mold. After only 6 segments, 3 trips the suitcase cracked on the bottom and up the side (See pics). I've had the suitcase for less than 8 months.The worst part is that this luggage has a 2 year warranty which is absolutely worthless if it doesnt cover the actualy plastic case Here is what the seller said, ""The manufacturers warranty usually only covers defects. For instance if the stitching is coming apart, the zipper is not working or the handle is stuck. In these cases your item would be repaired, not replaced. Damage such as wearing down of the plastic wheels or a crack in the plastic is usually caused by outside forces and will not be covered."" That's complete BS. It's luggage. It's going to be handled and tossed aroud by airline workers. This should not have broken so easilty.I paid extra money for a hardshell based on the reviews and the warranty. Dont waste your time on this cheaply made suitcase. Now i'm out all of the money because neither the seller, the manufacturer or Amazon are willing to stand behind the sale. Very disappointing."
4117,1,"We purchased two of these suitcases, having owned Delsey luggage before and having had a good experience with them. We travel a lot and know the wear and tear of the luggage. However in this case we are very disappointed. We are right now in a month long international trip and brought the new luggage with us. After the second flight we took, we noticed scratches on the sides and corners of the bags, but we were not too concerned. After the third flight we took we noticed one of the wheels was broken on one bag, and we had a real difficult time opening the other bag, as the zipper started to break. Needless to say we contacted Delsey to tell them of the issue and their response was that when we returned we should take it to a repair shop that they recommend, to see if the problems with the bags is covered under warranty. These are brand new bags that have taken three flights and already have more problems that any bag we have owned before. We plan to take the bags to the shop when we get there, but we are also going to be talking to Amazon about this problem and I will update the review to let you know what the response was from the shop. For now, we advise anyone interested in hard shell suitcases to look elsewhere as these are too delicate for travel. They do look good when you receive them at home though. Very disappointed !"
4118,3,"Immediately disappointed on the first leg of our trip when I saw my brand new luggage on the conveyor belt with a gaping hole. I had to travel to 2 countries with a luggage I had to duck tape inside and out. I know the wear and tear of luggages, but I was surprised it was just the first use. Spent a little more than I should thinking it would be sturdier and a brand that was highly reviewed. Unfortunately, my travels lasted more than 30 days beyond the return window. The color was perfect because it was easily visible from afar and was light and easy to maneuver."
4119,3,"I like the size and weight of this bag, but it doesn’t function well. I just returned from a month of travel and am disappointed in the performance of this bag. I didn’t have excessive weight in the bag but it did not roll smoothly. In addition, the telescoping handle would twist, making maneuvering a bit difficult. I will probably just use it for short trips, with limited items, as the plastic, lightweight design can handle very little weight."
4120,2,"Took this bag in the cabin for the first time after I bought it. Pros: Good size, light and easy to carry. Cons: The handle is very flimsy - it has a lot of play, so it becomes very difficult to keep the bag in a straight line when walking. The type of floor doesn't seem to matter. The wheels rotate (too) freely, and if the handle moves just a little bit, the bag goes off in a different direction. Also, the wheels are too small to drag the bag at an angle with just 2 wheels touching the ground. I am not planning to use it as carry-on baggage any longer."
4121,3,"I was very disappointed with this carry on! I was looking for something a little larger than the standard 21"". This piece was advertised at 22"", and it is NOT! Just 21"". Very light material compared to other carry ons also. I taped it, and from the floor to the top is exactly 21"". Seems like misleading advertising. I have never had to return anything to Amazon previously, but will send this carry on back."
4122,3,I was so disappointed with this item. I thought I did my due diligence by reading all the reviews and was looking forward to experiencing all the great things about this little case. The handle is flimsy and the wheels only work on smooth hard surfaces. I carried rather than swiveled through the airport. It did fit in the overhead bin nicely. Cannot speak about capacity as I was very careful not to overload. VERY disappointed.
4123,1,"Extremely disappointing! We ordered 2 of these bags for a trip to Maui and upon the return trip we found one of them had completely split at the seam on the top. We were fortunate to have not lost anything!! My husband glued it with gorilla glue because we were taking another trip shortly thereafter and it seemed to hold well but when we took the 2nd trip, the seam on the other side split!!! The reason I gave 2 stars is because mine seems to be holding up ok so far, but his is just destroyed. Based on this happening, I could not recommend this product."
4124,2,"If you want a beautiful, light-weight piece of luggage which is also easy to handle...this is the one. However, if you want a piece of luggage that maintains its lovely covering...don't buy it. After one trip to Disney upon arrival (we bought 3...myself and 2 daughters) all of us noticed how scratched and dirty they each looked. There are black marks on all sides, scuffs, scratches, etc. I tried to remove some of the smudges when we arrived home...no such luck. My piece looks as though I have used it for several years. I realize baggage handlers get called some really kooky names for the handling of bags, but to have my bag so incredibly scratched and worn-looking is disheartening. I would not buy this again. Sorry!"
4125,1,"***see added below Don’t buy this!!!It seems like a good suitcase and is an American Tourister, so I expected to last more than 1 trip. When we got off the plane in London, after a direct uneventful, flight, the suitcase had all kinds of marks and dings it it. It didn't handle being loaded up well at all. During our bus tour around the UK, pieces of the colored coating fell off every time i put it on the bed to open. Part of my routine became wiping them off the coverlet before I got into bed. I expected it to last longer and was pretty disappointed in it's durability.***added-just got back from second trip using this suitcase. The zipper split and dropped some of my belongings onto the airport floor. Do not buy thes suitcase!"
4126,3,"Saw this suitcase and given that it is American Tourister, I felt it would be a quality piece of luggage. Yes, it holds a large amount of items and the wheels, handles, zippers, etc. are great. No doubt about that.My disappointment lies in the quality....I recently flew on a major airline and checked this piece. As this was the first time I used this luggage, it was in mint condition when checked. You can imagine my disappointment when I retrieved it at my destination and it was covered in scratches, black scrapes and nicks and dents. Whereas I realized that airlines aren't very careful with how they handle luggage, it was sad to see that this piece did not hold up better and now looks like trash."
4127,2,"Love the design and the color. It holds a surprising amount and was easy to maneuver through airports and in the aisle of the plane. It's pretty light so lifting it into the overhead bin was easy. I was able to put it in the overhead bin for american airlines and unites without a problem. It held three days worth of clothes, lots of toiletries, a pair of shoes and I still had a lot of room. The handle (that you roll it with) seems flimsy, but held up surprisingly well.The only reason why it's four stars, is because the side with the handle is shallower than the opposite side because of the bars for the pull handle. Since the clothing security strap is on that side, you can't really put your toiletries on that side (or other loose items). The opposite side with the zipper is deeper and would be better for clothes. If the zipper and clothing security strap were switched, it would be perfect.Update: My first time using this as a checked bag and there were TONS of notice scratches and scruffs that don’t come off. Previously I was thinking of getting the 28” one to match, but it’s bad enough that I’m no longer considering it"
4128,3,"Although this luggage is beautiful and highly functional, I have to return it due to the chemical smell. I did not notice it when I first opened the luggage but the cloth liner had a zipper on it that allows you to get to the inside of the luggage outside hard case. When I unzipped that fabric, I instantly smelled a chemical smell...almost like gasoline or some kind of oil smell. Then I checked the ""new product"" tags attached to the handle and much to my concern, it stated: ""WARNING - This product can expose you to chemicals including Di phthalate which is known to the State of California to cause cancer...."" etc. I live in Pennsylvania but that sure doesn't mean MY suitcase does not also include this hazard (so hats off to California for being so responsible, I applaud you!) Needless to say, this luggage is getting returned!!"
4129,2,"I only used the bag once for a carry on and did not over pack it. When I bought it I loved the fact that the back of the bag was made to slip on the handle of a roller carry on. But after one use one side of the lining inside the bag ripped away from it's stitching. Very disappointed in this product. I was really hoping to get a lot more uses out of it. I had been searching for a bag like this for a while. Hopefully, I will be able to find another one that the quality of the bag is made a lot better."
4130,3,"VERY poorly made. Wore the strap to the car for my trip broke on the way to the car. Only lasted literally 100 feet before breaking! Okay I will carry it by the purse straps, but they broke carrying the bag onto the plane. Very difficult to get the bag home like that. It's a cute bag and very roomy. Just needs better stitching and a better quality stronger loop clasp. The clasp on this acted like snapable plastic. See picture. Not a good value for that price!"
4131,3,"Used for one round trip so far. I like it, but there are some design flaws. The trolley pocket feature does not work well to carry the bag on top of a carry on sized wheeled bag (as tour personal item) - this bag will slide off to the side of your luggage and become awkward. I was constantly having to stop walking to straighten it. The inner zip pocket is too small to be useful. I do like that the trolly pocket has a zip pocket. Overall, it was good, but not great. I will up to 4 stars if it holds up under heavy use use."
4132,3,"It’s spacious, fabric is thick and seems durable enough, but sadly this bag didn’t make it through its first TSA check without the zipper coming off track and rendering the bag useless. It wasn’t over-full, I wasn’t rushing or mishandling the bag. The zipper stuck and won’t unstick and I’m not paying to have it fixed, so it will be returned. Kind of a bummer, but budget bags are hit and miss in the quality/durability department."
4133,3,"The photo of this bag leads you to believe that it stands up on its own. It does not. The bottom is soft and the sides have no support. I thought it was a heavier canvass. It might as well be cotton for the amount of ""stiffness"" and hold of the fabric. It's surely roomy enough, but because the fabric has no support, it's a pain to have to dig around to find things. The bag itself is very pretty - and it's roomy, but the strap is cheap. I know the price is affordable, but the quality coincides with the low price."
4134,3,"This is an update for my earlier review.After several trips, the wheels seemed to be dragging and not gliding smoothly. So after a careful inspection, I discovered that the little screws that are supposed to be imbedded in the wheel base keep coming out. (As shown in the photos) They are digging into the wheels and causing them to get stuck And in all 4 wheels! And I NEVER check in this bag so it goes as a carry on every time thus it gets treated with kid gloves!! No reason for those screws to come out. Now I have to struggle to pull it, and that defeats the purpose of a ""spinner"".And from what I understand from reading other reviewers, the warranty is bogus. I'm going to attempt to contact the manufacturer, because basically, it's useless now."
4135,1,"AWFUL!I ordered a suitcase for my son for a month long trip to Rome.At the airport, after we showed our boarding place to the airline attendant and before we boarded the plane, the handle broke irreparably.It was an absolutely awful way to start our trip and we had to take an hour to get a new suitcase when we arrived in Italy.And because of the limitations of time, we ended up having to get a new suitcase at 3 times the price last minute. Nightmare, AVOID!"
4136,3,"I bought this suitcase in the quilt design because it looks so cute. However, case comes with a film over most of it and 1). It must have been a returned item. Someone tried to remove some of the film and scratched it. Thought I would live with it. 2). The film is super hard to remove and doesn't come off at all the hard connected parts (near handle, wheels, emblem, etc.). Just terrible and looks awful! Unfortunately, I waited too long to return this item in the allotted time (waited to take it out just before my scheduled trip). Very disappointed!!!!"
4137,3,"I bought the navy and yellow case two years ago - but we are only occasional travellers, so it has only been on 3 trips in that time. On the third trip, while walking between terminals, the handle suddenly came apart. So there I was, with a long multi-leg voyage still to go, and a suitcase that not only couldn't be wheeled any longer, but had a sharp metal rod sticking out of it that wouldn't retract.Even though the descriptions states there is a 5 year warranty, there's no information about how to claim against it - and reviews leave me doubtful that there's anything to gain by trying."
4138,1,"I can't comment on this bags durability, as it has turned out to be too smelly to use! We bought 2 of these one for each child as we were going on a big trip and wanted them to be able to pull own luggage. When they arrived they smelled of plastic/gasoline/tar. I thought they just needed to air out. My husband threw the packaging away before I could protest. I wiped them down with a damp cloth, and had them airing the garage for over a month. We even aired them on our patio for a while. When we brought them in side to pack before our trip, it smelled up the entire upstairs and it became very obvious that we could NOT be trapped in a hotel room with these things. So we managed without them. They are still in our garage and every once in a while I will pick them up to move them around and my hands smell afterwards!I've bought probably 100's of items from amazon over the last 5 years and this is is probably the first review I've given. I can't believe only a few others have complained of this! And I'm sick about us ending up with 2 and wasting our money."
4139,3,"There is nothing wrong with the case per se, but I bought it to go under the seat and found that to be problematic. I have a bad back and can not put a bag in the overhead compartment. It did go under the seat with a lot of force used. It was not over packed at all. If you are purchasing for the purchase of underseat storage, it is a struggle for me, my hub was able to do it fairly easily but it took some effort on his part. On the return flight with him we put it in the overhead. When I flied alone, I fought with it and finally got it under there. Luckily I board with need extra time/assistance so I had the time and room to fight it."
4140,3,"The look of the case and the brand name is impressive to me and that's where the pros stop. As a business traveler this rolling case was not functional at all. The design does not keep the case upright with items in it. For instance if you have a laptop in the bag along with folders the bag will tip over if you do not place it close to a wall when you let it go to keep it upright. This is an impossible task if your zipping through an airport and try to do anything other than hold the case by the handle at all times to keep it from tipping over. Also the wheels have a terrible turn radius, it's nearly impossible to steer if the bag is full with items. You will truly get a great forearm workout if you try to maneuver the case on all four wheels.This bag will be useful if you never put anything inside it, and traveled with it totally empty. It's almost easier to just carry the case like a briefcase instead of trying to roll it. But then again, you could have just bought a briefcase or a backpack instead."
4141,1,"This is by far the worst rolling laptop/overnight bag I have ever owned. I gave it 1 star because the wheels seems to work well on it. Other than that, no good. It snugly holds a 15.6"" laptop and is a struggle to get out of the bag. The zippers are like claws so if you want to get anything out of the bag, you had best open it all the way so you don't get your hands all scraped up. The zippers are too long on the compartments, too. Seems like a weird complaint, right? Well, every time you go to close a compartment the zippers from the other compartments are in your way and you have to move them out of your way. I would never recommend this to anyone looking for a truly good bag."
4142,3,"I ordered this rolling bag to carry my equipment as a home health occupational therapist. It holds my blood pressure cuff, cleaning supplies, thermometer, therapy tools, files, and various writing supplies.It works well enough to hold all my supplies and save my shoulders from repeatedly carrying a bag for long periods of time!I like that it can open flat or open slightly with buckles keeping the main compartment flap upright. It rolls relatively smoothly for its small wheels, whether on all 4 or tipped onto 2 wheels.As others have mentioned, the bag does tend to get front-heavy and tips forward easily.My biggest complaint about this bag are the ZIPPERS. They get caught up so easily. I rarely am able to smoothly pull and zipper closed on the first try. It usually ends up with me having to pull up and down several times before it zips up successfully.Overall, a fine bag for a mobile office but little annoyances like the zipper can be a downer when I rely on it everyday for multiple patient visits a day."
4143,3,The Zipper on the large compartment keeps getting stuck and caught on the inside seam causing it to malfunction. I was on line at airport screening and held up the line for what felt like an eternity trying to unjam the zipper !!. Some times it sticks and jams and other times it un zips but needs force to operate other wise I likes the size of the pockets and the 4 roller wheels.
4144,2,"The product seems like a good buy and I bought it at a great price point. But unfotunately my first time using it an inside strap broke while I was tightening it up. Bummed out, but even after my first flight using it the zipper started to pull away from the hardcase. I am upset and likely can't claim the warranty even though I will try. I don't think they allow warrenty for people who live outside of the US even though it was shipped to an APO box. I have several olympia bags and this is the last time I buy from them. My old Olympia lasted way longer even though that one too eventually got holes in the zipper."
4145,1,"I would not recommend this suitcase if you need something durable. I bought this suitcase for a trip to Europe and the wheels are already messed up. If you are simply hopping on and off a tour bus you'd probably be fine. If you are rolling it on uneven surfaces or cobblestone streets such as are common in Europe, do not buy this suitcase. After just one trip with this suitcase, the wheels are already out of alignment, which means that it gets stuck and doesn't roll on all four wheels anymore; very disappointing. The telescoping handle was also very touchy. I often had to stop for a bit to fiddle around with it and yank on it different ways until it would pop up.Items that were good: The size and setup of the suitcase compartments, the style, the casing, and feature of the handles on the side and bottom.Items that were bad: Wheels broke after one use, telescoping handle was very finicky."
4146,1,"We ordered two of these suitcases, used them as carryons on a trip to Aruba on March 27th. The first day of the trip the zipper on the expanding portion of the purple suitcase broke and the edging strip on the orange suitcase we purchased started to pull away from the suitcase itself. Just got home last night and went on Amazon and my window did return expired March 28th, the day it broke in Aruba!! If all this can happen with carrying them on imagine what damage could be done if we checked those bags! I would never purchase these again and I will not recommend them to anyone!"
4147,1,"First of all, you have to remove one of the handles for this to actually be the required new carry on size. OK, did that. Very first trip, not putting this carry-on through anything more than rolling through airports, the wheel fails and jams up. Had to carry the rolling carry-on. Very very cheap quality wheels. Contacted their customer service about the ""warranty"". Sent them the pictures. They require the customer to remove the wheel from the suitcase and identify the wheel part number for them. Then they will charge shipping for a replacement wheel. Anyway, this is cheap junk and I don't recommend buying one."
4148,3,When we get it packed the expandable handle will not come up. We have to take out way too much to get it to come up.We bought it for a trip the end of August and that was when it was first used and we just returned Oct 7. Now the window of return is done and we can't return it Really disappointed. We also bought a black one with purple trim and it works great so we know that this is a flaw in the manufacturing. Wish there was something that could be done.
4149,3,"I was excited about this item. Purchased 2 months in advance for a trip to Cabo I had over Thanksgiving, used it once on that trip and on my way back home my handle broke. Since the size is great and color is beautiful I attempted an exchange. Unfortunately since I had purchase it ahead of time it was denied. My suggestion is purchasing this item elsewhere with a better warranty/exchange Policy in the event this is a faulty item. This wasn’t a mismanagement from my part, as I have larger luggage’s, faulty product and now I’m out $60."
4150,1,"I took this bag on 4 trips. On the very first trip, the handle started to break -- it became loose and the locking mechanism started to fail. This last trip, the handle ripped completely off one of the bars at the screw, and now my suitcase is super broken. I'm not an insane traveler. I'm reasonably gentle with my suitcases. I don't carry around weights, or really much of anything other than clothes.Don't get me wrong, it's adorable and fits a ton. If it lasted, it would get 5 stars, but instead, here we are. Go buy something that will last."
4151,3,"First...the measurements were 22.5x15x10. Second...I had ordered the Red for my husband and the Purple for me, but they are not the same bag. The design is different, the inside is different, and the sizing is different. What I received (purple), doesn't even look like the photo online. His bag is 21x13.5x8.5. This is very important, as we are traveling to Europe, and don't want to check any bags. Also, looking at the purple bag, it looks used. There are scuff marks on the black corner pieces. There are a couple of marks on the case itself. I am very disappointed with this company. I will say that his bag (red) is worth 4 stars. So my bag is going back!"
4152,3,"I bought this item for a long trip to Europe. The bag has broken on my first flight from Cleveland to New York. One of the wheels (the one that is on the side where handle is) completely detached (see images). The item is no longer rolling, and I have to literally carry this 45 lbs bag. The worst thing about all these is that I can't even return it, as I'm in the middle of my trip. The only option I have is to buy some new bag and dump this one in my hotel room. Quite frustrating start of my trip."
4153,3,"I have another Kenneth Cole under seat roller that I like a lot. This came and I couldn’t believe the flimsy, thin, one-small-mishap-from-cracking joke of a bag. Honestly, I have food containers that have better quality plastic than this! Some people might say, hey, this is for on-board baggage, not going through a conveyor belt. Well, I don’t know about you, but I’ve been on many a flight where the overhead bins are filled and they make people,check their hand baggage. This “ flim-shell” will be annihilated in any checked luggage sitution and especially in cold weather where I’m pretty sure it would explode into shards of plastic with contact with other bags. If you don’t believe me, go right ahead and give it a go. When I tried wheeling it on four wheels they squeaked as well. I sent it back the very next day. Thank god for free returns and good riddance."
4154,1,"I ordered this bag for a trip abroad, and thought it would be great from other reviews. When it arrived, the chemical smell was so strong I couldn't keep it in the house. The bag arrived about 10 days before my trip, and I let it air out the entire time. The smell persisted, so I sprayed the bag with white vinegar, and sprinkled it with baking soda. Nothing worked.When I packed my toiletries the night before my flight, I could still smell it, and it transferred to my toiletry bags. Thank goodness I didn't need to pack any clothes in it.On the trip, the bag performed okay, but the fauxleather bottom started to peel on the side, and the inside zippered pocket's lining seam came apart. The bag wasn't mishandled, and it wasn't overpacked, so I feel this must be a result of the product quality.As it stands, I can't use the bag again. I would have returned, but I didn't get home in time to send it back. Wish I could at least get a replacement, as this is a bit high for one-time use.I can't recommend...maybe others will have better luck. I may try to reach out to the seller to see if they offer any options. If so, I'll update this review."
4155,1,"Ordered this bag as part of the luggage we would use on our anniversary cruise. Bag has beautiful lines, quality fabric and size. Exactly what we wanted. However, one of the shoulder strap clips broke before we made it home... ;-(Update: Seller contacted me and sent a new bag and strap. Have only used it once but it hasn't broken. Not sure what to think about the quality as it looks the same as the original clip. Will have to see if it lasts."
4156,3,"Beautiful looking travel bag. Quality looks good for the price. I bought the grey one and it’s classy looking.However, the cross body straps are ridiculously long. I’m 5’4” and could not wear the cross body straps at the shortest level.Now here’s the problem, even if I created new holes to make it shorter (the straps looks like a belt). The left-over length is so long it hangs past the straps. It just looks sloppy and not clean looking. Disappointed I spent the money and now the time to have to fix it and make it look good in order for it to be functional to me.I travel with kids and a cross body bags are a must! I’ve been traveling with a similar looking diaper bag that I love, however, it doesn’t have the slot to slip over your luggage handle I needed.Giving it a 3-star. Nice looking bag minus the cross body straps I use the most being way too long."
4157,3,"I was excited to take this bag on my trip. It arrived in a timely matter, as does most Amazon fulfilled items. Unfortunately, I was using the bag as a carry-on and as soon as I walked into the airport at the start of my trip the clasp for the shoulder strap broke. Therefore I was unable to hold the bag as a cross-body bag as intended and had to use the hand straps. The bag itself is roomy and good quality, but the clasp was not."
4158,3,I received this bag today. It is everything I would want in a bag (for the price). Perfect for a personal bag while flying. Seems to be able to hold quite a bit of things in it.... but I just CANT GET PAST THE HORRIBLE SMELL. It is so strong that I will probably be returning it & I hate that because it could have been the perfect bag. I am scared to try to wash it to get the smell out because then it will not be returnable. Any advice would be appreciated because I really had high hopes for the bag.
4159,3,"Really, really cute, and has some really nice features. But it has a few serious design flaws.1) It has a strap at the back so you can attach it to another roller bag, but the wheels are so tall that it doesn't stack on top of other bags without making them so heavy they fall over.2) The bottom frame of the handle takes up a huge amount of room inside. It seems large enough to hold a ton of stuff, but on the inside the space is so chopped up by the frame that it's hard to pack things in it.3) The handle is so flimsy. It stuck about half the time I tried to extend it, and when it does extend it's floppy."
4160,3,I used the tote for one flight and will never use it again. It's a lightweight tote with absolutely NO interior support for the sides; I had to continually readjust my items in the bag to attempt to balance it so it would not tip while rolling. It's perfect as a duffle and fits a ton of stuff in it- except the wheels don't fold in. The tote fit easily under the airplane seat and I love the color however the frustration of having to drag my rolling bag all of the way across LAX like a dog being drug on a leash was a deal breaker.
4161,1,"I bought this bag because it had four wheels instead of just two. I thought it would be great for travel and I had a big trip coming up. Also, it was on the smaller side so I figured it'd be great for overhead on the plane. Compact is great. I packed it up and off we went. We got to our destination and when I grabbed the straps to put it in the rental car, it just slipped right off. Cute bag but this is not a good brand. I have a large hard-sided suitcase in the same brand and it also fell apart (the interior) during the first packing. On a positive note, the wheels rolled very smoothly. Too late for me to get a refund, unfortunately. Just beware about this bag and brand...."
4162,3,"I was in search of a lightweight tote that could be used to carry my work laptop to the office when taking a bus at least one day per week and also clothes/shoes etc. when traveling out of state for the company. This tote had two main openings (one for the main cavity and other for smart device/table, pens, etc.). It could not accommodate my laptop which is in 13.25 in width, 9 in length and 7/8 in depth in the main cavity. It had two other compartments on the side of the tote which could be used for wallet, smart device, small water bottle, etc. It did not roll smoothly (jerked a lot) over all surfaces. It also fell very easily especially when the handle was extended. The positive features included it was very, very lightweight and east to lift.I tested four rolling totes for about 3 weeks each. I found the Tumi Voyageur Oslo 4-Wheel Compact Carry-On worked overall best for me. It had everything: organization (6 sections - laptop sleeve, hidden compartment that I sometimes cannot find, pens/pencils/smartphone/ruler compartment and two sealed compartments for clothes and shoes), lightweight, small size, rolled very easily, lifted easily It cost more but I kept the Tumi rolling tote and have used it for local travel including on weekly bus trips and also took on the plane last week with me. It can easily lay under the seat in front of you but not the aisle seat which is too small for anything but a purse or folded coat.This luggage didn't work for me because of the laptop size, difficulty to roll, and instability but it may work for you."
4163,3,"Love the bag and it fits under the airplane seat. But it’s construction is JUNK with the minor exception of the zippers, which are smooth and easy to use. It is not sewn together well at all. The handle broke on the first use so I’m stuck on the other side of the world with a bag that’s causing more trouble than it’s worth just so I can schlep it home to return it. As nice as the size is, the manufacturing must be Chinese. Don’t waste your money."
4164,3,"I liked the overall look and internal design, and it is a nice quality fabric. But the telescopic or retracting handle did not work consistently. It would not stay locked and was annoying when it kept collapsing. Also I could not use the strap to attach to my larger suitcase as the design at the back of the bag is too tall and therefore when I tried to slip it over my larger suitcase handle there wasn't enough space to pull my larger suitcase as the smaller bag kept crushing my fingers as there is not enough space between the handle on my suitcase and the top of the carry on (hard to explain). But it just couldn't work. Which was doubly annoying when having to pull two pieces of luggage and the smaller bag telescopic handle kept collapsing."
4165,3,"Purchased this rolling carry-on after looking all over for one that was not too large and would fit under the airline seat.Used it for the first time in January - it holds a lot of ""stuff""...laptop, electronics, purse, etc. I thought I was going to love it. The 2 Star rating is due to the fact that the handle does not lock into place which makes it hard to use. Pulls very smoothly and easily, but the handle falls back in to the ""down"" position as soon as it is released. If it weren't for that issue, which I think is a defect, I would be giving a 5 Star rating. Love the black color accented with hot pink!"
4166,1,"I loved this product in the beginning, perfect size for carry on and for laptop and files. As noted in previous reviews, even fits one change of clothes. As you can see from the picture, the front pocket goes almost all the way around but only has one zipper and it already broke after 6 months of use. I paid $70 and read all of the reviews and thought I found the perfect bag. I contacted the company with no response!!! I would NOT recommend this bag to the business traveler and now I will not buy any of their Zegur's products due to NO response."
4167,2,I really wanted to LOVE this roller. Loved the size and the colors and the practicality of it. The first time I used it was to travel to Sweden this past July.It managed to get through LAX with no problem...all was great...Sadly...when I was in the airport retuning home the metal pull on the top of the bag decided to not stay up...i d pull it up and it would just go back down on its own...so I ended up doing what I was trying NOT to do.Which is CARRY the bag! The entire purchase was based on the metal bar so I could roll it. This was very disappointing.The expensive roller bag turned into a carry bag on one trip! Highly dissatisfied and would probably cost more then the bag to go fix! What a waste!
4168,3,"I liked the bag and it fit my purposes which was to carry the required batteries for a Portable Oxygen Concentrator and my personal electronics. On th first use, it fell and my 84 year old husband fell over it at the airport. The handle broke and was of no use. This was In mid April, 2018. I didn’t report it because it fell over. Now I wish I could contact the manufacturer, since It should not break after a simple fall. Can anyone tell me how to make this claim. I wanted to love this bag."
4169,3,Poor quality. First week into my travels a metal snap inside fell off. Will return as soon as I get home. The absence of pockets and dividers insides causes a total mess up of inside’s contents. Need ingenious packing to avoid a mess of things once you start wheeling the bag.
4170,3,"Used this bag since Sept 2017. It does the job, although it was never really the most convenient thing to roll around. The wheels are pretty cruddy. There's a lot of interior space though which is nice, and I've never had a problem carrying it on. I've traveled mostly domestically, with a trip to Japan in the middle. By this month (June 2019) the wheels finally gave out and the fabric above it ripped, causing it to be impossible to be rolled.Honestly I always found it a little inconvenient to roll anyway. Looking into a carry-on bookbag to replace it."
4171,3,"Positives: I purchased very inexpensively ($39.00). So great bag for that price. Not a great bag if I had to pay more. Lots of room, holds a lot of stuff. Side pockets, 2 on each side are handy and spacious. Very light weight. Fits into airline overhead.Negatives: Flimsy, especially the zippers. Not all that stable when pulling on wheels. Wheels are not on the outside so narrow wheelbase causes it to tow a bit erratically. Pull out handle is cheap and does not lock into place."
4172,1,"I was excited to give this bag to my husband for an upcoming business trip. It is the perfect carry on size and was going to make his travel so much easier. Upon getting the the airport and using the bag, before he even reached his gate the feet that help the bag stand upright when using the telescoping handle, broke off in pieces. I am highly disappointed that it broke within the first hour of use. Would not recommend."
4173,3,Like the size. Plenty of pockets for organizing your wardrobe. But unfortunately the zipper moved past the stop point and and came off bag. Return is past deadline and I can’t seembyo get an answer on defective material warranty.
4174,1,"This luggage is poorly made; the extended handles are flimsy and wobbly, the wheels get stuck on the thinnest cracks and that's after you have to kick the bag to get it started moving, and then the handles just slip down out of position as you're walking. It's junk, but you won't realize it until one or two trips, then it's too late to return. Don't waste your money!"
4175,3,The bags are great except that after one use the interior seams of the large bag have wrapped badly. I am trying to contact the supplier but it is not a straight forward process it seems.Follow up - I did reach the suppliers and they were helpful. The bag was out of the return period (as happens when you buy luggage for a future trip). They offered a $20.00 refund for me to have it repaired myself or send it in for repairs under the warranty.
4176,3,The luggage showed up in good time and looked beautiful. However I used it right away and the airlines got it wet. Just from one trip the large bag is ruined. The front of it wrinkled and pilled all from getting rained on. I would have hoped that Steve Madden would have held up better. It's only been on one trip so far so I'm not sure how it is going to hold up to frequent travel.
4177,3,"The set is nice but BIG ISSUE...the largest bag was missing a zipper on one of the pockets!! Then the smallest bag looks like it should have a tassel on it but that's missing too. I can deal with the missing tassel, but to have NO ZIPPER is ridiculous!!EDITED on May 25, 2018 to add:** I brought this down to 1 star because I contacted the seller and still have not gotten a resolution to the no zipper issue! **."
4178,3,"I loved the look of this luggage so I convinced my now husband to buy it for our honeymoon to Europe. When we went to baggage claim in Rome, I was disappointing by the scuffs that showed up so easily on the black sides. I would have been fine if it just wiped off, but it didn't seem to come off with simple rubbing. When packing for the return flight, we ended up having to check all 3 bags because the zippers didn't look strong enough to pack any single bag with extra items in it, but even after making sure we didn't over-stuff any single bag, the zipper seam had ripped by the time we got our bag back in the states. I wanted to love this suitcase set, but they should be made to last more than one trip!"
4179,1,"I purchased this product a in order to have a new carry-on that fits the new, more restrictive airline baggage policies. A year and a half later, the handle has already broken under normal use. The button had gotten stuck in the down position before, and although I was able to use a key and pull it back up, it appears that now the handle won't even function anymore. Pushing the button no longer releases the handle and there is definitely a quality control defect with how this product is put together. I am surprised that a reputable brand could release a product that isn't even durable under normal use. I will be purchasing a new bag from a different brand and will attempt to get this fixed, but I do not plan on using this bag anymore. I would HIGHLY recommend to skip this brand and buy something that is actually well built and will last several years."
4180,3,"Overall this suitcase seems well made EXCEPT for the handle. I just used it for the first time and the handle is not only really wobbly but it doesn't lock when you only extend it half way and it's difficult to retract from full height. Additionally, it gets stuck going in and out if your suitcase is packed semi tight or tight. I might think this was a fluke but realized after purchasing that this is the same suitcase that my husband has had to replace the handle twice on and finally tossed it recently after only a year or two of light use. Unfortunately this one might be going the same way since I'm already outside the return window upon first use and the handle already fails to work properly."
4181,3,"Used this this past week for the 3rd time since buying it in April of 2017-its roomy but that's where the upside ends. Not only did the zipper corrode, two wheels also ""froze"" up (no it didn't get wet) and the piping decided to fray. I cant believe it as I've owned a Swiss briefcase in the past and it was top shelf in both quality and durability. Of course i didn't buy the protection plan and nothing can be done about it now, just warning anyone else from making the mistake of wasting good money on this. With all the negative reviews, you would think this would have been addressed by the company."
4182,3,"Purchased this in March and it has only seen light use. Probably 3 RT Flights and a handful of car trips. Total, under 10. However, one of the wheels de laminated from the spindle (see picture) causing it to now drag and stop the wheel when the softer rubber part of the wheel either spins off the spindle or pulls off and seizes the wheel entirely. See picture. I contracted Warranty Return and I have to ship this on my own dime to have it assessed/fixed or replaced. The shipping cost is prohibitive and I believe this policy and lack of authorized repair centers are designed to be a deterrent for warranty replacement or repair. Especially for a model at this price point. Therefore, all things considered, this is not a worthwhile product nor workmanship and unless it's an expensive piece. If the piece fails, as it did with me, the cost of warranty repair or replacement shipping will likely not justify the effort."
4183,1,I bought a similar one 10 years ago and I've traveled the world with it. It was starting to break down so I purchased this bc they're the same brand and size. I've only had it a few months and taken two trips and it's looking bad. I'm a little disappointed.Edit: I’ve taken 5 trips with this bag now. The handle is broken and I can’t use it. The warranty is only valid with a receipt from the official website. Don’t waste your money!
4184,3,Bought this two weeks ago - on first trip with it the zipper snapped off. I will exchange via amazon ad try again but agree it should be built better - although it looks fantastic. The jury is out on the clamshell design vs. just a zippered top. I love the looks and I will give it another try and if needed will just go back to my zero Haliburton tin can - it's 20 years old and indestructible.March 2017 update - Well - I received a replacement and now on the second trip with it the handle fails to retract half the time the button needs to be depressed repeatedly for it to collapse. At the end of the day a great looking suitcase but quality is horrible.
4185,3,"I regret buying this bag. I like the clamshell design and mesh pockets. Overall, good design, but the materials aren't well thought out. I travel every week and the front of the bag is already showing scuffs from typical airline use of going into the overhead. The metal for the handles on the back of the bag is scratched and sharp from dragging over stairs and curbs. Now, one of the wheels (which were initially so quiet) is clicking loudly and creating an embarassing noise as I go through the airport. I had a Samsonite bag from Costco for 1/3 of the price before... it lasted five years. I'm not expecting that I'm going to get five months out of this bag at this rate."
4186,3,"UPDATE: Great marketing, poor product. This bag actually lasted us about three trips before the corners developed scuffs and holes. I have had other recent trouble with Timbuk2 quality (on the Command bag), so I believe this company, while innovative with cool marketing), need to spend more time and money on quality. The other problem that has developed is the handle jams when retracting it. We have had to struggle with manually pushing in the stop tabs. Innovative features are great, but don't matter if the bag does not last. Finally, customer service isn't so great. They respond all cute and cavalier-like, but pictures won't do. They want you to send the bag to them (at your expense) so they can take a look and tell you whether or not they will charge you for the fix. I was once a Timbuk2 fan, bit no more for me.-------This bag has large roller blade wheels that make it easy to travel with as a carry-on. Its stable when loaded, so we did not have trouble with the bag falling forward. There are two pockets on the front, one for a 13"" laptop (or some papers and a binder), and the other for chargers or possibly for your liquids. The bag opens up to two compartments separate by mesh. The compartment on the back of the bag is a full compartment covered with zippered mesh. Great for keeping things together. The compartment on the front side of the bag has a full compartment (Accessible from outside the bag as mentioned later), but also has two smaller mesh compartments for socks, chargers, etc. Another great feature is that when the bag is closed, you can still access the large interior front compartment via a pair of zippers hidden under a lip on the outside of the bag. Great idea to be able to access a portion of the inside storage so easily."
4187,3,"Typical Timbuk2 excellent design and execution, is disappointingly -- or deceptively? -- not sized as indicated. The Medium's measurements are shown on the website to be measured from floor to top of handle, which is the correct way to measure (e.g., from United's website: ""The maximum dimensions for a carry-on bag are 9 inches x 14 inches x 22 inches (22 cm x 35 cm x 56 cm), including handles and wheels.""). However, when measured properly, this bag measures just over 23"" -- that is, it's not in compliance. The bag was not measured by Timbuk2 including handles and wheels, even though the graphics on their site seem to show that it was -- instead, the measurements are for the bag only. If you get this bag for domestic travel, you might be forced to check it (for that matter, if you get the small for international travel, it's not in compliance either). Timbuk2 is far from alone in using deceptive measurements, the majority of bagmakers seem to do the same."
4188,3,"This bag looks great and the reviews are consistently good; which, after much research and consideration led me to purchase it. However, my first impression upon receiving this bag was that the design is lacking in several main areas. As a mechanical engineer I am very picky when it comes to design and build quality. One of the main reasons I purchased this bag was because of the robust looking, external telescopic handle and skateboard wheels. Awesome concept but the design and build quality really let me down. This was apparent upon my first time using this bag. The release mechanism inside the tubes is not supported well and therefore rattles around when you're rolling on anything rougher than a polished airport floor. The rattling is amplified by the tubes and it is utterly annoying especially for a bag that you just dropped $200+ on. I tried to contact Timbuk2 on their customer support line but after three failed attempts just gave up. Fast forward 10 months later while on a trip to Europe rattling down the streets of Dubrovnik the telescopic tube assembly fails completely; pulling apart at one of the joints. The release mechanism was giving some problems in the previous weeks randomly jamming open.. which didn't surprise me given how loose the internals seem to be. When the thing finally broke I had to resort to tying a scarf around the handle and pulling it around.. for two weeks more!! The other main complaint I have about this bag is that the corners are not sufficiently protected. It would have been easy to mount some plastic corner plates on the bottom half but they didn't do it and trust me, it will get frayed and scuffed on your first trip outside of a car trunk."
4189,1,"I ordered two of these for me and my son because United Airlines is super picky about their carry-on luggage policy and economy ticket holders cannot bring a full-size carry-on on board. These are the PERFECT size for passengers who must store their bag under the seat in front of them. HOWEVER, these are very cheaply made and the long strap on BOTH bags lasted ONE DAY before ripping off. Totally bummed. Spent the rest of our vacation just using the short handles. It is nice to be able to lock the piece (for luggage storage at hotel)... but don't waste your money if you're wanting to use the shoulder straps."
4190,1,"I bought the two pack of these, one for myself and one for my wife. They hold quite a lot and fit under the airplane seat very well. When we got to the airport and my wife picked hers up by the handle and put the strap over her shoulder. The strap immediately broke where it was poorly sewn to the bag and her bag fell on the ground. I had a camera in my bag and didn’t trust the strap after that. The bags are made of very lightweight material so they don’t hold their shape when you set them down on the bottom. The zipper on mine felt like it was going to fail. It did not move easily. Unless you are broke you should not buy this."
4191,3,"REVISED- I wrote my previous review BEFORE traveling. On my first day of travel, after about 30 minutes of carrying it by the long strap over my shoulder the strap broke! Ripped completely from its seam. Then a couple of days into the trip the other bag broke the exact same way. Also, a few days into our trip I noticed the inside liner that divided the outside pocket from the rest was also separating from the top seam. The bags are garbage and a huge waste of money.Previous review-After trying to squeeze souvenirs in my purse for a return flight recently I decided it was time to maximize my carryon space. This was a great deal at 2 for $22. Bags are spacious..fully open on the inside with one outside pocket. Exactly what I was looking for! (And it's under the max specs for american airlines so no issues there)."
4192,3,"This bag is very satisfactory to use for storing multiple containers of nutritional supplements.In January, I bought a pair of these bags in navy as a multipack, and they arrived in the same box. At that time, the navy bag was also offered as a single for about $18.This time, in August, the offering is a single black bag for $17.99 and the multipack (2x black) for $31.99. Since I want two, I ordered the multipack, and a pair of locks to go with them.The locks and one bag arrived in the same box.I had read questions saying only one bag was received.I tried, so far unsuccessfully, to make them understand that the 2x black is a multipack; it is not a more expensive bag than the single offering. The single bag is the same bag, same size, same color, same capacity; just not a multipack, hence the cheaper price."
4193,3,"The strap on one of these bags broke within five minutes of walking through the airport. Had anything fragile or important been stored in that bag, it could have easily been damaged or broken. By the end of our weeklong trip, both bags were fraying in multiple spots. Although the bags were a nice size and fit easily underneath airplane seats, their poor quality outweighs any positives."
4194,2,"I bought a pack of these in May 2018 so I could keep rolls tucked in my cars and my dog show gear. I wasn't planning on using them all up in 3 months time. When I opened the console in my car today, bits of green stuff fell out. The roll of Earth Rated poo bags -- of which I'd used maybe one or two -- had begun to decompose. Which I realize is the point, but it makes them useless to me. Not sure if it was the heat or just time, but my car looks like someone shook out a can of green fish food inside. I want to do what's right for the planet, but I also need to know my poo bags will be there when I need one. Now I have to try and remember where I stuffed the other rolls and see if they need to be thrown away. Bummer."
4195,1,"These bags are sealed so tightly that you can't open them after you tear them off from the roll. I don't always have a lot of time to walk my dogs and I want them to get exercise and fun. Instead I have to stand next to their poop, swearing up a storm, holding them back from the walk they need, as I struggle to open these bags to pick up the poop. Twice I had to leave w/o picking up b/c the bags simply would not open. Once I stood there so long, trying to open one of the bags, that my friend to called to see if I was OK (I was very late getting back). I went back both times with normal bags, but someone had already stepped in one of the piles I had to abandon. I felt *terrible.* I stopped using the bags after that. I was doing to donate them to the dog park, but why would I want other dog people to have the same frustration? If you have a very tiny dog I guess you could use the bag as a sheet, like a piece of newspaper, to pick up after them. But if you need an actually bag that opens, these won't help you."
4196,1,"Beware of Scented Bags! Fragrances usually contain pesticides, unless they are derived directly from essential oils, which can be quite toxic to biological organisms such as yourself and your dog. The odor of these bags is quite overwhelming, so this made me quite suspicious of it's origins. The company hid behind their ""proprietary"" formulas and refused to disclose the ingredients of the scents, then stood behind the organization codes of the industry that creates these toxic formulas for cologne and perfumes which does not lead me to a higher level of trust. Not very earth friendly if you ask me. Stay away, if you want to be earth friendly. You can go with their unscented bags, which they basically told me to buy instead if I was concerned. Apparently, they are not!"
4197,3,"These reviews are completely insane. Where do they get these people and what/how are they paying them to make up such nonsense? Seriously, why are people so excited and positive about the bags and saying they smell great? Nothing could be further from the truth. These bags stink to high heaven. Not kidding – my entire beautiful home smells like old lady soap now. Lavender??? You’re kidding right? It smells more like really bad Irish Spring soap from the 70s. Yes, the bags are strong and do their job well. But dear God, the smell! When you live in a part of the country where fresh lavender grows along the roadside and pure lavender essential oils are available at every farmers market, it is a complete joke to claim these are lavender-scented. I don’t know where they got their scent. But it ain’t lavender, folks. The disgusting smell of these bags permeates the air and takes over your home. Only solution- store them outside. Get through the bags and buy something else. Ugh. Can’t wait to work through all of these. For the first time ever I’m hoping my dogs poop up a storm so I can use up- and be rid of- all of these smelly bags"
4198,3,"I bought these bags thinking the are eco friendly and biodegradable. Having read the item description and some of the answered questions made me believe those bags were “eco friendly” and biodegradable. When I received the product, there was NO mention of “biodegradability” whatsoever anywhere inside or outside the box. So I went back and carefully read the item description to then realize, it was marketed as a eco friendly (made from 100% recycled material, paper core roll 100% recycled, name of the product etc) but actually, it’s just regular one way disposable plastic! Made out of 100% recycled plastic is better than nothing, but that doesn’t change the fact that it will still end up in a landfill or in the ocean (I wanna see the person who’s gonna empty out a dog poop bag and RECYCLE the bags again).... so overall, NOTHING about this bag is eco friendly. Yes, the scent is great, the bags just like any other plastic bag functional (what else is there to say about a poop bag)....but the marketing here is misleading!I don’t even understand how it’s even legal to use any kind of disposable one way plastic, especially not for poop bags..... we take poop, which is natural matter and will eventually break down and disappear - but instead we put it in a PLASTIC bag that’s going to fill a landfill for the next couple hundreds of years?? Sending back and getting some actually eco friendly poop bags.... bags like this should be banned off the market!"
4199,3,"I just got this today and I am SO grateful for it!!! We have a 40 pound female rescue who is about 6 months old. She is HIGH energy, but also highly trainable. She just likes to play dumb. Going after kitties to play despite her size, jumping on people, barking non-stop, digging in garbages...you name it, she likes to do it! So the first shock this afternoon came after she was digging in the garbage. I verbally said no several times, beeped her several times, buzzed her several times, and finally, gave her the level 15 shock. That did it. She responds to the beep amazingly! She has gotten another shock since as she was going after the kitties, but she is doing so well!!! I am SO happy to finally have the opportunity to spend more time praising her!I have never used a shock collar, have never had the need, but this girl was proving to be a tough cookie. I worried about hurting her, damaging her spirit, etc, but I can see that this is going to bring out the very best in her.Update: I've had this less than a week and the remote stopped working unless it is plugged into the charger. Neither the display screen nor the buttons work unless it is plugged into the charger. All attempts to contact DogCare have been in vain. So for that, I have dropped the rating from a full 5 stars to 1."
4200,3,"Update: This worked great until the shock prongs completely broke right off. When I purchased it, they said if I gave a good review, I'd be sent an additional collar. I did, they sent it. BUT apparently my remote won't work with it and I need the new updated remote. What a headache.......................I've been using this collar for 2 weeks now and love it. Our past collars never worked well and always seemed cheaply made. Not this one. The remote is easy to understand and I love the battery life indicators. I've barely had to use the shocker because my dog reacts great to the beep. It must be just the right pitch to bother him enough to listen. Everything about the collar and remote is nice and sturdy (our dog broke the last one). I can't see him being able to break this one. I use it on a 60lb. Dalmatian and the shock on only 25 seems to be enough, I could see turning it up just a bit if he really wasn't listening."
4201,1,"I originally was super happy with the product, the instructions are very straight forward and clear and the collar easy to use......BUT !product details indicate 15 days stand by time for the reciever to hold charge ,manual says 40 daysand real life proves its only 5 days !!dont fall for this garbage this is all out the box !!!PLUS !to add insult to the mugging, i dont even have a month with the product and its already defective, it fails to respond many times, and the beep stays stuck , thankfully its not the vibration or shock that stays stuck.... YETPURE GARBAGE !BUY ONLY IF YOU DONT HAVE ANYONE ELSE TO GIVE $39 DOLLARS TO AND WANT A DISPOSIBLE OVER PRICED COLLAR ."
4202,1,So originally when I bought it was amazing and bings where going great when the remote to the collar started not working. Placed a bad review because it had been a little over a month since I had bought it. In attempts to make things right they sent me another college.. well this wknd .. the dollar its self will not hold a charge and is not working. Color nor remote was ever near water or placed on my dog in the rain because obviously I don’t believe that it was waterproof as stated .. idk what’s wrong with this product but for to not work twice on m something is going on. You pay too much for it to not even last 6 months. I would recommend another product from a different company. Hopefully I’ll find a better one the third go around.
4203,1,"I wasn't crazy about the idea of an ecollar but after reading reviews and instructions online, I decided to get one for my 6 month old poodle mix . I was specifically looking for an ecollar for small dogs and this ecollar come up on my search as highly rated. First off the product is way to big for a small dog. The remote is big and cumbersome. My dog didn't respond much to the sound and vibration. I tasted the shock on myself and it was fine. The product was set to 30 shock rate out of 100...I lowered it to 26. I put the cap on the prongs and my dog wasn't responding. I took the cap off the prongs and at level 26, my dog yelped like I have never heard yelped before. This device hurt my dog. I would not recommend this ecollar to anyone."
4204,3,"Sorry, but these don't hold much liquid at all. Furthermore, most ""chucks"" are scented slightly to draw animals to use them. These don't have this option and my pets won't use them. I spent more time cleaning up and purchasing enzyme remover- which ended up costing me a lot more in the long run by trying to save money with them. Hoping AMAZON will consider adding scent to these and making them thicker, stronger to actually capture urine instead of directing it to go in all directions creating a greater mess than any pad I've ever used in 23 years!: (."
4205,2,"So I came across these heavy duty training pads and thought they would work great for my two puppies. I have been using the Amazon Basics carbon puppy pads and liked those so I figured these would be even better.Spoiler alert, they were not. When I first opened the package I managed to tear the backing of one of the pads by barely catching it on my finger nail. I do not have sharp or long nails.The plastic backing is a little bit thicker and more rubbery than the regular pads from amazon and the filling is thicker.But, simply put, they do not work. Normally I'll leave 6 pads down for the dogs since they are inside for the day, normally those are more than enough and there are no issues with pee running off the pads or anything like that.With the ""heavy duty"" pads the pee just runs off the pad and goes EVERYWHERE. After half a day the pads are soaked both front and back and there is pee everywhere you don't want it to be.I'll go back to the carbon amazon basic pads - but buyer beware, these are only a heavy duty pain in the butt."
4206,1,"**UPDATE** They SUCK!I previously left this review ""I use these pads on the balcony so I don’t have to take the pup downstairs in the middle of the night. They are strong and hold a lot of fluid. After a heavy night of rain you see just how much they hold and still don’t tear under puppy claws""The supplier must have changed as these are now worthless and hold as much puppy pee as a sheet of newspaper. Ordered a new box and they came back just as bad. Judging by all the 1 star reviews, which seem to be hidden from the recent reviews, in the last few months I'd say something has changed with this product."
4207,3,"Update: i have now tried 2 other brands of pet training pads, and am very happy to say that neither of them have leaked. Only the Amazon pads leaked. (and i used more than one box of them)Original review: I have a cat that is urinating outside the litter box, and i use these pads to catch the urine. i have them positoned flat on the floor and also draped under the entrance to the litter box, under her entrance ramp. She is only 10 lbs and she urinates many times/day, so please note, this is not a large amount of urine, and it forms only a small to medium sized circle on the pad (it never fills the whole pad). My experience is that everything written in the product description is not true:- ""Each pad comes with five layers to ensure leak-proof performance."" My experience: these pads are super thin. I have examined them carefully and I don't see how they could have 5 layers.- ""The anti-streaming top layer offers a quick-drying quilted surface that locks in wetness, reduces odor, and prevents tracking."" My experience:when my cat urinates on the pads i drape around the litter box entrance, the urine runs off instead of being absorbed. When she urinates on the pad that is flat on the floor, it seeps through the plastic and gets the floor wet. If she steps on a urine soaked pad, she tracks it onto the floor.- ""The surge layer keeps liquid flowing in the right direction, while the sponge-like core provides maximum absorption and turns liquid into gel upon contact. "" This truly makes me laugh. There is no sponge-like core or gel action. The urine remains liquid, is not absorbed well by the pad, leaks out of the pad, and is easily tracked onto the floor when the cat steps on it.- "" The last two layers of the leak-proof pet-training pads--the locking layer and the protective plastic lining--keep floors safe from damage."" My experience is that they leak every single time."
4208,3,"These pads are horrible. I have a small dog, 15 lb. Chiweenie who is 9 years old. He has always used pads, as he is an indoors only dog. I have never had any problems with the brand I used to get at a big box pet store. I saw these on Amazon, and after having good results with the AmazonBasics dog waste bags, I thought I would give them a try since they were a great price. Well, let me tell you it was not worth it at all. Every single day we are cleaning up a giant mess of pee that has literally rolled off of the pad onto the tile floors. At first I thought that my dog was either getting old and a little senile, or just being defiant on purpose. Well, now I realize this is not the case after watching him go on the middle of the pad and it rolling right off. He is not that big to totally soak through this pad, and it seems like the pad doesn't really absorb anything. The liquid rolls right off the edge and under the pad as well. I believe my tile grout is permanently stained. Too bad my return window was just passed. These are going in the trash."
4209,3,"I rarely write reviews but I’ve never been so furious with a product. Wish I did more research, the pressure mounting aspect of the 4 corners means that this thing needs to be real tight to the frame, which wouldn’t be a problem for a doorway or something along those lines. I set mine up at the bottom of the steps, propped between the wall and the last vertical wood slat of my railing.First night the top corner that was positioned against the railing slipped off (round slat, kind of my fault but i figured out a solution). I will say that the other 3 corners remained intact so it's unlikely that it wouldn't have fallen on my kids had they been there when it happened.Day 2 my daughter was hanging on the gate and it opened, despite being locked, which likely was the result of the fact that it loosened my bannister from the stairs, which now appears to be structurally impaired.Adding insult to injury, when i took it down, upon loosening the pressure mounts, the gate smacked me in the face and then, after fully removing all 4 corners, the extension piece fell on my foot.My dog also didn't like this product. He would be real reluctant going up and down, probably the fact that the railing the extends across the bottom basically made the last step unusable for him so he would just skip it coming down and be real funny going up. He has some elbow arthritis though so probably not an issue for younger/smaller dogs but he's an 8 year old 75 lb lab. Would have to imagine some bigger breeds would be really challenged with the width of the opening too.To summarize, i don't recommend for steps at all, top or bottom, unless there's no railing in the picture. Probably a decent product in other settings and it felt very solid when it blasted me in the face. It's going back though and i'll just stick with my standalone gate for now."
4210,2,"I hate this gate. I find it amusing that the mother in the photo is smiling while holding her toddler in one hand and opening the gate with her free hand. WELL, let me please tell you that every time I have to open the gate I get angry, am not smiling and have to put my giant toddler down, on the stairs, while holding him between my legs to use all the muscles in both my hands to open the ridiculous latch. Really? Could they have made it any worse. It is like those adult proof straps on the new shopping carts, but much much worse.Seriously, just spend another 5 or 10 bucks and get a gate that you won't hate every time you see it. ( I ordered 3, but threw out the box and everything right after installing it so I had to keep one and returned the other 2. At least Amazon is super easy to return with.)."
4211,3,"Gate latch sticks and requires two hands to free it up. Latch mechanism is very much smaller than our older gate. Latch is cheap plastic parts riveted together so it cannot be disassembled for repair. This gate is really cheesy, looks like cost cutting backfired. Gate is being returned to Amazon for credit. Lower plastic stop that keeps gate from swinging past frame keeps falling out of position and allowing gate to swing 180 degrees. It is a very poor substitute for the welded stop on our old gate. This cost reduced gate is unsafe, I expect much better for a child safety item. It does not compare to our older gate from the same company.Updated, received a replacement from Amazon to replace the gate with the bad latch. The replacement had the larger latch and welded stop like our old gate. Looks like two different versions are being shipped."
4212,1,"This is a terrible gate - easily the worst I've ever had. I got it for my dogs and every aspect of the design is TERRIBLE. When uninstalled the gate constantly swings open. When installing it myself it swung open and smacked my wall causing damage. You'd need to zip tie it closed since for some crazy reason they don't design the gate to actually stay closed before installation..like every other suspension gate I've ever had. That fact alone is ridiculous. But, then you have the spindle rods. You'd think the threaded rods would actually screw into the gate...but they don't! The holes aren't threaded! So if you tilt the gate or try moving it around before installation they'll fall out. Seriously, who designed this piece of garbage?! Only the cheap plastic ""adjustment wheel"" is threaded so that is what holds the gate in. Very unstable design especially if you're at that sweet spot where you can't use extension gate piece and have to extend the rods further out. That's a disaster waiting to happen since the rod is just loosely sitting in the gate. I wouldn't trust this at ALL if you were buying it to keep a child from getting hurt. Last but DEFINITELY not least...who the heck wants to open this thing one handed? Seeing a review where a guy videoed himself opening and closing it was what sealed the deal for me buying this gate. Do not be fooled - it is very uncomfortable to open one handed or otherwise! I've got pretty strong hands but even my fingers were sore after trying to do it multiple times. Save yourself the headache and go with another gate. Whoever designed this had absolutely no consideration for anyone actually using it. It's like they cut every corner and straight up didn't care for the comfort of the person using or installing it."
4213,3,"This works for what it is, but the open entrance is a bit narrow (16 inches)... That's less than 1 and a half feet... Making it hard to walk through in general. I barely fit comfortably, some people had to walk through sideways... Debating on returning these or not...Installation is simple, and the gap between the lock and see does close as you tighten the screws (you will know what I mean when you first get it. There is also a piece of paper explaining this). One thing to keep in mind is if you have molding across the bottom of the walls, it may not stick on there properly.I purchased plastic covers for the ends to prevent damage on the walls. The ones it comes with seem cheap - made entirelyof plastic (see pic). Only thing you can use this for is to drill screws into it so that the gate will not move. This isn't for protecting your walls from damage."
4214,2,"I have a Maine-Coon cat. Sheds like a sheep-dog. I comb and brush him often. He does not fight or resist me when I brush and comb him. In fact he mostly enjoys it. I bought this brush (which is more like a razor comb) to add to my arsenal of grooming aids. To my surprise, when I tried this on my cat, he quickly resisted. I tried again a day or two later with the same negative response. And tried again after another week with same negative response. I found this to be strange because my cat enjoys being groomed. So, I decided to try it on my the back of my own head to see how it felt. Now I understand why may cat hates it. It just plain hurts. Drag it across your arm you’ll see. I threw it away."
4215,3,"I'll start by saying I got multiple emails from the seller requesting feedback and to email them if I have problems and I haven't emailed them because I want to leave honest feedback instead of being refunded in exchange for not saying something in the reviews. So seller seems motivated and I'm sure they'd refund me if I wanted it.That said, honest review- this doesn't work at all for my cat. It's nicer than a furminator as it doesn't feel like it's ripping hair out. My little gremlin didn't seem to mind it. But, it's just not effective. I get so much more off him with a slicker brush. My guy is an exotic shorthair- basically a short haired Persian. It grabs the undercoat as a comb like this should, but holds and removes very little hair. Slicker brush is way more effective. May work ok for other animal types but no good on my smooshy boy."
4216,3,"I had a similar brush with deeper teeth that worked real well on my cat with Real thick fur and the ones that are short haired. That brush had a wooden handle and the metal falls out of the wooden handle the first season of use. IF the handle of THIS brush was adjustable, I would like it much more. I got the other brush first and just got used to brushing from a straight down angle. This handle gets in the way. This brush also says ONLY USE on Shedding animals. I had to try it, it's new, but, I will use it more when they all start to shed. I ordered another brush of a different kind already, so, I will see how it works."
4217,2,"Did not find this worked well w/our dogs. We noticed some shedding lately even though our dogs are very short hair (2 pit bulls) so have been getting all over our clothes and furniture. its hard to keep up after 2 large dogs even w/ daily vacuuming so wanted some assistance in the shedding department. both sat still for the brush which is actually more like a comb but neither one really liked it. it did not do anything as far as hair removal so perhaps this is better or longer hair pets. we found better results w/the glove type hair removal areas used outside b/c while those do not catch the hair in the gloves w/short hair, they DO work at removal so being outside is helpful so that the hair does not get re deposited inside. have sent this item back. is prob better for long hair."
4218,3,"So I did the thing. I saw a much cheaper alternitive to the aussie grooming holy grail and I fell for it. I read the reviews, most of which were positive, but I should have noticed the lack of double coated dog owners. I ordered the ""long hair"" bursh but the teeth don't penetrate my aussies fur. In order to use this effectivly as a shedding brush I have to use a rake style brush and comb back the hair, parting it oposite the direction of growth and then let the hair come through the rake and brush it out in short strokes with this wannabe furminator. 10 minutes to groom is a pipe dream if your dog has thick fur or is double coated. I thought the first time was a one off because he was dirty. By the third time it was still taking me 30 minutes, and he is a mini! This brush does work well for my red heeler, so it gets two stars for not being a total waste of money, but pretty much every brush on the market works for my heeler so while it is a positive it is nowhere near a win."
4219,2,"We're not 100% sure, but it seems like this toothpaste poisoned our Yorkiepoo. The tube we got smelled rotten, but other reviews mention a bad smell too, so we used it a couple times and it seemed OK. Not a week later, our girl started throwing up and when we brought her to the vet the next day, she showed signs of terminal organ failure and she died. NOTHING else changed with her diet prior and she's always inside with us in the same place for years with no toxic items anywhere. She's not one to eat or chew anything besides her food and toys. We tried contacting Petrodex numerous time to simply ask if they knew of a bad batch or if their formula changed and we didn't even get a response. Very disappointed in this company and we will never buy their products again.Update 1/11/18 -- After numerous attempts to contact Petrodex with questions, we've gotten zero responses. Very unprofessional."
4220,1,I bought this last year I did not use it until spring of this year.I used it for a few weeks and it seemed to get a bad odor so of course I stopped using it and called the company.I could not read the expiration but it seemed to say 2020-the company was useless they said that since I didn't have the box there was no refund.I dont keep the boxes on my own toothpaste why would I keep the dog toothpaste box?It was stored in a cabinet and the brush rinsed after every use .I think it just turned but I must say since we switched to another brand my dog has had no stomach issues which he seemed to with this product in retrospect .Bad customer service and not a product I would trust.
4221,3,"If I could give this item 0 stars I would, but Amazon requires at least one star. We tried this out on our dog yesterday after dinner. We didn't use that much and followed all instructions. Since it was the first time, we used not even a pea-sized drop and brushed a few teeth on the top so she could get iaed to it. Around 2:00 am our dog was up and running around with explosive diarrhea. Of course, she ran over to our brand new $800 rug that we've only had for two weeks and let loose on that.It's ruined. Nothing else in her routine changed the previous day and she hadnt eaten anything new, so it had to be this toothpaste. I looked at the box and the first ingredient is sorbitol. When reading about this ingredient, it's not dangerous to dogs like xylitol is, but it can cause diarrhea, flatulence and runny stools in dogs. There is no warning regarding possible diarrhea on the box or tube packaging.As I was trying to get the stains out of our new rug, I browsed around online and saw this was complaint others had made for this toothpaste. How can this company market this as being safe for dogs when it upsets a dog's tummy so badly? I think Amazon should stop selling this as it's clearly unsafe and/or the product does not give approrlpriate warnings. And it would be appropriate for the manufacturer to reach out to me regarding my ruined rug. Of course I understand accidents happen and I take that on as a pet owner. But had there been approproiate warnings like ""May cause stomach upset in some dogs,"" I would have taken more precautions when trying this product out on her. Bit without being informed of this risk, the onis goes to this company."
4222,3,My dogs and I both used to love this toothpaste but something has changed in the last few months and it now smells like it's rotten. I bought three tubes and thinking maybe something was wrong with the first one I opened a second one. It smelled just as bad as the first. I then went to my local pet store and bought a smaller size tube of the same flavor (poultry) and it smelled bad like the rest. We had a tiny bit left in the tube we had been using so we did a taste test with our dogs and found they preferred the older tubes flavor over the new stinkier tubes. I went ahead and used the first tube because I needed something to brush my dogs teeth with but they aren't as excited about it as they used to be and towards the end of the tube it began smelling even worse. At this point my husband and I are concerned about the safety of this product for our two dachshunds and are looking into some other brands. I might also try to contact Sentry to make a complaint about this product as something is clearly wrong with it.
4223,3,"This product is not able to be returned. Do NOT buy this unless you know your dog likes the taste. I have 7 dogs to brush.... and NOT ONE OF THEM liked this product. I'm not fighting 7 dogs every day to brush their teeth. I have never had a bad experienced with amazon or any of it's sellers, but I just received this today and I'm not able to initiate a return.When I say they didn't like it, I don't mean they walked away from me.... I mean they took a taste of it then backed away in panic and started shaking their heads as if I just squirted hot sauce in their mouths. And this reaction was from only half a pea-sized portion in a 55# pit bull (and of course the others are smaller and had the same reaction.)The one star is for the customer service, not for the toothpaste. If the seller rectifies this issue, I will gladly amend the review."
4224,1,"Extremely upset and disappointed with this brush. The product description says all hair types but clearly this is not true. My dogs have short coarse hair and I thought it would be good to use to prevent excessive shedding in the house. I was very wrong. Apart from barely taking off any fur, this brush scratched my dog’s skin, leaving tiny abrasions under his fur that were bleeding. The bristles are very sharp and inflexible wires. I was very gentle and cautious, realizing this ahead of time, and brushed very gently. When I realized after about 5 strokes that my dog wasn’t enjoying it, I stopped and examined his skin. My dogs do not have sensitive skin, and I feel there is no excuse for this. A brush should not make your dog bleed. I’m so upset by this. Do not buy this brush!"
4225,1,"This is one of the worst products I have ever purchased from Amazon! Maybe I just got a dud maybe not. It’s easy to make the bristles come out with the button but retracting them is a pain, to say the least! I finally had to hit the brush on a hard surface to get them to retract. Every time I tried ( about 8 times<U+0001F974><U+0001F974><U+0001F974>) I had to strike the brush to get them to retract. I read all the reviews and watched the vid before ordering. Hate this piece of junk, don’t waste you money, even if it’s on sale. My Westie hated it too."
4226,3,"I have a white cat. While she is not technically a long-haired cat, she has a thick coat with hairs longer than my previous cats'. She has finally discovered the satisfaction of being a lapcat! Unfortunately, after each cuddle the front of my garments publicizes our activity. Regular brushing does help some and I hoped the Hertzko Self Cleaning Slicker Brush would create even better results.Unfortunately my hands are not strong enough to control the button on the brush. My fingers kept slipping off the button at the wrong time. Either I could not brush out any hair or, when my fingers slipped off the button, the hairs would begin falling out of the bristle area before I could drop them in the wastebasket I kept at my side.I have better success with the simple wire brush I have used in the past. I would like to return the Hertzko Self Cleaning Slicker Brush."
4227,2,"This slicker is very hard. This type of slicker is only for triple coated dogs that are blowing their coats. It can't or shouldn't be used for breeds and dogs with thin coats. I purchased this to use for dogs I'm grooming and giving hair cuts too. I liked the idea on being able to clean it with one hand. However, once it arrived I found this brush to be very hard. The hardness of the bristles will hurt the dogs, giving them want we call brush burn. Thays when the dogs skin becimes red, irritated and scratched. I planed on returning the product through prime. I responded to the email the company sent me asking for feed back on the product. The first response email I received from my reply was them telling me it won't hurt them, to which I informed them I've groomed for many years so I do know that it will. The person responded back telling me to brush the dogs gently. That's how I brush dogs. Even a soft slicker can injure their skin when used without care. Which all of their condensending responses weren't needed as I told them I was returning it and why from the beginning. I only bothered to email them in the first place about it because they asked for product feed back to help improve their product. The entire process of buying this and then dealing with the company had been terrible. I will be sure not to deal with this company again."
4228,3,"I have a medium hair dog with a thick (but not double) coat. After lightly using this brush on her, she ran away from me bc the bristles hurt her. This would be great for a dog with a double coat but is not effective on short and medium single coat dogs!!! If the description did not advertise this as good for short and medium hair dogs then I wouldn’t have given this a bad review.Also, I received an auto generated email from the company asking for feedback. So I sent them my feedback. No reply but then next week I got a follow up email from the company asking for my feedback. Not impressed, made me feel like I wasted time giving them feedback which they obviously did not value."
4229,2,"I have a little dog, part Chihuahua and part Jack Russell. In between hair cuts, it is difficult to clip his nails. They get very long. He has one nail that is completely black and I only cut the very tip. Back to the Boshel trimmers: My mother and I cut Max's nails together due to the hair around his nails. It too approx. 5 minutes to cut his nails. We are starting out small, a little at a time. The first time we cut my dog's nails they came out very well. The second time was horrible. I cut one of his nails too short. He was bleeding badly. I should take a picture of his nail but I don't want to upset him anymore. Returning these trimmers and only having his nails done professionally from now on."
4230,1,"The mechanism on these clippers are awful; squeezing them is way harder than they should be and there is a lot of rough friction as they are coming together. They then stay closed and do not spring open...you must pry them apart with both hands. These are by no means my first pair of dog nail clippers...but they are definitely the worst I have purchased. Though they look nice, they are VERY poorly made. I would expect a Dollar Store dog nail clipper to perform better than these! These were a total waste of money and I definitely do not recommend!"
4231,1,"I have dropped my star rating on this by 1 star. I was clipping my younger huskies nails today and while it clipper her dew claws with no issue. I started to clip her paw nails, even when using the guard it drew blood on 2 nails which I quickly stopped. Looks like I will be going back to using a sanding drum type tool for maintaining my pups nails. I am not going to put her through the pain and suffering. Sure she hates the vibration of the sanding drum but it no where is equal, to the pain she seemed to experience using the clippers.I will likely be using the clipper to keep her dew claws trimmed but not her paw nails.I do not feel as if I could recommend these to anyone else. I am a dog person and would never want my pet to bleed or go through the pain.Still not entirely wasted money but, if I had to purchase them outright I would not do so.It's an alright set of clippers, my older dogs are more use to me using a grinder type tool. This set of clippers is ok, I was able to clip a few of my younger dogs with no issue. But I find some of them (older dogs) have very tough nails and this wants to crack them. I am not 100% sold on them for those older ones. However this fit into my grooming routine with the younger dogs. So no money wasted."
4232,3,"I purchased these clippers after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately, we have not had a good experience with these clippers and have purchased a different brand because of how poorly they do their job. From the very first trim I would have to apply quite a bit of force to actually cut the nail (which results in a much slower, more nerve-wracking experience for both me and my dog), and the nail often seemed crushed rather than cleanly clipped. The clippers are large and awkward to handle, and the blade seems pretty dull. Not sure if my set was just a dud, but they definitely weren't worth the amount of money we paid for them."
4233,3,"I was very unsatisfied. They are on the pricey side and was hoping for good quality. The worst part and most important when purchasing nail clippers is having a sharp blade. We don’t want to make our furry friends uncomfortable or possibly even hurt them in an already awkward process. As quick and painless as possible is ideal. Unfortunately this product doesn’t meet the standards. I threw mine away after attempting to clip my 60 lb. dogs nails, who normally doesn’t mind the process. He was not a fan. I moved on to my mini schnauzer who weirdly enjoys being groomed (she’s a bit of a princess). The initial excitement of some quality grooming time quickly faded after the first clip. The clippers just aren’t fluid or sharp enough to clip even smaller dogs nails."
4234,1,"-Removes approximately 85-90% of pet hair on clothes and upholstery-Easy and quick to use-Hair collector is easy to clean out- After about a month, dust and hair got trapped over one side of the velvet and it is now less effective- The button to open the hair collector opens very easily and is located exactly where your hand would slide as you’re using the roller, which then dumps all this hair and dust onto whatever you were cleaning-The back and forth motion and friction is tiring, especially when doing bigger pieces- Roller head is not agile, making it difficult to remove pet hair from and nooks and ridges such as collars or sleevesBOTTOM LINE: works better than a lint roller but still leaves hair behind. For the price, you could do better with a pet hair handheld vacuum"
4235,3,"I had high hopes from the many praises I saw of this device but when I got it and we tried in my wife's Kia, she said it was only so-so at getting the hair out, and she didn't have a lot. I figured she was crazy and kept it a bit longer until I could try my Honda and go after the large quantities of dog hair in my back seat. Man was i disappointed. It was not getting the bulk of it, only the stuff that really sat on top and even that took repeated effort to get it out. So i returned it. Plus side is it's easy to clean and return."
4236,1,"One side works like magic the other doesn’t work at all.. so your basically paying to use one side since the other side doesn’t actually get used. Unless I was given a faulty product but too lazy to return it and already used the one side. Also difficult to clean I won’t be able to use it more than three or four times since getting lint or cat hair out is not as easy as all the other reviews are making it sound.
Wouldn’t recommend product."
4237,3,"I wanted this to work so badly! It didn't work at all on my cotton twill couch. I got a workout while trying and trying to repeatedly go over the cushions with the Chom Chom, but the dog hairs stayed stuck to the couch (a few came up, but not enough to really see a difference).The Chom Chom worked much better on my car upholstery that's a little more velvety/micro-fiber-y... maybe that's what people like it for?I wish I could get my money back."
4238,3,So I have a chihuahua dachshund mix and he sheds like no tomorrow. This thing worked but didn’t work. So at first it was picking up the hair but after a few times rolling it it didn’t really work. It’s not worth $25 a lint roller or tape would be faster yes cost more later but people with dog hair don’t want to spend 30mins get a little bit of hair up. It pushes the hair more than it picks it up.
4239,2,"We've had a cheap, old fashioned wooden baby gate for about 6 yrs but it's on it's last legs. Use it to keep the dogs in the bedroom at night. My Boston got excited one time when we weren't home and he was stuck in the bedroom and kind of charged it and splintered some of the wood. I paid $8 for it at WalMart! Decided to replace it with this newer version and what a mistake. Out of the box we couldn't get it to expand, spent about 30 minutes trying to get it to do that. Finally got it to expand and put it in the doorway. Good so far. Then we went to take it down, pulling the lever out to disengage the lock resulted in the lever snapping off the gate!! Guess I'm going back to old school, simple wooden gate with a notched lever."
4240,1,"First off, I read so many good/bad reviews on this product and figured it can’t be that hard to setup a dog gate inside the house as I’ve had one before and the reason I purchased this one was because of the reviews and price, but lesson learned, you get what you pay for.The quality of the plastic is not thick or durable, so it feels pretty flimsy and cheap. The locking mechanism is not smooth at all and you actually have to apply force to get it to lock. The locking part of it will only securely lock if you align the handle in the middle hole (there’s 3). Doing so caused a piece in the back to break. Also, when I had it setup, it doesn’t stay straight, still. It’s wobbly and curves (see photos). I’m returning this product and purchasing a strong, wooden one again. I do not recommend this plastic product for your pets."
4241,1,"My husband purchased two of these gates. This product can cause finger injuries when trying to expand the gate. DO NOT put your fingers in any of the holes!! You must hold the ends while expanding the gate to fit the doorway or you may come up bleeding!This product is hard to open to begin with, but trying to press the lever to lock it is a beast, especially if you have floor molding. If you have molding you will not get this gate flush to the floor, there will be a gap the same height as the molding, in my case about 6 inches.. enough for a small puppy to get under. I would have returned these gates but my puppy came early and I am now stuck struggling trying to get these gates up everyday. I would not recommend."
4242,3,"Nothing I do gets the gate to open, and what looks like directions that presumably explain how to open it are locked INSIDE the gate where I cant get to them. Guess I'm supposed to be a clairvoyant, but unfortunately, my crystal ball is in the shop (LOL!). I watched the demonstration video on Amazon...the gate still won't open. If it operates the way it shows on the video then they also put the warning sticker on upside down too. I don't care how good or bad a product is after I get it working (haven't got to the working part yet), if it has crappy or no instructions, it gets a 1 star review because that annoys the $h*t out of me. Seriously...that chaps my behind."
4243,3,"My four-month old Cocker Spaniel puppy was able to escape by climbing over the gate, since it has the cross-hatch pattern. I'm going to get a gate that only have vertical bars, instead. Also, it didn't fit with the floorboards, since it needs to grip an even surface at the top and bottom. The puppy was able to squeeze under the gate when I had it above the floorboards. However, if you don't think you'll have these issues, it is an economical gate that is sturdy when installed correctly."
4244,1,"The quality of the toys seemed fine. They arrived quickly, and they're pretty cute! However, I ignored the reviews that said their dogs had eaten the toy completely. My GSD has never eaten a toy, so I didn't think it applied to my household. Lo and behold, the first evening we gave him one, my husband had to rush our big baby to the emergency vet. He had swallowed it whole. Luckily, the ER team got him to vomit quickly, so crisis averted. I don't know if it's because these toys are relatively thin, but I really wouldn't recommend them to owners with large dogs. They're probably fine for canines where it is physically impossible for the toy to be accidentally swallowed whole."
4245,1,"3 skinny pets for this price was amazing-they are very cute! The material though is very very thin and if you have a pet that likes to chew the squeaky then the material is going to rip very quickly and then you have to get the squeaky out so it's not a choking hazard. I was really excited to get these but as they say you get what you pay for. Had for one day and had to remove all the squeakers from the pet and they still have the pet (holes included from where the material ripped). Plus side to this is there is no stuffing! Sadly, I really can't recommend with a clear conscious. If only the material was a bit thicker this review would be completely different."
4246,1,"I can't believe anyone would rate these higher than a 1. I have a small, 10 pound 6 month old puppy. I gave her one of these. She had it destroyed in 6 minutes. These might be good for aged dogs who have lost their teeth, or declawed cats, or pet rabbits, or I don't know? wall art maybe, haha....but they are NOT good for puppies or dogs. Don't buy them! You are wasting your money. Plus, you can't return them. WORST PRODUCT PURCHASED FROM AMAZON IN 4 YEARS. Amazon: love your site! Please don't stock crappy items like this though, because it makes me less inclined to trust you as a company I can rely on."
4247,3,If you have a large dog supervision is key with this product. My dog loves socks so I figured this was a great thing and had sqweekers double great. However while unpacking my amazon boxes the toy had disappeared this all happened in the same room. Very concerned I looked everywhere. I had a feeling she had eaten it. She is 8 and loves socks and has never swollen one! Brought her to the vet they tried to induce vomiting half the toy came up. The other half was in there. She had swollen the toy. They preformed and endoscopy and if that didn’t work would have to do surgery. Anyways this $9 toy turned into a $8000 nightmare.
4248,3,"I see that the reviews for these are great, so maybe I recieved a defective batch, but I can only comment on my experience.My dog isn’t an aggressive chewer. She’s over a year old and has the same toys since she was 8 weeks old, with no damage other than slight wear to them.The first of these toys didn’t last half an hour with her. She enjoyed it very much obviously, but it fell apart instantly.I’ve attached a photo of this toy after 30 minutes next to an extremely similar toy she’s had for a full year."
4249,1,"This was garbage. Packaging was not good, product box had popped open, light was just rolling around in its product box. It felt cheap and flimsy. I took it to where I know there is urine on carpet, nothing. Darkened my entire home and tried to find spots, nothing showed. I finally was able to detect a little bit of urine on the toilet but it required me to get up close and squint. The entire beam was so incredibly weak you could only look at a few inches at a time and only in pure darkness like a bathroom. I immediately sent this back and ordered a Kobra brand for twice the price at $24. It showed up tonight, it felt solid and heavy and was packaged well. It specifically advertised that it works in ambient light, and it does. My entire house lit up like a Christmas tree. And you can tell the difference in the colors really well, green for urine, dark brown for blood, blue for cleaning agents. All showed up really easily, it works a little too well. I will be cleaning tomorrow. Please don’t order this, get the Kobra brand instead."
4250,3,"The product worked the first two times we tried it, within 2 months of purchase. We attempted to use it approximately three months after purchase and the LED lights had all died. I determined that by replacing all the batteries with fresh ones and the unit still did not work, Very disappointing, AND . . . there is no easy to locate site or phone number to get the issue resolved.FOLLOWUP - To Vanksytech's credit, they responded very quickly to my review that the product stopped working and have issues me a new Black Light Flashlight, at no charge. Thank you very much."
4251,2,"I bought this light after I found a spot in my dining room that one or more of our cats had been urinating on. We did not notice the spot right away, and it was clear the cats had used the spot a few times before we caught it. I ordered some Enzyme cleaner to treat our carpets and wood floors and added this UV urine detector light to ensure that we would not miss this if it happened again. I took this light first and shined it on the carpet that had been urinated on. The spots were all dry and the light did not illuminate them. I found this odd, but thought maybe the urine will only illuminate if it is wet. Still I scoured our house one night with all the lights off. I shined this light everywhere. In every dark corner where a cat could hide, I made sure there were no glowing urine spots with the light. Come to today, I found a fresh puddle of urine by my front door. I went and grabbed the light......NOTHING. The UV light made the grain in my wood floor stand out, but the cat urine did not react to the light at all. It may as well have been a puddle of water on the floor. This light is not the correct wavelength for detecting urine. So now I must attempt to find a light that will actually do the job. Lesson learned, don't trust the title of the item for sale. Read the reviews and do your homework before you purchase. I will be returning this if they allow me to."
4252,3,"First tip: UV wavelength MATTERS for cat urine! (Keep Reading)My cat peed on my new shag rug, and before I wanted to take a cleaner to it, I wanted to know exactly where to clean, so I bought this. I received it, waiting until night, turned off all the lights (yes the urine was totally dry). NOTHING SHOWS. I know there is pee on the carpet, because she smell is strong. This doesn't even glow a little bit. I'm so disappointed. It makes lint and white socks glow, but that's about it. It shows human urine and dog urine, but that doesn't help me much. It tested it on the litter box, it has a ever so slight green glow, but I'm not relying on that faint glow to detect pee for cleaning.After I've researched, cat urine should use a wavelength of 365-385!!! How can they fail to advise customers of this before they buy? This product is 395 and is too high to visibly show cat pee! Now I have to order a new one and wait even longer before I can properly clean my rug. I'm returning this."
4253,3,"This product is completely useless in detecting urine or much of anything else, other than making your whites look whiter and bright colors brighter. Everyone who is freaking out about your house hotels and seeing spots with this everywhere and such...take heart. It probably isn’t as bad as you think...at least not with this product, which will intensely illuminate plain water splashed from a faucet or sink that dried on the wall. I agree that hotels can be nasty and there are probably gross things lurking that you can’t detect with the naked eye...but this blacklight strongly highlights simple WATER droplets of any kind (and doesn’t highlight ANY urine that I can see - dog OR ESPECIALLY cat urine).I specifically tested it by splashing some droplets of plain water from my bathroom sink and let them dry on the wall. You couldn’t see them with the nekked eye, but the droplets lit up like a Christmas tree under this light with the lights out.My 18 year old cat peed on a bathroom rug, and this didn’t pick that up at all. Nothing."
4254,3,My dog is an extremely strong chewer and the only toy that he hasn't managed to destroy are the medium sized chuck it balls. They are a great alternative to regular tennis balls and much safer as they are made of a foam like rubber that doesn't crack as easily. Plus there is no felt held down by glue. I thought the X-L ball would be great as my dog is larger and I thought he might like chewing on the larger sized ball. Unfortunately within 30 mins it had already started tearing. I don't know if the larger size is to blame or if I just got a faulty product or what but either way it was very disappointing. That being said I will reiterate that the medium size has lasted almost a year and shows no sign of wearing out anytime soon. This is with a dog who can chew through an antler in a day might I add lol. My positive prior experience is why I have given this specific size more then one star.
4255,2,"I just purchased the Chuckit Ultra Ball large. It received over 5000 reviews, nearly all positive. I then happened to notice that the product was in Amazon’s “Today’s Deals.” I happen to peruse through more information about a dog ball than I’ve ever seen in my life and look what I literally find at the bottom of the exceedingly lengthy, ecstatic dog playing with the product description:“Important informationSafety Warning :Remove toy from use if it becomes destroyed or damagedDirections :n/aLegal Disclaimer :This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.“Are you kidding me? Outrageous! I have yet to see this description on any dog product I’ve ever purchased on Amazon and I’ve bought many. I shall be returning this product as soon as possible."
4256,2,"I have purchased this product for years. We have a small dog, she is not known to chew up her balls, but mainly carries them around with her in the dog park. I've noticed over the last six months this product seems to be manufactured to last less then a week. The balls have split open in the middle after just a few uses. At first I thought it was just a bad batch, but it's not, it's poor manufacturing. All packs I've ordered have fallen apart in a very short period of time. I am really annoyed by intentionally making a product on the cheap so that it falls apart quickly, then ends up in a land fill and more have to be purchased. This is the unsustainable business practices I just can't support. I'm done with this product until they can make it much sturdier then it is currently being manufactured. We never had an issue until recently, but this product no longer earns my money, or respect."
4257,2,"I'm sorry to say that a once untouchable product has changed for the worst. While the customer service department seems to still be in active and responsive as they were prompt in sending me a replacement set for the initial returned set.I took the replacement, in the off chance that it was only fluke that both balls in the 2 piece set were broken in less than 3-4 hours of ball play and chewing --- but just as I thought and as other reviews have mentioned- these balls are completely different from their old assembly line shipped out not more than 6 months ago.To give an idea of the disparaging change in the quality of this product, I still have all but maybe 3 individuals of the balls sets that I have purchased (2 times a year for the past 4 years). The 3 now absent, have merely been adopted into my friends ansfamikies dogs' homes, but they too are still in tact. years and years of adequate quality, durable enough for the regular demand of four large and active dog.These new sets of balls, on the other hand, seem to all pop the same routine circular holes in the bottom of the ball, time after time, after only a couple hours of obsessed chewing out of my 55 lb Shepherd mix. He is the smallest and also the least aggressive chewer in my dog family.Sad to say the one toy I was counting on buying in perpetuity, has changed for the worse.I will not be tryinG these again unless some signal has been clear from either multiple customers with revised reviews, and/or a real explanation of the disparity, from the seller/manufacturer."
4258,1,Don’t believe the hype these are expensive balls that last no longer than very cheap ones. My two dachshunds can rip these apart in less than an hour. The seams on the ball between the blue and orange spell the balls death. In there other two packs there is an orange and blue and a solid blue ball...For some reason the material this blue ball is made of is truly long lasting. I wish they would just sell the solid blue balls. The have a two pack of solid orange and blue but again for some reason the material the solid orange balls is made of leads to destruction in less than an hour. bottom line if you want a longer lasting ball buy the solid blue only dont waste money on the blue and orange.
4259,2,"I got this brush for my newly rescued German Shepherd. He sheds a great deal, so I thought a pre-emptive de-shedding tool would work wonders to keep my apartment clean and free of hairballs. I tried using this brush on my dog the day I got it in the mail. With the first stroke, my dog seemed very uncomfortable with the brush. As I continued, each successive stroke seemed to hurt him greatly. I figured that maybe it was just an adjustment issue, so I stopped using it that day and decided to introduce it to him slowly, and with lots of treats to encourage him to tolerate the tool. After a week of slow introduction, I have given up. Even despite my dog's reluctance, I noticed that it was also pulling his hair fairly often. Now, he doesn't have very long hair, nor is it matted at all, so this was troubling.This tool was terrible at serving the purpose I bought it for. My dog hated it so much that I decided to try ""brushing"" it up against my own skin, and sure enough, even the slightest stroke was painful. I can see why he was hesitant. When I did get to use it on him for a limited time, I didn't even notice that much hair coming off of him. I'll be trying returning this product and trying a less invasive brush on my puppy."
4260,3,"I have 3 ""no name"" brand deshedding dog brushes. They work great and I brush my dog easily 3 times a day. I never bought a furminator because of how expensive they were. So this one was a deal of the day so I bought it. I used it literally for 5 days, my dog appeared to be leaving more hair everywhere. I brushed her today with the brush, some hair came off but not a ton. I decided to grab my other brush, and the difference was night and day. The ""no name"" brand brush was clearly 100% better and taking so much more hair off. This brush literally could not be any worse and I am beyond disappointed. This brush has great reviews on amazon and on google. This brush is honestly terrible and was not worth the $13 I spent on it. I could not be more disappointed. This brush if for long hair dogs, I compare it to my other brushes and its shorter than the other ones. I really thought this was going to be the best brush, but clearly I have realized its useless."
4261,3,"This is inexpensive because it's not a real FURminator tool. It's a fake and it performs like one. I'm a big fan of the Furminator deshedding tool I do have and wanted to get a bigger one for our new Great Pyrenees adoptee and was hoping this great deal would save money compared to the one sold at one of the big pet stores which costs more than twice as much. But it didn't work nearly as well as the smaller one I already have, and you can tell from the blades that it's not the same quality as a real FURminator. It's in fact more like a FAILminator. Not worth the money. I returned it and the company did refund the full purchase price, so that is a mark in their favor!"
4262,1,"Buyer beware! I purchased this long hair ""FURminator"" from 'Valentina Vallenti US' through Amazon.com, turns out it is a counterfeit product! I have both the Long hair and Short hair deShedding brush that I have purchased at a chain pet store a few years ago so I decided to compare the both as the packaging looked poorly made. On closer examination I noticed that the blades looked extremely dirty, it almost looked like it was ""rusted"". My previous brushes that I've owned that I purchased for double the price at a chain pet store the metal comb still looks brand new despite the amount of brushing it goes through on my Australian Shepherd and Chihuahua. To make sure I wasn't completely overreacting, I went to the same chain pet store I purchased my previous brushes to compare the two through the packaging since I tossed out the packaging for my old brushes a long time ago and can only compare the brushes itself out of the packaging. Low and behold the packaging did in fact looked off compared to the one from the chain pet store. As one of the reviewers mentioned the picture of the dog laying on the rug on the packaging is extremely low in resolution. The packaging and font colors looked slightly different from the authentic FURminator brush and packaging. The plastic used on the counterfeit one looked much more poorly made and cheap. The brush cover for the brushes were also two completely differently colors. It's slightly concerning to know that I have purchased a counterfeit product. Thank goodness I did not use them on my pups, who knows if it would have ruined my Aussie or Chihuahua's coat! Or even worse it could've hurt them, especially with all that weird rusting going on in between the metal combs! I'm so glad I inspected it and also had the authentic combs to compare before using them on my babies. I would definitely be reaching out to FURminator to let them know about this incident and will also be returning this product."
4263,3,"If you have a dog with a thick coat such as a German Shepherd, Australian Shepherds, Husky, etc. don’t buy this. This is going to pull loose fur off that’s sitting on the top coat, it won’t do much for your dog’s undercoat. You’ll see by looking at the photos, the teeth of the Furminator’s comb aren’t long enough to get deep into the undercoat of your dog’s coat. Most of my dogs shedding was from the undercoat and not the overcoat. Get yourself a simple undercoat comb, like displayed in my photo. It’ll get down the lower coat and remove the shedding that’s probably all over your house. I used a Ferminator for a year until my local pet store laughed and told me to get an undercoat comb. It’s was $5.99 and it works much better on my Australian Shepherd than this Furminator.I would assume this also goes for long haired cats but I don’t have any experience there."
4264,3,"I don’t write reviews but this is ridiculous. I just received this product yesterday and let it charge overnight. On a quick side note: it does not state clearly on here that it comes with a charger so I purchased the “recommended accessory” separately and low and behold, now I have two. Strike one. After letting the battery charge for a good 24 hours before using, I started the job of trimming my three dogs nails. Dog one and dog two went well, very slow, but well. The speeds on this thing are too slow for my taste, however grooming dogs is part of my every day career so I don’t have the time nor the patience to use a Dremel this slow. Frankly neither do my dogs who were getting much more antsy than normal. Strike two. After finishing dog two I started on dog threes nails. Halfway through her nails the dremel slowed down significantly eventually to the point where I couldn’t put any pressure on the nail to grind it without the dremel coming to a complete stop. I couldn’t even completely finish her nails. Strike three. I used the dremel for less than 25 minutes and it couldn’t handle that? I was on the fence about this dremel in the first place and now I know that I should have dished out for a regular dremel and not these pet specific waste of money kind. Not a happy dog mom right now. I will be returning this thing if it doesn’t get tossed in the trash before I can make it to the mailbox.P.S. Storm aka dog three, gives this dremel two paws down!"
4265,3,"This tool is extremely dangerous and caused a serious incident after we used it for about a year without problems. One day while trimming my dog's nails, he swiped his tail into the tool and the hair immediately got wound up and it was nearly impossible to turn off the tool while preventing it from injuring my dog.In my opinion the Dremel company has been very greedy and irresponsible to market a power tool as a pet product with no modification other than adding a paw print image to the tool.We ended up buying a safer nail grinder that is actually designed for pets and has a cover to prevent the accident that occurred with the dremel. And I now use this ""Pet nail grooming tool"" for woodworking."
4266,2,"Having other Dremel rotary tools in my small shop which have performed very well for years, I bought this Dremel-branded rotary tool for nails and small, light polishing work. This was disappointing from the get-go. Tool was always noisy, with a metallic rattly sound that sounded like it was grinding itself to death. Two speeds, ""slow and slower"". Battery was always weak - even after being fully charged it would run the tool for, at most, about 15-20 minutes. Not much torque - would slow down significantly while doing normal doggy-paw nails. Over time, the battery would run the tool for fewer and fewer minutes, until it was under 2 minutes. I looked for replacement batteries, but brand-name batteries were almost as much as a new tool. Since this Dremel 7300 was disappointing from the start, I decided to chuck the whole thing - throw it out. I bought a corded WEN rotary tool as a replacement (WEN 2305 Rotary Tool Kit). I didn't want another under-performing battery-powered tool that locked me into high-priced tool-specific replacement battery. For other users a cord may not be an option; for me, a cord works OK. The WEN does everything this Dremel did, only better. This Dremel left a bad taste - if I didn't have other Dremels (one corded and one battery powered) that have performed well, I wouldn't buy another Dremel. I am putting this model down to an attempt to cash in on a name using a re-branded cheap generic tool."
4267,2,"I am very disappointed in this product. And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:-- its heavy-- its noisy - scares both my dogs. The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.-- battery charge didn't last long.Second, when it didn't run:-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall. It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times. I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"". Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing. No light, nada.So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?The answer was disappointing too. No idea. You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there. But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.Dang, hate wasting money."
4268,3,"Updated review 2/2016. This tool began having switch problems three months ago. I use it once a month on my mini-lasapoodle so that means I have used it about 16 to 18 times. After approximately 12 times the speed started getting inconsistent. Revving up and then down, then stopping then revving up, now it frightens my dog to use it. Cheap price, but quality not so good. My elderly father has a big dremmel tool that plugs in, which he purchased it probably over 30 years ago, which my sister inherited and still works. This version is not good in quality. The switch goes on and off during use, I have to hold the switch down to get the connection to try to keep the speed consistent. I didn't expect it to last 30 years like my elderly Dad's dremmel, but I didn't expect it to last through only 12 pedicures either. Wish I had bought the plug in Andis version.First review - purchased 12/20/2014: Very nice tool. I think I needed a rougher sand paper because one of my poodle's toenails are like steel. Be careful when you use it that you don't hold it more than a few seconds, because a Dremel heats up the toenail fast. I think this was a good purchase and would recommend you to purchase it. Perhaps including other sand paper grains from light to medium to heavy would be a nice add to make it 5 star. That way depending on what kind of toenail you are dealing with you don't need to immediately purchase another grade of sandpaper for the bit."
4269,2,"The daycare my dog goes to says they order their poop bags from Gorilla Supply (and they are SUPER thick and durable! The last poop bags I ordered I had to double to avoid accidentally touching poop because they were so frail). I went on Amazon and thought I was ordering the same bags as my dogs daycare but once they arrived I was really disappointed. They are the same thickness as the ones I'm DOUBLING now!! I sent them back, theres no use in having to use 2 bags 2-3 a day; which completely beats trying to be cost effective. The search continues for a sturdy poo bag. :("
4270,1,"It doesn't have the spool in the middle so I can't use with my old poop bag holders. The self tearing seems cool in the beginning but when the roll gets smaller, the bag disappears back into the holder and you have to keep opening it up to get the bag out. Absolutely frustrating and inconvenient! You need to change the design of the bag holder and add in the spool! I have a few leashes and they all have poop bag holders...what do I do with the other holders now? Total waste of money!"
4271,1,"What a great idea. 1000 poop bags, and a dispenser. Attaches to a leash, that's just awesome! The issue is the dispenser broke after the second roll was installed. I contacted gorilla to purchase more dispensers and offered to buy 3-5 knowing i can expect them to break in short order. They did respond same day and said that i can get a new dispenser when i buy more bags. I don't need more bags. I can't recommend this product due to poor quality, and the inability to just order what we need."
4272,2,"We've used about 8 rolls of these so far and all were fine, but then I grabbed a new roll from the box and came to realize, when picking up my dogs waste, the bag had no closed end and fell out the other side when I went to tie it. I thought, oh ok a defective one, but nope I got another and another and they are all unsealed. The whole roll is defective and none of the bags are sealed on one end. They are all opened on both sides!! I hope the rest of the box of bags aren't like this, but I'm not buying from this brand again."
4273,2,"I have tried them for a week and I hate them. They are thick enough, the dispenser is my favorite, and I thought they would be wonderful, but these are so short that by the time you ""fill"" them there is hardly enough room to tie a knot. I don't know how a person with big dog poops to clean up would even get it closed. It's amazing how much of a difference that an inch or two makes. Plus, if you just put a couple in your pocket and then take one out - it is amazingly difficult to see which end opens. These are only the second bags I have tried with my puppy. The first were much longer and easier to use so maybe I got spoiled. I feel like I totally wasted my money."
4274,1,"My dog has bad breath and I was looking for a good and reliable toothpaste to clean his teeth, I got this product and used it on my French bulldog and within a couple hours he started having head tremors, immediately rushed him to the emergency vet. They had no idea what it was from, asked if I changed his diet and what not or if he got into anything and I couldn’t think of anything because I’m like no possible way he got into anything because I was with him the whole day and no possible way it was this new tooth paste I got him because it even says vet recommended ! All lies, immediately threw the toothpaste away and his head tremors stopped and haven’t occurred since. So the vet and I are both convinced that it was because of this toothpaste. So if you use this, be careful and keep an eye on your dog !"
4275,3,"Even though this product had good reviews, I did not like. Or should I say my dog did not like the flavor I think because she just refuses to let me brush her teeth. Also, the toothbrush is big for her mouth and it is hard to her teeth aligned right between the three angles of the brush. She won't even let me get in her mouth. :( So, in other words, this was a total waste of money for me. My dog is a bichon frise (22 lbs). She is fine when I brush her teeth with a regular brush and another toothpaste brand. So I am going back to basics."
4276,3,"I thought the toothpaste would be great because the ingredients in them are probably as good as you can get for pet toothpaste. I received the tube version and the toothpaste came out without any issues. The toothpaste itself is a soft cream type consistency, not sticky or very runny. It stayed on the toothbrush with no problem. From a human standpoint, the smell was light and not too strong. To me, it smells similar to bananas. My dogs are used to toothbrushing from a very young age and have no problems opening their mouths and allowing me to brush them. Unfortunately, all 4 of my dogs hated it. Usually, they have little aversion to anything that resembles food, but, as soon as they took a sniff of it, each one closed their mouths and turned their head away. As I said before, it smells similar to bananas, so, I thought my dogs would like it since they love bananas and eat them often. I tried putting on even a smaller amount (less than pea size) and they still reacted the same way. I really wanted to like the toothpaste, but, since all of my dogs hated it, I will have to throw this one out."
4277,1,"Buyer beware! I ordered this item and reviewed the ingredients/made in information as soon as it arrived. Two BIG problems: 1) The toothpaste contains baking soda, which means it's not dog safe. If you're comfortable using it anyway, go for it... But I don't see a good reason to use a risky toothpaste on my pup when there are many baking soda free options out there. 2) IT'S NOT MADE IN THE USA. The toothpaste is made in the US, which is probably why they can get away with the false advertising, but the toothbrush is made in China (per the packaging). Sad because this would've been a good find, but after reading the package, it's going in the trash."
4278,1,"I purchased this toothpaste and brush for both my sisters dog and my own (both large lab mixes). In my experience I found the toothbrush to be a piece of garbage. This may be because my dog is large, however I dont think the size should effect wether or not the tooth brush causes the dogs gums to bleed. After about 25 seconds of brushing i noticed small abrasions near the gum line at the bottom of my dogs large back molars. I was not agressively brushing, but my dog did chew the brush slightly. I cannot say anything bad about the toothpaste, from what I understand it is very good for your dogs oral health. But, if you purchase this product you may want to look into getting a different toothbrush, especially if you have a larger dog."
4279,3,"My dogs love this size & design. However, I have noticed that after a few chews with the Nylabone chew toys, the dogs will get gagging on the sharp splinter type of material that they are made out of. We can only let our dogs chew on these when they are new. Then we have to throw them away. When our most avid chewer gets a hold of anything Nylabone, we have to take it away from her because of her gagging by getting pieces in her mouth & possibly down her throat. We have also had to throw them out after seeing their gums bleed after they get any wear. I truly wish Nylabone would fix this problem. Because our dogs really do love their products. It's the splintering of the material that is the problem which makes them useless fairly quickly! Our 40lb English Bulldog is an avid chewer. So, just keep an eye out on your dogs when they are chewing on these. And if you hear any gagging throw them away!"
4280,2,"I find Nylabone products to be a moving target. Some are as hard as rocks which my dogs love and last for months. Others, and I'm not talking about puppy products vs. big dog products, last for anywhere from days to weeks.If you try to make sense out of their website vs. what you can find online or in pet stores it will be challenging to figure out exactly what you are getting. I contacted their customer support and reported that products with the same description performed differently and even varied in color. I threw out the ones that crumbled into big chunks that I was worried could harm my dog's digestive tract. Nylabone would not admit to any changes and said they wanted me to send them samples, which I couldn't do since I threw their products away.I'm beginning to think they have a premium product line for pet stores and a lesser quality for online retailers."
4281,1,"Love these so far! Have a bully that lives to chew. So far, he is very pleased with this ring and it's pretty okay for tug of war as well. These seem like they will last a while. They're very thick and seem to be well made. As long as the babe is happy, I am too.Update - we came home today to find our second dog, a beagle lab mix, chewing one of these. We heard a snap noise and looked down to find him looking confused. The dog toy was fine, but looking next to it we found a piece of molar tooth. This bone snapped our dogs tooth IN HALF! I don't know whether it was the design, the construction, or how our dog approached chewing on this bone particularly, but we have never had any issue with other bones in his whole entire life. Now we need to have dental surgery done on him due to this toy. I cannot recommend this product at all - in fact, at this point I'd recommend you avoid it AT ALL COSTS!!"
4282,3,"I have a 12 year old Husky/Pit mix and an 18 month old Pittie I adopted from my local animal shelter recently. The Pittie is VERY mouthy (had been kept chained to a tree and never taught any manners before arriving at the shelter) so I've purchased quite a few toys (mainly of the ""stuff-able"" variety) to help keep him (and my old boy) occupied until he is better trained. Both dogs are over 60 lbs so I need tough toys that can withstand big jaws chomping on them. This toy seems to be made of very durable material. However, NEITHER of my dogs are interested in this ring AT ALL. Which I find both surprising and disappointing. Thankfully, it didn't cost much, but my hope is that, someday, they'll appreciate this toy like they do the others. So far though, they couldn't care less about it. :("
4283,3,"We have a big dog and he's an aggressive chewer. I eagerly bought this for him and the minute I gave it to him, he grabbed it and within 2 seconds he threw it across the room, saying what the heck is this?! So I picked it up and brought it over to him and this time, he would turn his head left and right, saying I refuse to play with this toy. He just left it there and ignored it completely. Based on all the great reviews, I was excited to get him this, and he just never took interest in it. It's funny what some pets will love and others they just won't be interested. This seems to be a decent toy, our dog just never took any interest in it."
4284,2,"These use to be great. They were large, absorbent and didn't leak. That is no longer the case.I don't know if they are having problems with a batch or if they have cut corners because the product is now mediocre at best. The last 3 boxes I have bought I have noticed the padding were thinner than before and the plastic barrier now leaks. If a puppy pad leaks, I think that is a fundamental flaw in the design and it is no longer working for it's sole purpose.Too bad. Another great product that is now crap. I hope the corner cutting was worth losing everyone's business.I am now on the hunt for a something better."
4285,2,"Initially I thought these were great, mostly because my dog's accidents had been of the number two kind, but he just had a few of the number one accidents. The first time, the urine went through and our hardwood floor was soaked. Because it appears to have a plastic backing, I figured that maybe somehow, the urine had just gotten around the padding. The second time my dog had a number one accident, however, I made sure to see if it was possible the urine could have leaked off or around the padding, but because the urine was all in the middle of the pad with no wetness towards the edges, I thought that I was good. But as soon as I lifted the pad I noticed my floor was once again soaking wet (not damp, but as if this pad did nothing but just transfer the urine). This was exactly in the same spot underneath where the urine was on the pad. So in fact, the urine had soaked through this. Now we have a cardboard box and newspaper underneath these pads, but once we go through this box, I will be trying a different brand."
4286,2,"I used to be a huge fan of these until the past few weeks. Although they serve a purpose, they can be really dangerous. My dog started chewing and eating the blue part when I wasn’t home. There needs to be a better way to make these, and not be able to rip. Dog owners, if your dog eats this, it can lead to an obstruction, which can be deadly. I ended up at the vet this week getting x-rays after my dog started vomiting blue plastic two days later. After googling it online, this is a far too common issue. I’m looking into the washable ones, or other alternatives. I’m giving it two stars just because it’s good when it’s an emergency and you can watch your dog like a hawk!"
4287,3,"The pads are much thinner than I expected. For training puppies, I think the pads would be quite effective. For 'accidents' by mature large breeds, the pads are better than nothing.I've been trying these out, hoping for something disposable, but will probably go back to using the blue and white quilted cloth bed/mattress pads. While those pads are a pain, they work.In my opinion, the description of this product should have been specific about its efficacy with regard to mishaps by mature dogs. These may be fine for a mature small dog.....not so hot for a German Shepherd.UPDATE: Recently bought  HYPERLINK ""https://www.amazon.com/McKesson-StayDry-Ultra-Underpads-30-x36-100-Case/dp/B00BE5D2FA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"" McKesson StayDry Ultra Underpads, 30""x36"", 100/Case. My 120# German Shepherd had a rare accident (he's old) the very first night. He even dug in and scratched. No tears...the pad was impervious and it worked perfectly. This is the pad I'd recommend for large breeds."
4288,3,"I've been buying these pads (x-large) for over a year now and I love them. They are pricey but we'll worth it. I keep folding the pee spots until there's no more room to do so. I have an 8 yr old maltese weighing 8 lbs. Each pad takes over 6 trips before it gets disposed. They are well made, thick and absorbant. I will keep buying these. I hope they never get discontinued or more expensive.The quality has gone down. These pads used to be so much thicker and absorbent. But since about 6 months ago, they have turned paper thin and the edges split open. Terrible. As you can read in my old review with a 5 star, these pads used to be very thick and durable. Unfortunately the quality of everything these days keeps going down and prices keep going up. It's very unfortunate!"
4289,3,"My 45 lb dog was right on the border of the medium and large sizes when I measured her. I first tried medium, not wanting the harness to be too large but it would not buckle around her at all so I then got the large. When it is tightened as far as it can go, it is too big and slides around when trying to use the front hook, defeating the purpose. I reached out to the company and sent pictures but they kept telling me to try tightening it more (even though my pictures showed that it was completely tightened and could go no further). So now I have a useless harness that is too big and doesn't prevent pulling at all. While the quality seems good on the harness, if your dog is on the border of 2 sizes, you may want to find another brand that will fit better and from a company that will do more to help when the size isn't correct."
4290,2,"My dog is 66lb heeler/lab-pit mix and can pull hard when she's overly anxious or excited. After a little over a week, the top hook material started fraying and the fabric seems weak. Also, even though the harness was as tight as it could be around my dog, without cutting into her skin, she was able to pull back and wriggle loose, OUT of the harness! I noticed that as she walks, the side straps loosen and we have to keep tightening them constantly.When adjusted, the reflective material disappears inside of the actual harness (so, it's not visible when on my dog's body.)Overall, I do not feel this is a safe harness for my dog, especially when the fabric is week, the straps loosen, the reflective material doesn't even show and my dog is able to houdini her way out of it!I contacted the company right away and they asked for these pictures and a description of my dog, which I provided, but never heard back. Either we received a defective product OR this harness really is UNSAFE....I just tried following up with them again, so... we'll see if they have anything to say... for now, I'm back on the market for a much better, Safe & Secure harness...."
4291,3,"I have a 120 pound Mastiff and was looking for a product to keep him from dragging me around whenever I walked him. I originally tried the Gentle Leader. but he hated having it around his mouth and it was a battle every time I had to put it on him. Someone told me about the Easy Walk Harness and when I was researching came across this product. I was really impressed with the reviews so decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, it only inhibited pulling slightly and although I watched a video to make sure I adjusted it correctly, it would shift and just spin around on my dog's body when he would dart and pull. I truly wanted this product to work but sadly it did not."
4292,1,"I purchased this harness less than two months ago. The inside of the neck opening ripped. It was held together by glue. The rubbing of the sharp glue and ripped material resulted in a large gash on my dog’s neck.I thought my 25 pound boston terrier, Mitch, did not want to go on walks anymore. I assumed he was feeling lazy or would rather play fetch at home. However, I noticed a huge gash on his neck. Surely enough, I checked his harness and realized the broken, cheap material was rubbing and cutting his neck during our walks. No wonder he did not want to put this harness on. Please beware and do not buy this harness."
4293,1,"This harness is not as helpful as advertised. If you have a strong pulling dog, the harness does not deter or curb pulling at all. The best fix for this is training for the owner and the dog. I would have no problem with this harness in terms of comfort and look to use when hiking or daily walking if it were not advertised as a helpful product. Shame on me though - I fell for it. The company wouldn't consider a return. Instead they encouraged me to fit it on the dog properly which was not helpful because it is on the dog properly. As I said, proper training is the only thing that will make a significant difference for a pulling and overly excited dog. The company should not promise that the harness will do this. Purchase this harness if you like the look of it. But save your money if you are looking for help."
4294,3,"First off the size of the stone is shorter than more expensive stone I bought from Amazon by half an inch. This is not a biggie if you are sharpening smaller knives but I had to be cognizant of it when sharpening a chef knife.Secondly, the 400 grit side does not seem to be keeping any water even after soaking it for two days! It gets dry within a few seconds and I have to keep putting water on the surface so that the knife does screech during the strokes.I sharpened a dull knife and it seemed to be reasonably sharp, but not super sharp that it can just cut paper without sawing motion, after going through 400 and 1000 grit sides. I suspect I would need a higher quality 6000 grit stone as well. I would say this stone is good enough for most of the people."
4295,3,"Pretty much what all the other negative reviews say. Extremely soft, and for some reason there's a huge logo on one of the flat sides - really? It will sharpen really dull knives, but for kitchen knifes it's too coarse IMO. That's possibly because of the softness, which means you get many particles separating off the stone and causing a kind of sandpaper jagged edge instead of a smooth edge. Almost works better with oil than water, even though it clearly says to use water."
4296,3,"must be used wet. the stencil (that covers almost an entire side) refuses to sharpen anything so you really only have one side. there is no way to tell the two sides apart and they really don't do much differently.Will it work in a pinch, yes, just soak the entire thing in water and use it underwater if possible. It is kinda difficult to use dry.also it is more like 600/1000 definately not 400/2000 as I was told."
4297,3,"I've been using this stone for months and have started to find that, while the fine side does provide a nice sharp edge, the 400gr side is wearing my knives unevenly, which causes me to be unable to finely sharpen the entire length of the blade when moving to the fine side. The logo that is put in the middle of the 400gr side of the knife is causing more material to be removed than the rest of the blade when I'm sweeping across. I even verified this by going straight down the length of the fine side and watching the wear pattern come from the material coming off of the knife onto the stone.Checking with a surface plate at home and at work I've also verified the edge is not staying straight and curves inward towards the spine before the tip starts, which is where my knife typically stops traveling over the logo.I'm likely just going to throw this stone away. It was nice at first, and I sharpened 20+ knives in my kitchen to a fantastic edge after getting it. But after consistently using it I've found this wear pattern in 3 knives using this stone to maintain them. This is unacceptable."
4298,2,"After sharpening the blade from my hand plane for 25 min (seemed like forever), it's a little sharper, but it's not 'shave your arm hair' sharp. It also doesn't pass the finger nail test (if it's sharp, it should rest on your finger nail when you hang it vertically down onto your nail, if it's dull it will slide off). This is not my first time sharpening this blade, and in the past I've gotten it sharp just with 400 and 1200 grit sand paper.Also I'm not sure if this is normal, but a lot of green stuff was coming off the stone during the process. At one point a chunk of it came off. But then as I continued the block got flat again."
4299,2,Well pro is the paper does sand and polish and do what sandpaper is supposed to do. However....The quality of this sandpaper leaves ALOT to be desired. The paper is brittle so when I went to sand and it folded over it cracked and broke apart. When I removed a sheet from the package it took a few minutes before the paper was curled into a circle.Bottom line? I’ll use it because the sanding ability is good. I will not be buying again because of the terrible quality.
4300,1,Not sure who made this stuff but wet sanding with it was a nightmare not compared to other brands I have used be for.I will not get in to details but if you want to make some thing shiny and flat this is not you paper. May have other craft uses but spend the extra money and get 3m or a brand that has good QA... This stuff does not last long plan to buy twice as much.
4301,1,"tried to save money by buying this instead of 3M...noticed very quickly on my project that the grits didn't really correspond to the number. 3000 took off more paint then 2500 by a large margin. I am wet sanding a enamel painted cabinet. went to the auto-store and bought name brand paper that costs a LOT more but honestly saved my project, so much nicer to work with. Basically if you value your project don't try to cut corners with cheap sandpaper..."
4302,3,"I specified silicon carbide in my search because i needed to make a sapphire lens frosted. these sandpaper sheets are unable to scratch the sapphire however, which SiC shoud be able to (and i have used other brands before which had). sapphire is quite a hard material, and thus only SiC, or diamond abrasive will really scartch its surface.the sandpaper works fine for nearly anything else of course. but i am rating it low because to the best testing i can discern it is not SiC an abrasive as advertised.If the seller would like to contest this I'd be happy to change my review if there is better proof that can be offered on this."
4303,3,"Bought the large pack as a backup for when my higher quality stuff runs out and I forget to replace it. I decided to try out the more aggressive paper on a block and oscillation sander. The paper tears and wears down incredibly fast in comparison to even slightly more expensive alternatives. The higher (above 1500) paper works decent for smoothing and polishing, but any real deep work (refinishing a dining room table) is a complete waste."
4304,3,"Purchased the Craftsman Grinder on Amazon and these blades came up “frequently bought together” so I bought these blades too. Except they don’t work on the Craftsman! These are type 1 blades and the manual for the tool states not to use type 1 blades but use type 27. Went to return theses and it says “not eligible for return” even though there is nothing on the original sale page saying that they are not eligible for return.Amazon, you need to fix the frequently bought together feature if it misleads people to think these fit. And they need to take returns from those of use that fell for it."
4305,3,"I was planning to buy these cheap cut off disks, but after reading an article ""Is This Dewalt Cut-Off Wheel Still Good? Answer: No, it Expired"" in ToolGuyd I gave up. Cheap? Yes. But look at the date engraved on the metal ring on the disks pictured on the item page, it's 2003. They are EXPIRED 15 years ago?! It's 2018 now! Or they just haven't updated the original stock image? Well, it's unclear so I'd avoid buying these at least without asking the seller. Of course, it's your choice. But I decided my safety doesn't worth a couple of saved bucks."
4306,3,"I ordered this product, it is the 4-1/2 inch cutting wheel for my grinder and I received 6 inch cutting wheel. I simply don't have a grinder that size or I would just keep them and order again. I tried to do a return or send back through this website and it won't let me. It says the item is not eligible for a return, yet i see it says there is a 30 day warranty. I can't get in contact with anyone to explain the simple mix up so I am at a loss. I just need the correct size and I would happily mail these back and change my review. The other product i ordered from Dewalt that came with it is fantastic and works great! Need help!!"
4307,3,"I can't believe how DeWalt has cheapened it's brand. Most of the tools are still good but the accessories have all turned to junk. These cutoff discs are a perfect example. I only use quality cutoff discs because I've seen what can happen with cheap Harbor Freight discs, and these are just as bad as Harbor Freight. These wear out very quickly and throw off a lot of debris. I used up one entire disc making a 24"" cut in 1/8"" plate steel. Good thing they come in a 5 pack because you'll need more than one for your project."
4308,1,"Shipped promptly. That's all the good I have to say about these. I bought these to cut angle iron for a large project. After reading all the reviews I was excited that these would be far superior to the ""Freight"" store cheapo disks I have been using. They are NO better than the $4.99-for-5 on sale disks. I was expecting them to cut way better, being a name brand. I am back to using my ""Freight"" store disks, which are cutting slightly faster. They might last longer but I can't say. I have a deadline and don't have time to waste with these. I will use them eventually but will never buy them again. Not the first time I have been disappointed with a Dewalt product. I think maybe this time, I've learned my lesson. NO BETTER THAN CHEAP DISKS !!!!"
4309,3,"Waste of money... The 1000 grit side absorbs any amount of water on it (even after soaking) in a few seconds. It's useable but very sub par.The 6 thousand grit side is pure hot garbage. After every pass, metal flakes become embedded into to way too soft surface and has to be buffed out with a cleaning stone. Have fun doing this 20-30 times in a row. The end result was that actually dulled my knife and I had to go back to the 1k side...Word to the wise, for a little more than this price get a good 1k stone by Shapton, Chosera/Naniwa, King, or any other Japanese brand stone."
4310,3,Picked this up because of the positive reviews. I was extremely disappointed by the quality of everything.The stone itself is decent quality. My box was a bit smashed but it also looks as though the packaging was printed poorly with blurry ink. This to me says that the seller doesn't care a lot about their packaging which to me is the equivalent to walking into a dirty bathroom at a business.The wood stand is also a meh condition. They couldnt even glue the rubber bottom part on straight. Mine is like glued on at a gnarly slant and thats very disappointing to see with a product that has so many positive reviews.Maybe its just me and I have high standards or something but this was quite a disappointing purchase.
4311,1,"Ive been a Mate and a Sea Captain for years. Although the knives on the boat are not always the greatest they are kept sharp. I received some new knives for my kitchen and wanted to upgrade the way Ive been keeping an edge on them. I thought this would fine tune them. I watched the video and unboxed the stone. (The box was damaged when I opened the amazon bag that was perfect. Damage was prior to bagging.) The stone was fine but the guide was missing. Not a deal breaker though. I took my 9"" Henkel that was very sharp but wanted to polish it. After soaking the stone for more than 20 minutes I began to attempt to sharpen. The fine side of this stone was rated 6000. It seemed like soap. The stone quickly wore down and my blade would dig into the stone if I turned my edge. The stone became pastelike. (Unlike the paste I've developed on oil or other water stones.) I really wanted to like this due to the overwhelming reviews so I cleaned the stone and walked away. Two days later I just now attempted to sharpen the same knife. Ive been attempting to rotate the stone not to wear down one spot and still the stone is almost mushy. The blade has become noticeably duller.My father sharpens his pocket knife on the bottom of his ceramic tea cup and keeps a razor sharp edge said the stones are garbage. This was not a post to bash the seller because I really wanted the stone to work and for the life of me I can't understand all the positive reviews unless the products are different. Good Luck with your purchase.Feeling guilty I attempted to sharpen a different knife. I found I had the same results and the stone needs to be resurfaced its total worn after two knives. Both knives need to be resharpened. Very disappointed."
4312,2,"Really disappointed in this. I got it after a friend gifted me a Shun knife, so I figured I'd need a nice sharpener. I followed the instructions to a T, and my knife ended up even duller than it was before. I followed several YouTube tutorials to make sure I did it right, and it still ended up dull. So upset with this. I went back to my regular sharpener and it was incredibly sharp.I wish I could return this but it's been too long. I bought it as soon as I got the new knife and it obviously didn't need sharpening before now. The thing doesn't work and it's honestly really obnoxious to deal with since it has to be submerged in water for 10 minutes before you can even use it. I completely wasted my money."
4313,3,"I looked up several youtube videos how to do the job, fiddled around now with one knife for 20min with very little improvement. What I can say is that the skin of my hands are extremely dry now. As there are plenty of cheaper options out there of sharpeners with hundreds or thousands of good reviews (I love reviewmeta dot com), this stone goes to the trash to free up space. Maybe this is good for someone with a $200 Sushi knife who pays cheap labor to someone in the kitchen to do the job regularly. For my average value household knives it did not work."
4314,3,"I received this and immediately noticed the coarse side of the stone was badly pitted. Naturally, I returned the item. A note on the size of the puck as well. I have what I would guess are average size hands and holding this puck, seems like an accident waiting to happen. It's very small....maybe 3"" or so. This puts your fingers right in the danger zone. The shape of the stone forces you to have your fingers on the wide middle section. If it were designed with the wide parts on the outside and a smaller section at the center, it would lend it self to keeping your fingers further away from the work piece.I'm going to opt for a rectangular double sided water stone so I can keep my fingers away from the edge of the item being sharpened. I do like the idea of the size of this for camping, but most of my work will be done at home so I'll opt for the larger stone."
4315,3,"I purchased this in order to sharpen my new, unused shovel and some machetes. This instructions included do not inform you on how to use it other than making circular motions. It does not say at what angle to employ the device. The company website is even more deplorable. You try to buy ""American"", but it seems as most are 'asleep at the wheel'. I utterly regret this purchase."
4316,3,"Way too coarse, even on the ""fine"" side. It would be helpful to have an actual grit size mentioned in the description. If you need a ""field stone"" to do some serious shaping on an edge or to take a nick out (that's some serious shaping) this would do it, but that's a job for at home because it will still take a lot of time. This is not going to put a truly fine edge on your axe. The edge will be quite ""toothy,"" so if that's the kind of edge you want, this should work. Quality-wise, it seems made as well as any decent manufactured ""stone"" I have. It's handy, it's nostalgic, but it's way too course for the kind of ""touch-up"" work I'd do to an axe when afield. Leave it on the bench and have several finer grits to finish your edge after using this for the initial dirty work of reshaping or reprofiling an edge."
4317,1,I have been using this stone for several months now as opposed to those giving it 5 stars before they even received or used the item. I'm sorry to report that using this after a file on both my machetes and axes actually dulls them. Even when using honing oil I don't get acceptable results. I can only imagine that those raving about the results had really dull edges and don't know what a sharp edge is like. Skip this purchase if you have a file.
4318,2,"Just delivered, although I haven't used it yet...that doesn't mean it hasn't been tested by someone else. Delivered with a couple of grooves and scratches on! If I wanted a used one, I would have ordered one! I appreciate I am going to beat the crap out of it myself sharpening an axe, but it is the principal! What's the phrase...caveat emptor!It is about the third time I have had this BS from an Amazon sale."
4319,3,"We have a small set of 4 ceramic knives that I wanted to see if I could get a little sharper. I used both the coarse and fine diamond belts on all 4 of the knives in the set. The knives are a tiny bit sharper than when I started but not nearly as sharp as the steel knives I sharpened with the standard belts.It is really hard to see any difference in the edge of the knives from before to after sharpening with these belts. If you buy them, don't expect very much from them."
4320,3,"I got this to sharpen my ceramic kitchen knives, along with the Work Sharp sharpener. I watched a few videos on how to sharpen ceramic knives with these, and I still cannot get them sharp. The Work Sharp works great on our regular kitchen knives... making them sharp enough to shave the hair off the back of my hand. These however...I ran each ceramic knife through 20 times with the coarse belt, 20 fine... still dull.40 times with coarse, 30 with fine... still dull... duller than the steel knives.60 times with coarse, 40 with fine... yup... still duller than my high school economics teacher.Sharper than they were I'd have to say... and not as sharp as the steel knives.Not sharp enough to slice tomatoes without some frustration.And...it's only my wife and I in the kitchen, so I don't feel as though the ceramic knives have been abused."
4321,1,"The system seems to work as stated. However, if someone expects to come up with a really sharp blade you will be disappointed. I assume the issue is that the sanding belt will flex a lot and consequently the cutting edge is being rounded.Also, by using the guide one side of the blade will get an upstroke while the other side of the same blade will receive a down stroke. This matters little for some rough cutting tools but you will not achieve a honed edge on a quality knife."
4322,3,"I purchased this in May 2015 and when I received the box, I just put it with my Work Sharp machine. Well, two months later, I get the machine out to sharpen some knives and open the box of new fine grit belts, and the box was empty. They had shipped me an empty box. The tape was still sealed and it had not been removed from the box since I had received it. Very aggravating. I will have to order more but this time, I will verify that the belts are in the box."
4323,3,"No one seems to mention that the tool will scratch a polished blade no matter how careful you are at using it. First. The guides guide as they are supposed to but the instructions say to make sure the knife is touching against the outside edge of the guide. When you do this you will find that it will scratch the outside edge of your blade opposite the edge being sharpened with horizontal scratch marks.This shows up pretty clearly on a polished blade. They should use Teflon or felt in these guides to prevent this. If you back the pressure off the outside edge you risk sanding or scratching not only the edge of the blade but also the side of the blade to be sharpened as well.I think all the reviews of this product have been paid for or overstated to sell the product. Sharpening lawn equipment fine. But sharpening quality knifes use the old method,a quality whetstone. I scratched a pretty good knife in the process. I will need to polish the scratches out with some extra work I had not planned on. If it's too good to be true then it probably is. Lesson learned.Pros: Amazon shipped order super fast.Cons: Do not use this sharpener on quality knives or polished knives if you are a collector."
4324,3,"Corona is for betty homemakers. I wouldn't sharpen a crayon with this. There are three ways to sharpen things properly. #1 a high speed grinding wheel (you better know exactly what your doing), #2 a sharpening stone, #3 any Japanese or German sharpening product.this flimsy little thing will turn your thumb into a lacerated pool of hell."
4325,1,"I sharpen knives as a part-time job, and as a professional sharpener, I will say that all carbide sharpeners do is jack up your blade. They are horrible for your knife. They remove way too much metal and just shear metal from the edge of your knife instead of gently grinding it away, leaving you with a ragged edge that doesn't cut worth a damn, and is going to get dull again extremely quickly.In order to sharpen a knife, you must remove steel from the edge. The goal is to create a new apex, thus giving you a sharp cutting edge. The problem with carbide sharpeners is the method by which they remove steel. Carbide sharpeners literally ""cut"" or ""Shear"" steel from the blade and leave the blade in shambles. There are many pictures in sharpening books that show how ragged the edge of a knife blade looks after sharpening with a carbide sharpener. On the other hand, sharpening a blade with a proper sharpening stone gradually ""grinds"" or ""abrades"" steel from the blade and also polishes and refines the edge, resulting in a smooth, polished, longer lasting, and much better performing cutting edge.Carbide sharpeners are only favored in recent times because the vast majority of society are clueless about how to use a traditional sharpening stone. It's not hard; an inexpensive sharpening stone and about 10 minutes on youtube is all you need to get started. I would avoid any tungsten carbide sharpener at all costs!"
4326,1,"This Corona Clipper AC 8300 Sharpening Tool will ruin nearly every blade you apply it to.When given the choice I always chose to buy Corona tools all my life. They are good quality tools. But this sharpener has no control to it. The carbide is extremely sharp and will remove material from just about any tool you have. The problem is the small amount of surface area in contact with the edge being sharpend. This allows for gouging to occur even with the slightest pressure. I ruined two pairs of scissors and had to spend an hour with my honing stones to repair the edge on my pruner.Corona should be ashamed to place their name on this tool. The only reason I can see for doing so, is that their competitors sell the same style sharpener. So, Corona is just trying to get you to spend that little bit extra of your hard earned money. Save your cash and stick with your honing stones."
4327,3,"It certainly met it's advertised purpose, and I used it to sharpen several scissors and shears. Works fine. But a cheaper file that I already had would have served just as well.It's advantage is that it is smaller and handler than a big dirty file. So it fits in a pocket easily and comfortably.But it wasn't really needed. t should have analyzed the product better before I purchased it. Oh well, I like it well enough."
4328,3,I was really impressed with how well it sharpens gardening tools. However I tried using it's on several knives and a couple saw blades and I'm pretty sure it made everything now dull. I even practiced for a while on a couple old knives and it was just an inferior tool than any other sharpener I've used. 800 grit sandpaper on a wooden block works infinitely better.
4329,1,"I decided to give this a try based on the many positive reviews. With over a decade of detailing experience I can honestly say that this product was my biggest let down to date. If your headlights are extremely yellow. This will get rid of the yellow. However it lacks the finesse necessary to achieve a scratch free result. No matter how many times I repeated the last two steps, the fine scratches that were created during the sanding process still remained. I will now have to reach for another compound to achieve a final scratch free result. I recommend skipping this product altogether due to the scratchy finish."
4330,1,"I’ll tell you an objective, honest review. This product is not the quality you might expect from 3M. The sandpaper pads do not last long enough to complete the job in a satisfactory way, and you get several pads too. I ordered 2 kits and it was not enough. The worst part is the headlight seems like it’s in worse condition that the original hazy lights. I managed to get one light looking good but the other one is not done and I’m not buying more kits. The sandpaper is not good enough and doesn’t last long. If you want to get it done, get it done the right way and spend more money elsewhere."
4331,2,"My headlights on a 2005 Honda Odyssey and 2004 Lexus ES330 look WORSE than when I started. I followed the directions exactly, watching videos on how to do it as well. As you can see from my pictures, the Odyssey lights look WORSE. They are foggy and have small scratches all over them. When I started on the odyssey they were clear but had some small foggy places and larger scratches I thought for sure would go away with this kit. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS KIT. I AM NOW LEFT WITH FOGGY, severely scratches headlights that I now have to replace.The Lexus lenses are not yellow anymore, BUT they are super foggy and not clear at all.I am FURIOUS. I read so many positive reviews. I should have trusted all of the one star reviews as they were so right."
4332,1,"If you have quite a bite of oxidation or scratches this product will bring your lights back to 85% of what they used to look likeIn my scenario one of my headlights had a streak of scratches down the center and mild oxidation around the edges. With that being said, there were parts of the light that were still in pretty new condition. I watched every video, read the instructions very carefully, and used this product exactly as instructed. Unfortunately, my headlight now has a haze and fog to it and I would say it looks worse than before. Again, it did remove the deep scratches and oxidation but now the entire lens has a slight haze and really looks terrible. Be cautious on what light you use this on. Overall I am a fan of 3M products and use them almost daily but I just can't recommend this one."
4333,1,"I'm not sure i could be more disappointed with this kit. I bought it with high expectations, but was definitely let down. After spending 2 hours on the first step of the first headlight, I was left with smears and gouges after having used almost all of the sanding pads. Given the relatively small amount of yellowing and frosting on my lights, I found this surprising.The final result was not much better. I was still left with a light haze and I was unable to buff out some of the gouges after another 2 hours of work.For the second headlight, I started with a 220 grit foam sanding pad, which was much more efficient at removing pits and yellowing. Then I hand sanded with the remaining pads in the kit, which resulted in a much better final product in about 25% the time. So at this point I'm left with one headlight that looks great, and another that is probably permanently damaged.I thought this kit would be less effort because it used a drill--I was wrong. It starts at 500 grit, which is excessively high and results in wildly inefficient time spent. It is also very easy to overheat the headlight and cause smearing. Having tried both the drill and hand sanding, the latter is absolutely the way to go.Go with the McGuires or Sylvania kit. I wouldn't recommend this method to anyone."
4334,1,"Attempted to use between coats of shellac on some cabinet drawers. I've used steel wool in that fashion many times, and it works well. This product is horrible, balls up on first contact, and can't be unfolded before or after. I also noticed quite a bit of rougher (like 0 or 00) wire mixed in. I didn't worry about it for my purposes, but if used for actual finishing, it would leave some nasty scratches.I tossed the bag and used a different brand- everything went fine after that.
One person found this helpful."
4335,3,"Not necessarily a bad product, but didn't work well for the project I had purchased it for. I had read that you can use 0000 steel wool and chrome polish to remove light scratches from chrome. I tried this on my 1965 Malibu SS and it left a hazy spot. Probably works well for a million other practical uses, just not the one I bought it for, which is why I went with 2 stars."
4336,2,"I have bought this product at least twice. Our purchase of this steel wool is for a very specific purpose and this review is limited to only that.I cannot comment on any other use of this product! We have a small window cleaning business and we use 000 steel wool (wet) to scrub the windows. Other brands of steel wool were causing us a problem. Once they were wet, the steel wool would leak a greenish fluid (oil?) and it would get our bucket of water dirty very quickly. This is simply not acceptable so I started comparing brands and this one came out on top! At least at first.Now this latest batch of steel wool (I bought 10 packages) is doing the same thing. Bummer!So back to trying other brands."
4337,3,"I bought this 0000 steel wool to prepare a shellac finish prior to applying wax over a shellac finish. It shed so much lint that it stuck in the body of the wax. Besides looking terrible, the steel lint will turn brown over time as it rusts, making a mess of the finish. I had to strip everything down and start from scratch. No good for finishing fine wood furniture or any woodworking project, really."
4338,1,steel wool is steel wool. this is good quality. I bought this to polish my windshield as others said it would work without scratching it but that is false. this left tiny fine scratches all over my windows which can be seen when there is a glare. it is much worse than before. Now i have to deal with a foggy windshield with micro-scratches everywhere. I'm hoping some wax will help but I do NOT recommend this on windows.
4339,3,"I purchased this item to use in conjunction with my current King brand water stone. Needless to say, the bearmoo stone has not met my expectations..... it claims it is a 3000/8000 grit stone. I have not found this to be the case, as my King brand stone is a 1000/6000 and the bearmoo stone's 8000 side feels about the same as the 1000 side on the King stone. If you are like me and are purchasing this to polish a blade, don't waste your money! The King brand 1000/6000 stone does a much better job! I have also compared the grit on the bearmoo stone with brand name Wet/dry sandpaper and found about the same results so it's not just a bias that I like the King stone much better."
4340,2,"If you are new to sharpening and want something quick and easy to learn, this is not it, I've watched countless YouTube videos and tutorials I've tried different angles different techniques, different knives and nothing is able to put a halfway decent edge on a knife with this stone, I purchased the 400/1000 and a 3000/8000 and cannot find desired results, my suggestion is that if you don't have expensive knives (over $200) then buy a cheap 1x30 belt sander with some 400 grit belts and a leather belt (all this was only $20 more than these stones) and you will be much happier, I can get even my cheapest knives to shave hair in under 5 minutes on the belt sander, and I can't even get them to cut paper after hours on these stones."
4341,3,"I originally purchased this, as well as a lower grit combination stone, as a compact counterpart to my larger stones. Despite the item name, this is not a 3000/8000 grit combination stone. I tried using it to put a final polish on my chisels, which was after using 1200 grit sandpaper to hone the edge. This stone actually removed the polish put on by the sandpaper. Both sides produced a cloudy, uneven sheen, even after taking the time to flatten the stone (it was badly dished upon arrival), and further removing the first 1/8 inch of material.As well, both sides were prone to chipping and gouging from small impacts. At one point, the corner of the stone broke away when I took the rubber protector off.I will be e-mailing their customer service team in a few minutes to see if they have any idea what the issue is, and forwarding them this review. I will happily amend it if it turns out I was not using the stone correctly, but I honestly don't think that is the issue in this case. If I can get some pictures in the next few days, I will add them as well."
4342,3,"I bought both the 400/1000 and 3000/8000 combo stones. After many uses and loads of frustration, I could not recommend these to anyone, even if you are on a budget. The “8000” stone is no where near that grit. If you polish an edge with 2000 grit wet sandpaper, this 8000 stone will take it right off. If you can’t afford a decent stone, buy some wet sandpaper instead. These are not worth the money."
4343,3,"I’m no pro, but have been sharpening my own knives for a couple years using a high-end 1000/3000 Japanese whetstone. My every day knife is a Wusthof Ikon 8” chefs knife and I maintain a shavings edge on it. Thought I’d try something finer to see how much better it could get and gave this stone a try because the reviews are favorable and...well, it’s cheap. The 6000 side was so coarse that it raised a fresh burr in a matter of minutes. I think the stone is mis-marked, as it felt and ground like a 400. I mean, there’s no way I could form a burr like that with a true 6000 stone. Appalled, I started a fresh edge with my trusty 1000/3000 and had a new shaving edge in about 10 minutes. I’m returning this thing, as it’s not a 6000, and will spend the money for a stone worthy of my steel. This one was just all wrong."
4344,2,"I've loved my P-C 333 sander but when the hook and loop pad finally wore out I ordered the replacement, which lasted about one hour. It appears that the phenolic material that the 3 screws pass through to attach to the sander is thinner than that of the original pad. The screws were tight (even after the pad went flying off the sander) but there must have been some play that allowed the screw threads to eat away at the phenolic plate until the holes became large enough to slip over the screw heads. Rather than order another pad, I guess I'll just get another brand of sander. (I do commend Amazon, however, for their generous and easy return policy.)"
