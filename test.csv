4345,1,"I say I use my 332 for a total of less than 5 hours, about 10 minutes average each time over the life time of the tool, and it is still in great condition. But just like many others, the pad broke off the screws and flew off. It is a poor design. PC should have said ""...it is for LIGHT SANDING only. Don't press hard, don't use say less than 300 grid paper etc."" I will not recommend anyone to buy this tool unless you are prepared to spend $18.00 on replacement pads often. Buy some cheap China made sander for less than $20.00 when on sale. !! So what if the 332 unit is very powerful, comfortable to hold and the dust bag design is very good. ...And there is little we can do to fix the issue because over time, the foamy padding material disintegrate and the screws lose their holding power, especially if the tool is kept in a hostile workshop environment (solvents, paints, corroding dust etc.)USA, wake up.... or more U.S. factory people will be out of a job !!However, we must be thankful that Amazon.com still carries this product and discounted price, or else we will have to pay list price from Porter Cable."
4346,3,"The Replacement Pad for a Porter Cable 333 Sander failed after 2 sanding sessions. The Pad does not fit the Sander properly and is of a poor design. The last time I used it, the pad came flying off the sander. Upon investigation, it was determined that the holes on the pad are too large for the screws on the bottom of the sander. There fore any pressure that you will might apply will cause the pad to distort and separate from the base.This represents a real flying hazard for anyone standing near by!"
4347,3,"Loved these for the first two hours. After I paired them with two devices they stopped working correctly. Any type of audio would play for only a second and then stop. I tried everything to get them to work including going back to pairing them with only one device and they never worked correctly again. I called customer support and they worked through a few things and then determined that the sensors on the headphones which mute a call or pause the music when you take them off was interfering with the ability to play audio. Their suggestion was to turn off the sensors. The customer care rep didn't see anything wrong with this option. They were brand new and their fix was to turn off one of the functions in order to get them to work. I told him why I didn't think that was acceptable and he said ""I guess you could look at it that way."" He then said if I wasn't satisfied I'd have to return them. Here is the kicker. If I was within the Amazon 15 day return period (thankfully I was) I could return to Amazon and get a new pair. If I was outside the 15 day Amazon window I could return them to Plantronics and they would replace with a REFURBISHED pair. So they won't replace your headphones with a new pair if they are older than 15 days. This solidified my decision to return them to Amazon and get a different brand of headphones entirely. Also, the customer care dude didn't apologize ONCE for all the trouble. It was as if I was being unreasonable by expecting all functions to work. I don't expect much from customer service operations these days, but this was really beyond par."
4348,2,"I've had the PC 333 for at least 6 years now, never a problem. The foam pad finally peeled apart from the mounting material (Bakelite maybe?) recently so I ordered the replacement from Amazon. After no more than 30 minutes worth of use the new pad fell off the sander. Sure enough, like some reviewers have posted, the 3 screws that are used to mount the pad to the sander rounded out their mounting holes and the pad simply fell off the sander. I'm not sure why they don't use the same original material to mount the pad, like I said it looks like Bakelite but I don't think that stuff is legal/available anymore, but that plastic mounting pad is in perfect shape, it just doesn't have the foam pad on it anymore. It's now on it's way back to Amazon. I think I'll try the DeWalt now."
4349,3,Was working great for about a months time and then the rod bent making it unusable. Possibility from miss use but feeling more towards bad quality. Replaced shortly after with a higher quality replacement and have not had a problem sense. I used this daily when operative as I am a mechanic.
4350,3,I ordered 2 of these Roloc Disc Pad Holders only to have 1 OK and the other with the Roloc thread receiver obviously crushed from the side making it completely useless. A simple visual inspection would have revealed this damage well before the product ever reached any stage of delivery to the customer. Disappointing!
4351,3,"It came but it didn't come with a shank as described. I tried to get one sent but amazon just refunded the whole purchase price and let me keep the holder. which is cool. but I still cant use it without a shank, I'll find something to make a shank. 3M does however sell a quality roloc disc holder kit. its about $15.00 on amazon. Just do some searching and you'll find it."
4352,3,"I bought this so I'd have one at home and thought it'd be nice to order on-line. This DOES NOT fit 3M Rolocs. What I found is that it fits the cheap Harbor Freight Roloc ""type"" discs and appears to be the same holder from their kits. I only gave it 2 stars because at least it does SOMETHING.. even if it's not what it was described to be."
4353,3,"This is a ""meh"" holder. The rubber was distorted and uneven so one side of the sanding disc would wear out faster and eventually rip apart. On top of all that it was very unbalanced and after a while of using it my hand was tingly. I forced my company into buying me a good one and it was great. If this is used in a hobby setting it would be great but I use this every day for deburring parts. It's a fantastic price for what it is though.....and could possibly be made better."
4354,1,"This thing comes with two different colored sides, assuming that one is rough and one is smooth. No both sides are the same and they are a little rough, but the problem with this is it might work the first time you sharper your knife but the second or third time you notice that the sharpener is really smooth and has no coarse to it. You might as well use you counter top to sharpen the knife."
4355,1,I didn't have a good experience with this stone. It has jagged side edges that are higher than the sharpening surface of the stone. The stone surface is also not level thus I could never get it to properly sharpen my scandi grind knives. I gave it a fair trial then ended up tossing it in the garbage. It was only a few dollars so I guess I got what I paid for. Can't expect much for that price. Avoid this stone and go for a higher quality one.
4356,1,It goes to say that you get what you pay for. The coarse side is definitely good for blade repair but like some of the other reviews the stone came with raised edges which makes it impossible to use in a reliable way. The fine side however didn't have the previously mentioned problem but it is still a bit to coarse to get that perfect razor sharp edge. I'd suggest spending the extra money and get a higher quality stone from a company that takes more pride in the quality of the products they produce.
4357,3,"I simply cannot get any of my knives to become sharper using this stone. I've tried different techniques, wet, dry, oiled, etc. It just makes sharp knives dull and dull knives remain dull. I can use other stones with reasonable success. I'm stumped why this one fails me. To be fair, it could be user error, but the odds of that are slim."
4358,3,"Mine had a raised 'lip' around the entire perimeter of one of the sides. Hard to describe. But that lip completely prevents you being able to sharpen anything with smooth strokes, as the blade will bump into the lip, and easily put a deny into the blade. The opposite side seems fine, but this company needs to pay better attention to their molding process. This item was like $3, so I didn't bother returning it."
4359,3,"Sorry, I'm just not a fan. This stone does ok for tools like shovels or axes, but I just couldn't get the hang of it with knives. The diamond stones were too coarse and seemed to really grab the edge and prevent you from maintaining your angle. The absurdly fat handle also gets in the way when you're trying to sharpen, rending a good quarter of the stones useless for most tasks. I ended up picking up a set of credit card diamond stones and am much happier with my result.Adding a star because due to how handy this sharpener is for garden tools. I'm able to touch up the edge on items like mower blades without unmounting. Unlike a file, the diamond stones give you alot of control over the material you're removing so I'm not worried about thowing off the blade's balance. The handle that's annoying for sharpening knives works much better for tools where I'm more worried about comfort and protection over precision. If it were a few dollars cheaper I would add a star or two, unfortunately it's too much money for a tool on permanent lawn and garden duty."
4360,3,"So I bought this sharpener at the local Cabela's because I needed something to sharpen my knives (other than my parents kitchen knife electric sharpener). I've been using this for about 3 days on every knife I own and it won't sharpen a single on of them (in fact, they are duller than they were before I used this sharpener). I am not sure if I am doing it wrong (I'm following the instructions that come with this and have watched instructional videos online on how to use it properly) or maybe the blades on my knives are complete garbage. Either way this sharpener has not been what I expected it to be. There are some positive aspects to this though which are the size, the ability to store it in the handle, and the price. I am gonna look at buying Smith's TRI-6 Arkansas TRI-HONE Sharpening Stones System instead and see if that makes a difference."
4361,3,"I have a hard time finding a use for this.You can't easily repeat an angle with it, so it's difficult to create a sharp edge. It's kind of like using a square honing steel, which files off metal much faster.You also can't get the abrasive surface to lay flat on a work surface, because there's a hard plastic hilt that prevents it from getting level or stable.I think in the average user's hands, it's more likely to ruin the consistency or sharpness of a blade edge than it is to sharpen it. The only thing I can imagine using it for getting a rough edge on an axe or something.The product is exactly as advertised, but in my case a mistake to buy."
4362,1,"I was thrilled at how fast and efficient this product was. The diamond coating makes a huge difference in how fast you can sharpen knives. The reason I give this such a low rating is the quality sucks. After using this to sharpen 5 or 6 knives I noticed the thing stopped working. I got to looking and realized the diamond coating had come off. Smith's website said you will notice the coating come off during the first sharpening but that was normal it's like excess and was normal. It also said the diamond coating was permanently bonded to the sharpener but in my case this is not true. If Smith can find a way to keep the diamond coating to stay on this would be one of my favorite field sharpening hones. Until they come out with a better way to bond the diamonds do not buy this, instead buy the workshop field sharpener. "
4363,3,"This sharpener is not as good as the granite stone I replaced with this. Too bad I threw that rock away already. This is a great sharpener for people who don't like their blades super sharp; for fear they'll cut themselves. UPDATE: After less than 4 months of light duty personal kitchen use, it has chinks along the edge and has lost its bite."
4364,3,"I needed a new lighting cord, especially a longer one (6 feet) so I bought this one in thoughts that the Nylon will make it last longer since that's the idea with nylon braided cables. At first sight and opening the package, it was seemed like it was good quality and it seemed like it was going to be promising but it actually doesn't work. I've plugged it into my charging block which came with my iPad and left it for an hour and when it was time to get up and go, I realized it only charged a couple percentages. Not too long after, it wouldn't even charge, nor would my phone even recognize that it was plugged in. I've used the regular iPhone charging block and nothing happened. I had to go back to using my old frayed cable for the mean time. I guess I just received a defective one?"
4365,3,"If you're like me, despite your best efforts, your iphone charger probably just broke. Again if you're like me, you probably handled it with what any reasonable person would call care, and yet somehow, it's managed to be frayed beyond recognition and finally gave out a few hours ago.So now you're on the search for something stronger, you think to yourself you want to buy a better cable this time, not and not just something a little better, you want something MUCH STRONGER, it needs to be made out of metal and braided nylon so strong you could walk on it like a tightrope in your spare time!Well that iPhone cable doesn't exist, but you found this one, and it looks pretty darn strong. I agree, it's even got the little molded plastic pieces leading up near the end, that if you've done your research you'll know are a sign of grade-A cable design, and hey, it's got the amazon brand on it, so it must be good!Well I'm writing to say, not so fast. You see while this cable seems in every way to be great from a mechanical perspective, something doesn't hold up internally. About three weeks after buying this, mine still looks good enough to put in a museum, but one side of it quit charging my phone yesterday, and now the other causes the screen to flash on and off about 100 times a second. It's a great idea, I love the feeling and build quality, but on the inside it's just not as durable as the other amazon basics cables, or for that matter, even the original apple ones."
4366,3,"Gotta say I'm a huge fan of Amazon and even their Amazon Basics stuff is made pretty well, but this cable has officially died on me. I bought this cable way back in May of this year. I bought it to leave at work, should I ever need to charge my phone there. I had used it occasionally and only just recently had I really noticed how slow it charged. With in the last couple of weeks I would plug my phone into charge for the ride home from work and realized that it hadn't really been charging at all. I've used it little over 10 times and it really only ever worked around 3 times early on. Now as I'm writing this review I have it plugged into my computer and still no luck. What a bummer."
4367,2,"This cable looked great and worked great, right up until the point it tried to burn my house down. I noticed my iPhone was getting a bit warm where the cable connects to the lightning jack. So I unplugged it thinking it was just a glitch in the iphone’s charging system. I left the cable on the floor.When I came from work 8 hours later, I found the melted blob pictured. I have no doubt that if I had left the cable on a flammable surface it would have started a fire.If you have these cables, do not leave them plugged in unattended."
4368,3,"I was very pleased with the quality of the product as I received it. But after about one week of charging it became intermittent for a couple of days and then stopped working. I think it is important to point out that this cord is in one location, I sit my phone on a table surface and let it charge all night. So no moving, no using it while connected or such. I also an not the type of person that unplugs it by pulling on the cored or such. This just proved to me that they cord was either defective as received or poor quality (or maybe a combo of both). Now it is much cheaper than an APPLE cord, but I would expect more. Wish it would have done better....I had I hopes being an Amazon product!"
4369,3,"This product does NOT work. Wanted to replace old cables that usually work but occasionally have problems with fast charging, so I bought these. They dont fast charge and only trickle charge(I mean 12 hour estimate to charge 21%) when tightly held in place. Went back and plugged in old charger and received immediate fast charge notification so I KNOW it's the cables. Really wish amazon would purge these sellers that falsely advertise their product from the platform, this is the second seller and a total of 9 charging cables I have gone through searching for any that will work even as well as my current degrading cables."
4370,1,"These cables do not work. I bought them to have extra at work and home, but when it finally came time to use one it did not allow me to transfer any pictures to my PC. Our IT guy at work said it is probably a charging only cord, which I didn't even know there was such a thing. Regardless, I have tried to use it several times for charging and it does not work at all. I finally threw it in the trash can today. I don't know if it is just this one cord, or if the one at home is trash as well. Since it was a 2 pack and I bought them as extras, we have never used the on at home. But I don't care, They are junk! DO NOT BUY."
4371,3,"I used this cable bedside for nightly phone charging. I often use the phone will plugged in just before bed and when waking up while the phone is plugged in. After about 45 days of use, I started getting a ""slow charging"" notification every couple minutes. While the cable itself seems very durable, the connection seems bad. Fortunately it didn't impact the phone as other cables do not have this issue. Although they seem to be a quality cable in many aspects, the cable is only as good as it's weakest feature and switching back and forth from slow to fast charging is a weakness that takes over all the other qualities."
4372,1,"Update review: one of the two cables stopped working after about 3 months.The usb-c connector is not an exact match. When plugging into my Galaxy S9, it takes a lot of effort to push it in. Makes me feel like I'm doing a little damage each time I have to connect it. The OEM cable provided with the phone is a smooth but snug fit with an almost click feeling when connected. This cord feels like I'm forcing it.The cable looks great, feel durable and strong and such. But I wouldn't recommend."
4373,1,"I purchased this cable because i needed something that allowed me to use my phone withought me being stuck to an outlet. I also needed something that let me take advantage of the fast charge. The first 2 weeks was fine, everything worked great but then the cables slowly started to malfunction. I have to connect and disconnect the cable from my phone until the fast charge turns on otherwise im stuck with slow charging wich can take anywhere from 30-3 hours to charge. Now it is permanently broken the cables only slow charge. Maby if the cables allowed me to charge at a normal rate i would not give it such a low rating. I know it is the cables because i have used other 3rd party cables and they worl fine. Stay away from these things. They might work out the box but wont last more than a month."
4374,2,"I got a brand called 'sunlite' and I replaced several bulbs in my kitchen. Soon after that I had to replace them again. I thought it was pretty short lifespan, so I changed them and marked the date. Sure enough, 2 weeks later, the lights are not working. I won't buy Sylvania equivalent light bulbs again. Only real, name brand bulbs for me!"
4375,1,"How do I give negative stars?I thought I was doing a good deed by buying LED bulbs. These flickered from day one, but they were in my basement and not used too often. Yesterday I turned on my basement lights and instead of them flickering, the light dropped so low you could hardly tell they were on. I turned off the lights and called my electrician. Eric came over and we went down to the basement. Still low light. Then all of a sudden the lights went so bright you could hardly see. 4 exploded. 4 just burnt out. 4 started to flicker. So far I have lost 1 TV, my AppleTV, and a microwave. The electricity in my kitchen was compromised and several of the basement sockets stopped working. The electricians are here today rewiring the basement lights and checking all the kitchen outlets. Saving the planet is costing me thousands of dollars.... So not worth it. So not cool. Thanks Sylvania. Great Job!"
4376,3,"Something in our neighborhood draws a large electrical load at times, causing old incandescent bulbs to flicker. We have not had this problem with CFs or Philips brand LEDs. This time I purchased these Sylvania bulbs as they were ever so slightly cheaper. That was a mistake. They flicker nearly as badly as incandescents do. In a house that does not suffer the issues that ours does the two brands would likely be interchangeable, but for us they're terrible."
4377,3,"Two problems:(1) the amazon description clearly states these are dimmable. The fine print on the bulbs clearly states that they are not to be used with dimmers. The bulb is correct, they flicker badly at any dim setting other than 0% or 100%.(2) there is a fair amount of variation in the color temperature from bulb to bulb. Seems like between about 2500k and 3000k. Not noticeable except in fixtures (such as a bathroom fixture) with several side by side. Not awesome, but not a show-stopper.Otherwise, build quality is really good, and they DO NOT FLICKER in on-off (i.e., non-dimmable) switches.Sadly I have to return as i need dimmables."
4378,3,"On opening the box, I found boxes labaled Sylvania, and Osram. On the bulbs themselves, there is an OSRAM logo, so they appear to be brand-name bulbs. The printed boxes look like normal consumer packaging, high quality printing, and although I have no idea what relationship may exist between Sylvania and Osram, I am comfortable that the products are well manufactured.There are reviews which claim these are fakes, and reviews which claim they flicker terribly. I do not know whether they are fakes, but mine do not flicker. All of them which I have so far installed are operating normally, and I will happily buy them again in the future.UPDATE: Just received my second order of 24. All of the bulbs from the first order are in service, and so far, so good. The first batch were Osram branded; this batch is Sylvania branded. At less than a dollar apiece, I am more than pleased."
4379,3,"On my 2018 MacBook pro, these adapters transmit both data and power to and from my external hard drive and my external DVD drive - but will NOT play a DVD movie on the external DVD player. Then I get an error message that my DVD player, which is set for Region 1, can't play Region 1 movies!! I substituted an actual Apple adapter cable and the DVD played the movie no problem. Obviously, these Syntec adapters are unable to correctly transmit DVD region information. For movies on a Mac, I suggest you get the Apple USB-C to USB adapter, even though it will set you back $19. If you are using another computer YMMV."
4380,3,wow a fast description name change!the description change after purchase. it claim to be a usb3 to thunderbolt adapter. No original mention of mac only complaint. No mention now of thunderbolt 2 or 3. This name change at least three times after the original description.Please be careful and print all description or take a photo of it on your photo on AMAZON. Description has changed with my purchases over the years. At least 5 times in the last 2years. Check out your initial watch items description.
4381,3,"My iPhone 6s, which has a new battery, hasn't held a charge since I got this adapter and used it to plug my phone into my new macbook pro. I did a factory reset of the phone and reinstalled everything, and my phone still drains about 8% an hour when on standby. Compared to less than 1% an hour a couple weeks ago.I contacted the company asking if they were familiar with the problem. They didn't respond, and refunded my order without me asking for it. Kind of sounds like culpability. I'm now trying to figure out how to get my phone fixed, or if I need to buy a new one."
4382,3,"Updated after a month or so of use. It doesn't work. Trying to charge my phone. Not impressed.Sending them back wouldn't be worth the money or time.Original Review:Right now I primarily use this for charging my phone via the computer. When my computer goes to sleep, the power connection to the phone dies. When I wake up my computer, the charge to the phone doesn't start up, so I need to unplug the USB adapter and plug it back in, then it starts charging again. Kinda a pain in the arse to have to do this every time.I'll see what happens when I use this adapter with other devices. Hopefully I won't have the same issue.In summary, I'm not impressed. Does it work? Yes. Does it work well? Not really. I just started using it, so maybe I'll figure something out where it doesn't stop charging."
4383,3,"The producer functionally works decently enough to manage, however I was very disappointed when I found out I could not use more than one on each side of my MacBook Pro to accommodate the four lightning ports available. As a music producer, DJ and photographer/videographer this is a huge downfall for not being able to connect four devices. When I DJ I use three ports almost every time due to the controller connection, music storage connection, and power supply if the night is going to be long."
4384,2,"The fact that I have to expose my address, phone number, and passwords to a foreign national company to make the device work was not part of the deal. As soon as I started to read the ridiculously unintelligible instructions, and downloaded the app I realized what private data that I would be REQUIRED to expose. If you read the fine print, it is very clear that they can do whatever they want with your private data to include selling it to a third-party. I chose not to do that I will be sending them back. I cannot speak on how they work because I would never, ever, under any circumstances expose my network security to this device or use this app. At the end of the day I will simply flip the light switch."
4385,2,"I bought 12 of these to remotely control the Christmas lights in the house. I've been using them daily for the past 30 days.Pros: Alexa integration works well.Cons: Setting them up was a little glitchy but it eventually worked. Like I said I've been using them everyday for the past month to turn the Christmas lights on and off and about every three days 4 to 8 of them don't work. They work fine for several days and then a bunch of them get disconnected from the network. They are unresponsive in the Smart Life app as well as Alexa. I have to unplug them and plug them back in and then they work for a couple more days. It seems to happen randomly across all 12 plugs. Its not like one location has bad wifi reception and that plug always fails. Every single one of the plugs has not worked and I've had to unplug them and plug them back in. It really defeats the point of home automation.I would not buy these again, even if they are much cheaper than competing products."
4386,2,"I originally was set to purchase the amazon smart plug. I saw these and read the description. It stated it works with Alexa. it seemed like a no brainer 4 for just a couple of dollars more. I am a reader and I like to read a book as I am lying in bed. I was looking for a smart plug that I could verbally command my end table light to turn on and off so I do not have to roll and reach over to turn off. When I am ready to fall asleep. These Smart plugs come with an app you download and it works well when you use them with the Go Smart app. However, it requires that you enable the Go Smart Skill in the Alexa skills settings and it never worked after a considerable time I just got tired of trying to make these devices work with my Alexa as stated. it never recognized even after The Go smart skill was enabled. Icoulduse the Go Smart app and it would work. But it is much easier to just roll over and turn off the lamp manually. Then to grab my Iphone, access the G smart app and now turn off the lamp using the app. Really ? sent it back and purchased the Amazon smart plug. Bada Bing Bada Boom done , finito."
4387,3,"I liked the ease of getting the product to connect in the app, was a breeze. Was nice to get some lights on a schedule as well. The bad part? Our neighborhood lost power for 3 hours, the dang things never reconnected to the app. We tried to tell the app to forget the devices and start over. We deleted the app, reinstalled it. We followed the apps troubleshooting. We followed not one or two, but MANY forums that had threads of troubleshooting. NOTHING WORKED! It's like you connect them once, and hope they stay connected or they'll never connect again. I tried to contact the company on their own pages, NOT in Amazon, and no one ever responded. Gave up trying to get these things to connect. You'd think a support technician of 20+ years could figure these things out, but after trying every possible idea and thought, they're impossible to work with. I've found from many other complaints people stated the same or similar issues. One guy mentioned he even opened them up, jumped them to clear its memory cache and still didn't work. I never tried that, but good to know some people went that far and still can't get them to come back to life."
4388,3,"This definitely wasn't my first load of pumpkins having started off teaching computer applications in the MS-DOS days and progressing through various operating systems, so it's not a lack of knowledge that kept the plugs from being recognized, it was basically either a poorly designed app OR weak/sub-par WiFi recognition. I even tried one in the same room as my router, put my phone exclusively on WiFi, and the app still couldn't identify the plug.Echo and Alexa are exclusive to Amazon--can Amazon not make a few plugs that will connect to Echo without me needing an Echo, a Kindle Fire, AND an Android or iPhone? In order to get these plugs working, I had to have the Echo, a Kindle Fire, and an Android device. I was surprised I didn't have to turn on the microwave and start the car."
4389,3,"Mine was a little dried out on arrival; chalky but still useable. I applied it to a leather knife strop. I notice little, if any difference between a 'loaded' strop and bare. Tried several different blade types. I realize that this is just a fine tuning addition to the strop and that you don't need that much. It just simply didn't make a lot of difference IMO for the blades I tried: Chef knife, slicer, sushi knife, pocket knife. The sharpening is mostly done in the other stages."
4390,3,"I haven't used it yet, so can't comment on quality, but my bar was both smaller than I expected and noticeably smaller than the ones in other reviewers' photos. (My bar does look like the product page photos.) Curious, I weighed it and found it to be about 15oz. The bar seems mass-cut, not just eye-balled and whacked off a larger piece, so it seems likely that others are getting the smaller bar as well.The difference isn't worth having a back-and-forth with the seller about it, but short-changing customers is maybe the first thing to avoid as a seller."

One side works like magic the other doesn’t work at all.. so your basically paying to use one side since the other side doesn’t actually get used. Unless I was given a faulty product but too lazy to return it and already used the one side. Also difficult to clean I won’t be able to use it more than three or four times since getting lint or cat hair out is not as easy as all the other reviews are making it sound.
Wouldn’t recommend product."
4392,1,"I purchased this product believing it would put a fine finishing hone on my various knife blades as the final step following the use of sharpening stones. When put to the test, it missed the mark considerably leaving my blades with a far duller edge then I obtained with just the use of sharpening stones. Perhaps it was the way I used the product. You tell me....To use the compound I applied a thin layer of it on to a leather strop and stroked the knife blade in a back and forth motion (pulling the knife with the non-blade edge in front) along the length of the strop at approximately a 20% angle. I repeated the process so that both sides of the knife edge had equal strokes. No matter how often I attempted this, the blade would lose its edge and fail the simple paper cut test. In comparison, I found that using the strop without any compound at all worked much better in giving the blade a sharper edge. My advice is stay away from this cheap imitation."
4393,3,"The compounds was probably really nice about 5 years ago.... You can still use them if you are willing to melt it down. I put a chunk of it in glass on the stove with some veg oil and make an abrasive paste out of it for use. Performance of the abrasive is very good for achieving a polished edge on knives. However, thanks to the poor overall handling on amazon's part (very stale product, not packed well at all), this is a lot more trouble than it's worth. (This was a prime order but I don't recall 100% if amazon stocked the item)."
4394,3,"Quit working after 5 months. Buy a different phone system. This phone was purchased December 20,2017. It quit working around the middle of April. I need to return it as I think it should have lasted longer that that. The deadline for the return was in January 31, 2018. Reading all the positive reviews, makes me thing that this phone is defective and should have lasted longer. I can't find any contact information to report this situation, except write a review. I think it should have be in warranty for at least 1 year."
4395,3,"I've had several great AT&T phones over the years, this was not one of them.All the reviews talk about is blah blah call blocking but none mentioned the horrible sound quality during a call. The other end of the phone conversation said it sounded mostly ok with some echo but on my end there was a terrible echo and a distorted rattle like there was a loose piece of aluminum foil over the speaker. Not acceptable for me. Submitting a refund and will likely get another VTech."
4396,1,"The call screening is horrible. I live in 702 area code and any phone number that has 702 comes through without challenge it says Nevada call. Any solicitors calling from area code 702 and other people I don't want to talk to don't have to go through the system of saying their name because the caller ID says Nevada call. This phone system arrived when my husband ended up in the hospital on life support. I came home from the hospital, set up the greeting but was gone from home for most of the month. Now that he is home we are having a worse time with this phone system than we did with our old one. I wish I had never bought it. I'm so sorry the 30 day return deadline is past. I would ship it back in a flash. It is horrible!!! Do not buy this phone!!!"
4397,3,"I got this phone for my mother primarily for the ability to screen out nuisance calls and in that regard it was WONDERFUL. However eight months on the base unit has limited functionality - it connects to the handsets, I can set time/date, the find handset function works but the CID, the phone book, the ability to block calls... all have suddenly ceased. I have reset the handsets and power cycled the base but no change. I am in the proces of trying to find a procedure to hard reset the base but have yet to find one. All I can say is this is a terrific phone when it works, kind of a doorstop when it doesn't.I contacted AT&T customer support and had a very circuitous troubleshooting session that was not addressing the issues I was having with the phone system. Maybe she could not understand what I was trying to tell her, we both had an issue with that, but in the end when she finally determined that the phone would need to be returned she began telling me how to package it, send it via UPS (or other), and when it became obvious to me that there would be no replacement coming BEFORE I sent the broken phone back our talks ended. A phone is necessary 24-7, especially in a cancer patients home, and I can not wait around for a replacement for my mothers phone for who knows how long. I will be looking for a non-AT&T/V-Tech replacement for this."
4398,1,"I have been buying and using AT&T phones and phone systems for my office and home for 30 years. This system is absolutely the worst I have ever purchased. The handset ""freezes"" and when the phone rings and you try to answer it, nothing.... and the phone just keeps ringing in another room. We've removed the battery a few times, tried a few things, but the system was less than 3 months old when it started experiencing failures like this and right now, the phone in one handset isn't working again. The name AT&T used to assure me of quality and reliability. No more, it seems.Save your money and your time, and get another system."
4399,3,"Ordered this set Sept of 2018 worked fine until i started getting Static from the base unit. I thought it was the phone co, sincre I had this problem with them before. After checking other cordless phones I had, it turned out to be the Vtech Base causing the static. I had another set from Vtech and they lasted 9 years until the hand sets stopped regisetering with the base.so that's why I ordered another Vtech set. Didnt work out too well this time. Amazon said ordeer had passed the return time. I tried cpontacting Vtechphones.com but kept me in loop so I gave up. Anyway Id like a refund since ive aleady order a diff set from AT&T hoping this will work out better."
4400,3,"I purchased this product in late April 2018. I received it and set it up according to the instructions. I couldn't get it to work after trying everything I knew to try. My phone carrier service is provided buy Consumer Cellular. I have called then numerous times for assistance, The first time I was told that CC uses ATT cell towers and they were having problems with some towers in my geographic area. I was told to wait 10 days to 2 weeks and call them back if the problem hadn't resolved itself. It didn't....so I called them back. I got another rep who tried numerous things that didn't work. I was told a supervisor would contact me when available to help me resolve the problem. A few days later the supervisor called me back and walked me though the installation process for the phone. Everything was set up correctly. She sent signals that for some unknown reason were not being received by the phone. I still didn't have a dial tone, and I've never gotten a dial tone. She told me she was going to look in to the problem a little more and see if she could come up with anything. I got a call back from them (CC) and was told that the VTech phone was ""not compatible"" with Consumer Cellular's service! Who knows this? i didn't know and neither did CC apparently. Now I'm being told it's too late to return or do something with this phone. Can someone please help me with this, I would really appreciate it!Thank you."
4401,3,"The phone itself is great, but the ""brand new"" batteries were bad, did not charge in 24 hours, and ran out after a few minutes. After several heated arguments with the phone company (via email) over getting a ""line in use"" message and no dial tone, it sank in that the batteries were useless. I didn't want to return the whole phone, as the next one might be the same way, so I spent much time researching batteries. RESULTS: (1) The batteries that come with the VTech have a short cord that fits easily, while the replacement cord is too long and hard to stuff into the case. (2) Talking to different vendors and comparing ""compatible"" batteries, I learned that several 2.4V batteries will work in this phone: 300, 400, 600, or 750mAh, the difference being the capacity or duration of the charge according to one vendor (I'm not an electrician, so if in doubt do your own research.) (3) The batteries that came with my NEW CS6529 phone were only 300 mAh. (4) The VTech factory outlet offers a 2-pack with 750mAh for $29.95 plus shipping, no mention of origin. My final purchase on Amazon Prime: iMa Ryme offers a 2-pack with 600mAh with the proper short cords for $6.95, made in China. So much stress over two little batteries!"
4402,2,"This phone is the worst. I would give it no stars, but you must provide at least a one star rating...It is poorly made, has lousy audio and a weak directory. I have owned both V-Techs and Panasonics over the years, and the Panasonic is more capable, has better audio, especially on speaker phone, and is more durable. The Panasonic has a neat feature that announces the caller based on the caller ID, so you don't have to waste your time even picking up unwanted calls. It also has better blocking capability for robocalls and the like.Specific things I dislike about the V-Tech...the directory list of recent calls is limited to only 50. On top of that, the phone often fails to update a call. I have repeatedly picked up just after missing a call (coming in from the garden, etc.) and it does not display the number of the missed caller.The speaker audio is just not good. I have trouble hearing people when I use the hands free speaker.One of the phones broke within a five months . . . I could not hang up a call as the ""off"" (hand up button) did not hang up the call . I had to pull the battery to hang up the phone.Here is a link to the Panasonic: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HXMJ14S/ref=psdc_172614_rv_t2_B00WHYS0R2(Note there is also a blue tooth Panasonic that will link with mobile phones.)"
4403,3,"What does that have to do with something you listen to? My wife and I are not spring chickens. The display on the handsets is so small as to be almost impossible to read. The only reason we decided to buy new phones and retire our not too old Panasonics had to do with a problem that turned out to be due to some other cause that as of yet is undetermined.Caller ID for the Panasonic displays on the TV making it even more user friendly.Both units have a lot of options, most of which we'll never use but since most of them have to do with software programming no expense is saved by not having them available.I guess this is a review of both phone sets, the V-tech purchased from Amazon, the Panasonic from Walmart. The clear winner for us is the Panasonic, which we have re-connected and are using."
4404,3,"The phone hand set keeps telling me I have a voice mail. I do not have voice mail service. I have put it on voice mail service OFF about 20 or 30 times. I want the time to show, not voice mail. There is no phone number to call to get help with the product. When I got to the web sight it says to hold # until there is a beep. That works for about 5 minutes and than the message is back. The phone is light and cheep. The handset falls off the charger all the time. I ordered another brand a month ago and sent it back for the same reasons. Where is Radio Shack when you need them.? About a month later I got fed up and contacted Panasonic. They want to charge me solve the problem. That is so not right."
4405,2,"Should have returned this at the first sign of trouble. The time on the phones consistently reset to a time of its choosing. Tried to set an accurate time multiple times, but within a few hours the time always reverted to Panasonic Standard Time (a completely wrong time). I just let it slide because the time on the landline phone was not that important to me.Now, about 2-1/2 months after installing, I can’t answer incoming calls. The phone rings, I pick it up, I get a busy signal. I disconnect and connect again, and if I do that quickly enough I can speak with the person who is ringing.I plan to avoid Panasonic altogether in the future. This purchase was to replace another Panasonic multi-phone set that randomly disconnected calls mid-sentence. At least that unit lasted a few years..."
4406,3,"I purchased this to replace my old phone that had been functioning fine except the display screen stopped working. I know my phone lines are fine, but this phone would show error messages saying the base wasn't connected to the phone line (it was). Also, about 15-30 minutes into any call, the call just drops. This has been very frustrating when making calls to customer service for other issues/companies and every time I start talking to a rep, the call drops.These phones are terrible."
4407,2,"Who's giving this phone 4 and 5 stars?????? Not the quality Panasonic company you knew. The remote charger stopped charging just after the return period (60 days). Panasonic wants me to ship the charger to Texas repair center. It weighs about the same as an empty envelope (read cheap Malaysia crap). The weight of the power cord will pull the empty charger/stand off the table.I tried emailing support. no success. I tried calling, was told to go on-line. I went to shop Panasonic to just buy a replacement, out of stock. Volume low, always use speaker phone. Guess I will buy another brand of phone.."
4408,3,"Its a real pain to place this phone in the base. You have to be precise and careful. I end up dropping the phone alot and get frustrated. The caller id also stops working for me everytime I pull the phone from the base. Even if I am extra careful not to disturb any wires. I think something is wrong with it. To get caller id I back I have to reset the phone. then caller id works perfectly until the moment I use the handheld phone again. Ugh.One goodthing is the battery lasts long and the distance/range is great. But I bought the phone for caller id.UPDATE: I fixed the caller id by using a longer wire and splitting it between another phone. but now the receiver suddenly died. Almost exactly a year after purchase. Had 4 bars. Then suddenly shut off and won't charge or turn on. Customer service is no existent. Live chat stuck on ""connecting to agent"" and on hold on phone for hours. I gave up."
4409,3,"This POS phone had a broken Wi-Fi antenna. I set it up before I left the US but didn't realize that the Wi-Fi only connected because I was in the same room as the router. I put it back in the box and into my luggage. When I got back to Vietnam and gave it to my girlfriend, she had problems connecting to Wi-Fi almost immediately. After a month of hearing about it, we took the phone to an Apple-authorized repair facility where they told us that the case had been almost imperceptibly bent and the Wi-Fi antenna broken. I cannot return it because I'm still in Vietnam--it's sitting in a drawer where it will stay until we need to scavenge it for parts. If the vendor is really certified to refurbish, they should have known the Wi-Fi antenna was broken."
4410,1,"Tried to insert SIM card to use phone and it would not connect to the cell network for T-Mobile. Took the phone into 2 different T-Mobile stores and called the T-Mobile customer service line to troubleshoot. When I called the T-Mobile they said the IMEI number was incorrect for the phone, which I thought was just because she had heard it wrong. Then after visiting the second T-Mobile store to look at other phones and troubleshoot my current phone the T-Mobile associate informed me the phone was probably a fake due to the appearance of the phone. Phone stickers said Verizon network when it was received as well with a big black dot sticker trying to cover that up. BEWARE OF FAKE IPHONES BEING SOLD HERE!!!"
4411,2,"I bought this phone in July 2016. As of this past week, it has stopped working altogether. I contacted the seller for assistance, and because more than 90 days had past - there was nothing they could do. I tried working with Apple to troubleshoot to no avail. I'm not even able to restore the phone to factory defaults using iTunes because of the error messages. Right now, the phone won't even turn on. At the time I purchased the phone, it was listed as a ""certified refurbished"" product. After paying nearly $400, I would like to think that the phone should last at least a few years. I just purchased a brand new iPhone directly from an AT&T store and hope for better luck. I will never trust ""certified refurbished"" again."
4412,1,"I like apple. I like text replacement and certain apps I am able to get. I DO NOT like receiving a phone I paid so much for that DOESNT EVEN WORK AS A PHONE. I didn’t order an iPod Touch. I ordered a phone. The caller cannot hear the recipient and the recipient cannot hear the caller. The touch screen is faulty where you have to keep touching to make something work. It will only stay connected to metro for a short time and so if I go anywhere other than home this little box is useless. To top it all off I work off my phone, and I’m losing time because of your carelessness. I’ve never had trouble with phones from Groupon. Don’t put a “certified refurbished “ ticket in boxes if you have not tested the product personally. I’ve never been so mad. I love amazon but you can probably guess you won’t be receiving $13 a month from me anymore.The man I spoke to last night barely spoke English, didn’t are about customer service, but um hi, without us customers y’all would not be getting paid. You should consider treating us better with care and products that work."
4413,3,"My phone has gone, just after 2 months of use. The first month was pretty good, the machine was hotter than usual but still good. From the second month, the bad thing happened to the battery and the power, the touch was not good and the screen was open. After buying a week, I left the US for a long vacation and could not do more than see my phone dying. Actually, In fact can not live even 60 days.I thought the battery was problematic. After returning to the US, I went to Apple Store yesterday and they checked it. The technician told me that it was not the battery problem, the battery was still working fine, but hardware have a big deal, the cost to fix it $299 + Tax (Equivalent to the amount I bought this phone!). Now it's just like a paperweight, no more.The first time I bought a refurbished phone is also the last one. Thank you!"
4414,1,"This is ridiculous. I was so excited to get my new phone, an upgrade from my iPhone. I read some great things in reviews but should’ve paid attention to the bad.Firstly, this is not the same phone!!! I ordered a Samsung Galaxy S8. This is a Samsung Galaxy S8 ACTIVE, a completely different phone. I grabbed it out of the box and it is so sticky!!! I had to wash my hands. Also, it has been a half hour and I just got to ten percent battery, and as soon as it’s unplugged, it drops charge FAST. Another thing, this is a T-Mobile phone; looks like one of those phones they use for display, except it’s disgusting. It has very obvious signs of wear and tear all over the sides. I had to press very hard to just open the phone.Now that I’m finally able to reset it again (since I entered my email and wanted it out of the phone), it is taking a long time to load back up. I’m not sure it will.Moral of the story: don’t buy phones from third parties you’ve never heard of. Look away! This is a scam!!!"
4415,3,"Phone dead within 6 months. No response from the company that did the refurbishing. I did reach out a couple of times. Verizon can not help you if you buy from outside Verizon. My previous review: This phone arrived and works perfectly except for one flaw - the video call feature does not work. I am being told that a switch is missing? That the seller needs to activate or add it somehow? One of the MAIN reasons why I bought this phone for my son, is so I can video call my kids without having to go through their father. Any ideas?"
4416,3,"This was advertised as a phone unlocked and usable with the AT&T network. The description specifically stated that it was not compatible with Verizon SIM cards. The phone that arrived was a Verizon locked phone. I call Amazon to see where the communication break down was because I was quite frustrated. They said that these phones are not refurbished by them, so they are not sure what happened. They said that this is not a common issue. I was upset again to hear that a phone advertised as an Amazon refurbished product is not actually refurbished by Amazon or shipped by Amazon. It's very frustrating. I couldn't find another one in this price range that was AT&T unlocked so I forked over the extra few hundred dollars to get a brand new one."
4417,1,"After receiving the phone 4 days late because the seller did not hand it over to ups until the day I was guaranteed delivery, I put my T-Mobile SIM in and started it up and was greeted with the message attached photo. After fully starting up and going to initial setup, I got the message ""the Sim card you inserted is not a Verizon wireless Sim. Please insert a Verizon Sim card to continue setup""This phone is in the headline and description as 'Unlocked' but they are not! These phones are tethered to a network that may not be your desired one. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU EXPECT AN UNLOCKED PHONE!!Seller would get 0 stars if Amazon allowed it!"
4418,1,"I bought this phone to use with my prepaid phone plan through Net10, as this phone was labeled factory unlocked GSM phone. The phone would NOT work with any SIM card I purchased. I spent hours trying to figure out a way to make the phone work. Every time a SIM card was inserted I got a notification that said ""network locked."" My phone was apparently locked in to T-Mobile, but I even purchased a T-Mobile SIM card which still would not work. I paid money to have my phone factory UNLOCKED which still resulted in it not working with any SIM card inserted. The phone showed I had full bars but I could not make any phone calls or texts. The phone came in great shape, everything was functioning on the phone except for me not being able to use it no matter what, I could only use this phone with wifi. Net10 told me my SIM card was activated for this phone, but the phone just wouldn't take the SIM card. I also went to Verizon and spoke with someone who tried to get it activated through them, and the phone would still not work. Be careful buying phones that say unlocked because there's a good chance it may not be. Also this is a refurbished phone as well, so that may have been part of the issue too?"
4419,2,"So, I'll start out the review with the only positive this phone has, the screen.I'm not sure why, but the screen on this device is really good for my standards, at least for a $70 phone. When I turn up the brightness the screen feels incredibly sharp and vibrant.Now, onto the bad parts of this phone.Everything else on this phone is terrible, and I'm not exactly sure why.We'll start with the most glaring of issues, the speed of the phone itself.I've never had a phone act slower than this one, straight out of the box and this device is UNBELIEVABLY SLOW. I cannot turn on YouTube and watch a video on it because whatever video I play will lag and drop frames. It isn't exclusive to YouTube either. Snapchat and a messaging app I use called Telegram basically cannot play any videos whatsoever without the phone stuttering and lagging. I can't even RECORD videos on the phone because the device fails to. When I start recording the phone starts dropping frames and stuttering, the final straw, and what made me write this review, happened when I tried to send someone a message, typed it out on the keyboard, and it took the phone a minute and a half to finish writing said message. It was 40 letters long. The performance on this phone is absolutely terrible.The battery life is also not great either. I use it pretty lightly throughout the day and it'll last be until I get home. But if I NEED to call anyone for any extended period of time, or use my GPS I can almost promise it'll die within an hour or two.I also had defects on the phone as soon as I got it, but was willing to deal with them because I could acknowledge that it was kind of an inexpensive phone. But there's an issue when your headphone jack basically freaks out and only works with one channel of the head phone unless you put the plug in at EXACTLY the right way. This lead to some embarrassing moments in my college class where I was trying to listen to some music and the phone decided to route the audio to the phone speaker and play it for the entire class.Honestly, I'm REALLY disappointed by this. Blu is the brand that got me into lesser-known flagship killer-esc phones. As soon as I broke my first Blue R1 HD I bought two more from Blu because it was such a solid phone. But now they're charging MORE for this device which is an inferior product all together, and lacks some of the horribly glaring issues that the Studio Mega has. Blu has literally worked backwards. I've owned the phone since the end of Feburary and I'm already thinking about buying another phone (Probably a Xiaomi or a Huawei) because I just don't want to deal with the technical errors, horrible battery life, and absolutely TERRIBLE performance of this phone.Honestly, at $70, I feel almost ripped off. And chances are I'll never buy another Blu ever again."
4420,3,"Android Oreo Go is a pathetic platform is a data hog. I loved my Blu Life XL, and this is a similar top of the line big screen phone, but Oreo is not Lollipop and nothing on it works unless you have a fast wifi connection, And the huge battery only lasts a few hrs, compare that with 2 days on my old phone. I can't answer a call, because I do not get an answer or hangup widget. There are no widgets at all on this phone. The camera does nothing but crash and it won't do video, or download all of my email, despite all the beautiful specs on this phone. How do I get a better OS? I have the recommended 32GB sd card. I have reset it many times and thrown off all Go apps that seem to just eat up battery life. Anyone? Please?"
4421,2,"This phone is a good phone for the price! However, the sellers falsely advertise the components of this product by indicating that it comes with a clear case. The picture listed with this product implies that the case sent is completely clear however these cases come with weird designs on them. When I contacted the seller regarding this issue and asking if they would allow me to exchange them for clear cases I was just told that this phone comes with assorted cases. If I saw that in the description, picture, or title I wouldn't complain. Also, in the reviews, people had clear cases! I don't understand why I received multiple phones without this clear case. I did not see that in the description and they offered me no help at all. I would go to a different seller and that is what I plan on doing when purchasing more of these. If there is a bigger problem with your phone they probably won't help you out. They can't even answer all questions asked in a short message!"
4422,3,"Who makes a phone in 2018 that only does 3G?? At least make that clear when you write the description. But you fool people with phrases like, ""The STUDIO MEGA 2018 is powered by an efficient 1.3GHz Quad Core processor. Breeze through all your task's seamlessly and download the latest video or game for endless entertainment. "" Or, ""Android 8.1 Go Edition a powerful experience for entry-level smartphones. It's the best of Android, built with re-imagined apps..."" No one in their right mind would purchase this phone if they were told, ""This phone is only as fast as 3G service, which we understand, as of 2000, is unacceptable in this age of LTE service."" So, yea, I'm returning this phone."
4423,3,The phone is very slow and laggy just scrolling up down left right is laggyInternet is especial on youtube even on 4g this phone can get 4gTouch screen is sensitive and sometimes wont register my many touches fingerprint sensor too. The volume is quite low at max volume. I keep my brightness low for extended battery life but its useless it wont last a work shift. Im not big phone user im not constantly looking down i only install 3/4 apps for reading and listening to my music i dont stream or use a lot of data im a simple phone user .the one good thing is the 'go apps' are really fast and responsive everything else slow and laggy i would return it but its to cheap to pass up.
4424,1,It lasted one day. It stop working by the next day. It looks cheap. I thought it was going to be more durable and a bit more animated but it totally wasn’t. The so call touch screen buttons don’t work unless you press the middle button which makes the whole phone light up and make noise. I wanted my 15month old to be able to have fun with the buttons without the extra noise. He pretty much figured the toy out and hated the extra noise as much as I did. Wouldn’t buy it again or recommend it at all. Wasted money.
4425,2,"Ok so AT FIRST, I loved this. Did exactly what I wanted distracted the 18 month old from taking my phone because she had her own. It lite up and made noise and was everything I was hoping for. HOWEVER saying it's not moisture proof is an understatement, I was thinking like don't leave it in a steamy bathroom. No. 18 month olds tend to put things in their mouth, that's all it takes to totally ruin this thing. It shorts out to the point where the power bottom won't work, or starts flickering in and out uncontrollably, the charging port gives out AND WORSE PART THE INSIDE STARTED TO GROW MOLD. Way to dangerous to allow her to keep playing with it, this after only 2 weeks, maybe ok for a slightly older preschool aged child but 18 months is not even close."
4426,3,"I was excited to get this for my little one.. thought it was like a phone with a touch screen display and maybe a few apps.. it's a cheap piece of plastic with a sticker of apps and some lights in it. Very disappointed! The ""buttons"" don't even function correctly. It comes with a standard warning it may sizzle and not work!!? I will not take the chance with this made in China hazard. Amazon shouldn't allow products like this to be sold!"
4427,1,This product is a waste of money. It is a cheaply made plastic phone that stops working and when you plug it in to charge it really doesn’t charge. I unplugged it after 3 hours and it still did not turn on. My 1 year old granddaughter pressed every button and it did nothing. She left it alone and 15 minutes later it started going off on its own. Worked for about 10 minutes and then nothing again. It just randomly goes off but never works when she goes to play with it. I would recommend no one buy this as it is very cheaply made.
4428,1,"LESS than 1 star!!! As soon as I opened the package, I realized I completely messed up thinking this would be safe for infants. I guess I didn't read the description well but this thing is NOT safe and will NOT be giving it to my 9mo old. He LOVES cell phones but the instructions even describe a ""sizzle"" sound. It already looks like it will shock my child. Directly to the trash it goes. I cannot return it bc the shipping costs the same as the toy. Lesson Learned. FYI, AMAZON should really take the garbage off their website out of common sense for safety of children. I wouldn't even trust my 5yr old with it. Total garbage."
4429,3,"I'm 5'7"" 200 lbs and in leggings and other biker shorts I'm always a large. i have muscular legs and carry all my weight in my stomach. these were SO SMALL. the elastic around the bottom is tighter than the rest of the shorts and it cut into my limited thigh fat. major camel toe and EXTREMELY see through. I bent down and could see my actually butt crack lol! I wont be exchanging for a larger size just because of the fit. shorts definitely made for petite girls.... even though these should be made for larger girls who have chub rub!"
4430,1,"Buyer beware. I don't understand understand how these have such rave reviews. I always scour the review section before purchasing anything on Amazon, so I'm surprised that I was let down.These Yoga shorts are terrible quality. The waistband doesn't ""stretch"" as described, and there's a strange lining in it that when trying to pull over my hips began to make a ripping sound. I've bought yoga pants from ALL OVER and these are the only ones that don't have that nice stretchy quality. If you're not a stick figure and have some butt/thighs/hips to work with, these shorts aren't happening.I'm 5'8"" 150, and have been a medium in every single pair of yoga pants or shorts that I've bought from multiple vendors. I followed the size chart and other reviews here and bought a medium. Could barely get them up my thighs.The overall polyester material of the shorts feels cheap and smelled funny out of the package. This is some cheap Chinese crap - you'd be better off spending your money on quality products made in the USA."
4431,2,"I was so excited to receive these exercise shorts. The pictures looked great, the reviews excellent, everything I was looking for. I just got these Friday and they are not what was pictured or advertised. They came in a plain bag with a very generic labeling. I took the shorts out and they did not look at all like the photos. The waist band is a basic piece of thick elastic band about a half inch wide sewn into very thin cheap silky-ish fabric. The elastic is actually warping the waist because it seems a bit too long for the fabric itself. Next, THERE IS NO BRAND NAME ON THESE SHORTS. None. None at all. It’s like these originated from a dollar store. There is a white tag that says M and “made in China”. The fabric is not thick at all. The seams are off resulting in huge wedgies and camel toes. Yes, I did get the proper size! I figured I would give these a chance even with the weird generic packaging and no brand name on them, so here comes the big reveal...the try on.YIKES!!!! Upon just pulling them on, I heard several stitches popping. Okay. Not great. I got them on, the legs around where the leg elastic is are too tight around but the leg part itself is comfortable. Also, these are not high waisted at all. They come about halfway between my navel and my crotch area. Ok, maybe I just have to break them in? Wore them so go easy walking this morning at the park and upon my first quick walk, run, the legs started riding up until they looked like exercise panties.These are not good. I don’t know what I got, but these WERE NOT the item that was advertised and pictured. Poor quality, broken stitches, not a brand label in sight. Paper thin flimsy material. They definitely did not send the item pictured! Huge disappointment."
4432,3,I'm so upset disappointed and was totally embarrassed.....I got them I was so excited....did a test run 2 miles ok cool......so this morning I get them to run a half marathon.....telling the girls all about them .. they really liked them .....ok now this is the sad part <U+0001F620><U+0001F620><U+0001F620>I'm at mile 4 something didn't feel right ...jumped into a Porta Jon.....they had ripped in the crotch....that good someone Dutch a long sleeve shirt ...I had to wrap it around me so I could keep running ....by the time I was done it was a 3 inch rip down there ..sorry but no star from me.
4433,3,"I bought 2 pairs of these. Black pair was in original plastic with tag. Blue pair was a repackage with no tag. I opened the plastic & the strong odor of FISH hit me in the face! Crotch stank to high heaven. Someone clearly wore them and either had bad hygiene or sweat a lot and then returned them. I contacted the seller and they apologized but couldn't do anything as it was fulfilled by Amazon. So, I returned both pair because that is just unacceptable. I am afraid to re-order as I might get the same rancid shorts back. So disappointed. I use Amazon for pretty much everything but groceries and this is the 3rd time I've gotten something that was obviously a return. The other two had things like a chewed up tag or animal hair on it. I can deal with that, but someone else's stink is just unsanitary.I did try on the new ones (WITH UNDERWEAR) and they do not cover the bellybutton. I am a curvy size 10 with a short torso and sized up/got the XL based on reviews. They fit super comfortably but were not true high waist."
4434,3,I wanted to order these to wear to Disney so I was going to buy like 5 pairs but I wanted to try one out first. When these came in and I opened the ablaze I could immediately tell that the material was horrid. I could tell it was going to cause sweat and stuff was going to stick to it. Then I put them on and they were cut off at the wrong spot they needed to go about an inch further and then they would hug or feel small. I returned because I felt like they were squeezing my legs and was not flattering.
4435,3,"I’m 5’10 and about 205 pounds carrying most of my weight in my tummy. I purchased and xl like I typically do and this fit great.I love that the waist goes above my belly button and holds in all of my muffin top and belly bulge. Even when I am going on light jogs it stays up!!!! I almost never find myself adjusting and pulling them back up.I use these several times a week during my workouts or when I’m deep cleaning. They are very comfortable. Never left with a red mark around my waist. They are stretchy yet form fitting.I will be purchasing more since I love the longer length (no chub rub with this length), non shiny fabric and the high waist (above be belly button). However, I do get the tiny fabric balls on inner thigh area after a few times wearing them so I’m only giving them 3 stars. They start to shabby after several uses so while great for working out I wouldn’t wear these out and about in public unless brand new."
4436,3,"I just took these out for my first run. I was very excited because my Galaxy phone easily fit into the side pocket. I would like something a little less stiff in the fabric, but I figured it was worth the price. About 3 miles in I realized I was chafing at the very top, back to inner part of my thigh. I thought it was skin-on-skin so I tried adjusting the pants several times during my run. Once I got back I realized it was on both sides and appears to line up with the seam of the pants.I will probably give them another try after the spots have recovered and on a shorter run, but my initial verdict is that I can't wear them to run in, which was why I bought them."
4437,1,Now that the weather started warming up I finally pulled out these shorts to wear them and I have to tell you I have so disappointed. I was a huge fan of these shorts and purchased the large first and loved them so much I purchased another pair in size XL in hopes it would be a little more high wasted. It wasn't until recently that I started wearing them and realized they are completely different than the size large. The large was a great quality short and great material. The XL material was SUPER thin and didn't even have the brand Baleaf on them. It felt like a complete scam. Of course now that I realized that I had hoped to email the seller but it looks like the refund just came up. Don't sell an XL if you don't have the same quality control on them as your other sizes. A complete fraud.
4438,3,"I bought both a medium and a large. When I looked at the first pair, I knew they wouldn't fit. I tried on the medium and they were awful. So I kept the large. I am 5'6"" and 155 pounds give or take a few pounds either way. I wore the large on a walk on a hot day and they made me feel like I was wrapped in cellophane. I was so hot. I couldn't imagine why. I have been walking and running for ten years and this hasn't happened in any other brand. I thought maybe it was the extreme heat, so tonight it is much cooler and I went for a walk. The shorts were still hot and they cut into me at the waist, the dropped waist seam and at the hem. When I took them off, the seams at the gusseted crotch had pulled out. I don't mind if a brand puts me in an XL, but the reviews say these are true to size. Another review says she is 5'6"" and 180 and the large fits her well. I can't begin to imagine how that can be unless she carries her weight in her wrists or both pair I received were mismarked."
4439,3,"This product comes complete with a letter asking for a 5star review. Once this has been confirmed by the seller, you get a free undefined gift. Which means most of the glowing reviews here are coerced.As for the product, it's a thick foam rollup pad. I bought it for a child wanting to try yoga with a friend, and it was cheap, so it was fine for that I guess. While I'm not a Yoga expert, and can only reach my toes with a bended knee, this is a Pilates mat - NOT a Yoga mat. This is very thick and oversized compared to any other Yoga mats.I despise manipulated reviews, and I got caught. So one star for you so folks might notice, and since I'm still in my return window it's going back."
4440,3,"Unfortunately this mat is really impractical for yoga. While I thought it was great at first, the more I used it the more trouble I had with sinking into the mat while am trying to hold long and challenging poses. If you're doing sit ups, it's probably great as it's very very cushiony and feels great. Unfortunately, if you're doing advanced yoga postures that involve concentrated holds and balance, you start to sink into the foam, which can throw you off balance and in my case led to pain in my wrists. It's a shame as I was really excited about how comfortable it was at first, but now find that I just can't balance properly in the most challenging postures."
4441,3,"2.5 stars. The OPM has great potential. It really does. But it's not quite capitalizing upon it, This was my first yoga mat that I purchased. $10, what a steal, right? I have laminate floors and I could not do any routines without slipping and stretching the mat all over the place. I didn't realize how much harder and undesirable a routine could be when you had the extra distraction of a stretchy, slippery mat. I also thought that thicker would be more comfortable, but I am actually going to try a standard 1/4 inch mat instead of this one because it almost seems too thick. The only redeeming quality was that I did not experience any tears like other customers, but with the amount of stretching, I could definitely see it happening. I used this maybe 4 or 5 times but I want to move on to something else at this point."
4442,3,"I should have listened to the other reviewers! I bought this mat because I wanted to have less pain while doing exercises like modified pushups or yoga poses that involve contact with my back/knees. The mat is certainly thick and helped to reduce the amount of pain I felt in my knees and back bones. HOWEVER, after only a few uses the mat started to tear on its surface. Moreover, this mat slips really badly! I have laminate wood floors; however, I also have two other yoga mats in the house and they do NOT slip."
4443,3,"I was blown away by the high rating this mat received and the non-tear guarantee. So I bought it. After only a 10 pilates classes, it began to tear between the ridges. I'm very disappointed. I returned it for a full refund. Granted, the cushioning is awesome and the material didn't have a toxic odor. But, what good is it if it tears even with the guarantee. Obviously, since I'm not the first and only one to have this experience, there's a design flaw. In pilates, there isn't as much stressing and stretching of the mat like in yoga. So I imagine it will just tear faster if using this for yoga practice.Side Note: This is a dangerous mat for yoga practice. It's very stretchy and slips easily making it unreliable for poses that require stability like warrior, vinyasa, and down dog. It's best suited for more static purposes like pilates, crunches or cool down stretching, where more cushion is needed under knees and spine."
4444,3,"This top is very slinky and soft, which makes it very comfortable. Unfortunately when I jump up and down in my aerobics classes it creeps up and bunches at my waist. I don't want to show my stomach while I am working out, so I have to keep pulling it down during the high intensity jumping routines. But when we aren't jumping up and down, it stays put and is fine. So it will do great when I weight lift. I'll keep it because it still looks cute :)."
4445,3,"Ok first of all the pink one is definitely NOT pink, it’s absolutely more of an orange, unless I’m colorblind ... or they sent me the wrong one. Whatever so it’s not my best color that’s for sure, but I decided to wear it tonight anyway.DEFINITELY size up if you’ve got any concerns or between sizes, glad I did.I’m a short person and it’s not long at all as the pic may lead you to think.However, it still gets some stars because it’s perfectly functional, worked great for my weight lifting workout. Because it’s fitted you can really see your form. I like that. Nice light material.Quality seems ok although personally I don’t believe it’s worth $15.... I would maybe buy more if they were $10."
4446,3,"This shirt is a nice workout shirt but I expected the color to match the photo. The photo shows the color as a neon green, when the shirt arrived it was not neon but rather an avocado green. I was hoping for a neon color. The two ears in the back that allow it to be tied should be longer. When I tied them I could barely tie them because they were so short. Either make them longer or lift the slit to be higher. Overall it is Okay but needs a little more manufacturing improvement on color and style."
4447,3,"The top is pretty, but the material is weird and clingy - not fitted like normal workout clothing. It's also not breathable at all, so within about 5-10 minutes I had sweat through about a third of the top and the wet spots made it even more clingy. It's probably fine for athleisure use or for very light workouts, but definitely not for cardio/weight training/HIIT."
4448,3,"I ordered this last week in the wine color and loved it so much I decided I would add more colors and start with black. Well, waited my few days so excited to wear my new black tank to a workout and it came as the wrong size. It’s a size large in a medium bag. After reading some further reviews, seems like this happens often, size of top doesn’t match size ordered/on package. I guess what bothers me the most is now I have to go through hoops to return it, wait on a refund and if I want it, risk ordering again with the chance of it happening again. :("
4449,3,"I got a S size which is my normal size for most brands but the pieces turned out 1) way too big, feels almost like a M-L, and 2) the fit for the blue one turned out slightly smaller than the black and grey which surprised me since they are supposed to be the same size. Read so many reviews where customers sized up but i highly recommend that if anything we should size down. I'm usually happy to wear a slightly baggy fit but here the pieces look ridiculous on me because the armhole is so huge that it exposes too much of the sports bra underneath and sticks out at the underarm area."
4450,2,"I bought a couple sizes up (bought XL, I'm usually a medium), per reviews. It was still tight on my stomach but loose in my chest. Not flattering at all. For reference, I'm 5' 6"", 148 pounds, B cup and am pear shaped (not a large stomach). I came on here to return and i'm a few days past the return policy. So disappointed! I'm never going to wear them and I spent way too much!"
4451,3,"Much larger than expected. I'm 5'8, 135 lbs, and I normally wear a small in shirts. Based off of the other reviews and the size chart, I ordered a set of three in medium. The shirts I received were all much too big, and fit like a size large. I am taking advantage of the free shipping and sending them back. I will not be purchasing replacements in a smaller size, because I worry that even the small would not fit. A more accurate size chart would be extremely useful here.Otherwise, the quality of the fabric is nice and the colors are exactly as depicted. However, they do tend to flare under the armpit, which is quite unflattering. Maybe a smaller size would fix that issue, but I think it's just due to the way they are sown. If you do buy these, I'd suggest ordering your normal size (or smaller if you want a tighter fit) and ordering a single shirt before going for the set of three."
4452,3,"I'm 5' nothing, 114 lbs, 34A, usually wear size small. The pictures make these tanks look loose fitting, but it's not. It's fitted. I was hoping for something a little more loose fitted. Based on the reviews, I ordered a size up and found the products still too tight for my liking.Note for the person reading this - I don't like clothes that cling or fit tight. If you prefer your clothes fitted or tight, I'd suggest ordering your correct size in this."
4453,3,"I found these to run VERY small. I read a lot of reviews and was okay with a “fitted” tank so I bought my normal size. They are SKIN TIGHT and show every figure flaw. The fabric didn’t feel nice to the touch— it was super synthetic feeling with very little stretch and not soft to the touch. They felt like a knock off athletic material as opposed to how a name brand athletic, moisture wicking material would feel. I was disappointed with the fit and the fabric so I will be returning— not for me! I couldn’t even bear to post a photo of me wearing the tanks becuase they were SO unflattering. (I am a size medium 6/8 for reference)."
4454,3,I ordered an extra small and I’m typically an extra small or small and this came wayyy too big it was baggy all over and wouldn’t even stay up it it was huge everywhere but the very bottom and it was too short it ended before me ankle. I can’t imag it would fit anyone especially not someone who would be ordering an extra small. The material was super itchy and see though as wellUpdate: I have spent about a week trying to contact them and just the same message a day or two later saying that over seas shipping is expensive so I don’t want to return it and they will refund me 10%. It’s ridiculous I bought an extra small and according to those measurements that they have for their product it should fit me perfectly and it’s way too big but every single time I explain that to them I get that exact same message. They must send completely different products to some people because I don’t understand how anybody is happy with this.
4455,1,"I loved the feel of the leggings of the first pair I'd bought. I bought another smaller pair of pants to see if it'd fix my issue with how loose the fit was. They sent me really cheap feeling pants that do NOT stretch with squatting, and on the package, say it's worth 1.33USD. I'm extremely upset and never have hated a product from amazon this much to need to return and never get ever again. It's cheap, doesn't stretch, and is the shittiest quality pants I've ever put on. It just feels like cheap polyester on my legs and slides down. It's definitely not even the same make as the first pair. Dont risk getting a shitty pair of pants and save ur money for another brand."
4456,2,"These are great value for the price, thick enough to ensure they’re not see through if bending over or working out, very supportive and thin enough that they are super comfortable to wear all day. UPDATE: we liked the first ones so much we ordered 2 more. Advertising says Prime 2 day delivery, they took over a month to arrive. The second order is much worse quality. The fabric is rough and they make noise with every step, and sag at the crotch. We asked to return them and they said we could get 10% of the price back! Definitely never ordering from this vendor again."
4457,3,"I had high hopes for these pants because they come with good reviews. They are not for me and I will be returning them. I sized up after reading previous reviews that the fit is small. I'm 5'5, approx. 160 lbs, and usually wear a Large, but went with the XL figuring they are tights and the one size difference wouldn't matter too much. I was either wrong about L vs. XL or the whole thing fits me improperly. They bunched and gapped at my ankles and the waist rolled as soon as I put them on. Sadly they just aren't for me."
4458,3,"I ordered the light Heather gray and the black. They both fit differently.The black are thicker and tighter, but I don't have any issues of my panties being visable even while at the gym doing squats.The Heather gray on the other hand, is lighter, softer and overall more comfortable. However, even when standing you can see exactly what color and pattern my panties are, let alone if I bend over.Very upset with drastic difference in fit and quality."
4459,3,"I was told by a company rep that this bra fit the profile of their now discontinued FT434 bras, which were 93% nylon 7% spandex; I use these as daywear and under my recreational dance dresses, so they don't have to be corsets. It's as if the material engineers ignore the big difference in stretchability between cotton and nylon. Duh! There is no way this stretches over my breasts vertically. Hopeless. Even had to go up 3 sizes or so in Bestina to get the stretch needed without the rib cage hem trying to cut off my circulation. A fortune awaits the first bra company to bring back FT434 bras without stupid dyes that run for daywear and recreational underwear use."
4460,3,"After a few wears and washes I have decided I no longer enjoy this product. It feels as though the fabric needs to be lowered as it rides up in front (I even bought them again in a size up thinking maybe they just ran small). I am going through my drawers and getting rid of these as they are not enjoyable. I bought these for an upcoming gallbladder surgery where some of the scars will be on/near the bra line. I have worn one the past few days to see how they would hold up and they are loose enough where I don't feel like my ribs are being squeeze, yet tight enough where I'm getting support.Material is lighter then expected and I'm sure these will be great in the summer. Not an actual sports bra I'd wear for working out, but good enough when you don't want to worry about overly supportive unwire bras."
4461,2,"Be very careful washing these on warm, or cold, or even looking at them the wrong way - they are VERY shrink-prone. I don't think I've ever had an article of clothing shrink as much as this product.I'm just using them to sleep in, as I'm a new mom and I wanted something simpler than a nursing bra. When they arrived they were a bit too big, but I didn't think it would matter much just to sleep in. After a wash cycle or two I can't stand wearing them because they're hard to get on and ride up immediately. I can't imagine actually trying to exercise in them."
4462,2,"These are, as expected, not ""a lot"" of support for my 38I breasts, but for lounging around the house they'll do. I ordered the 40 and they are comfortable. Most of the stuff I do is not ""bounce-intensive"" so these will be a good alternative for those low-key days.Edit: after a few washings these have shrunk unbearably. I will have to find some teenaged cousin to pass them along to. (More likely they will get used as rags to wash the car, or something.) Dropping to one star."
4463,1,"Save your money. The product description ""Women's Built-Up Sportsbra"" would be accurate if they removed the words ""Built-up"" and ""Sports"". The front is two layers of stretchy cotton with elastic and the back is one layer. There is no additional support at all. Tank tops with built in shelf bras offer more support. These could not be used for any activity more strenuous or motion-oriented than sitting still. They are getting returned immediately. This product turned up in a search for ""High impact sports bra"" which could not be further from the truth."
4464,3,"2.5 stars. The OPM has great potential. It really does. But it's not quite capitalizing upon it, I am disappointed in these leggings. The quality isn’t the same as the 2 other pairs of leggings that I have already own. When I saw them on line and was less expensive than what I paid for in the store, I thought it was a no brainer to get a few more leggings. Wrong….I bought 3 pairs. Two of them are the capris and the other is full length.These are the issues I have with the leggings:1. The fabric is subpar. On each pair of capris, the texture was different from each other. One pair had a smooth finish and the other was not. I don’t think there should be such a difference since they are the same style.2. The fabric is see thru. When you look at it, without stretching, no problem. However, when you bend forward, you can see what god gave you. I even tried wearing nude panties. You can still see everything. So, there is no way I will wear them when I go to Pilates. I can only wear them under my long tops that cover my bottom.3. The elastic at the waistband is inconsistent. Each pair has different issues. One pair, the first time putting them on, I heard a bunch of threads breaking. Now when I wear them, the waistband is not secure. I keep pulling them up. Then the 2nd pair, threads were breaking too, but the waistband is still secure. The 3rd pair, the waistband keeps rolling down on me.4. The rise of the leggings is inconsistent. These leggings are suppose to be at the waist. 2 of mine are at the waist; however, one of them is just below my bellybutton.5. The crotch of 2 of them keep falling down. On of them the waistband is at my waist and the other is not.6. The color of the “new olive” isn’t green. It’s a grey that has green overtones not blue-black, not what was pictured on line. The color reminds of my clay dirt in my yard. Not a pretty grey.I would say don’t bother wasting your money buying these leggings. I can’t believe how different they are in comparison to the same style leggings that I purchases in the store. It makes me wonder if they are bloopers, not the good quality ones being sold."
4465,1,"These pants were COMPLETELY SEE-THROUGH when you caused the fabric to stretch in any way (e.g., bending over, kneeling, squatting, etc/). My Dad was, unfortunately, the one who alerted me to this issue . . . SO THAT WAS FUN (READ: MORTIFYING).First, let me say that I own at least 8 pairs of 90 Degree by Reflex Power Flex capris/leggings and have absolutely loved them all - to this point, they've been super, super comfortable, have fit like a glove and haven't stretched out, have just enough compression to them that your stomach looks flat and your butt looks awesome without making you feel like your bottom half is being strangled, and are made of a thick enough material that they aren't sheer but not so thick that they make you hot; I usually love them. However, after trying my normal size in this style (S - 140, 5'7"") and noticing that they fit a lot smaller than usual, I went up one size. I tried the medium pair on and thought they looked as good as they felt . . . having never had an issue with the pants being sheer, and because they looked completely solid when I stood in front of the mirror, I thought I was good to go. NOPE. I don't know if the style, manufacturer, fabric composition, or what has changed, but these bad boys are NOT the same quality as they have been in the past. DEFINITELY CHECK YOUR ORDER BY BENDING OVER IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR OR CHECKING OUT HOW THEY STRETCH OVER YOUR KNEES WHEN YOU SQUAT BEFORE LEAVING THE HOUSE IN THESE PANTS."
4466,3," I first bought these leggings in the summer of 2017. My favorite Mossimo leggings from Target were discontinued, and I was looking for a replacement. I purchased both a Large and a Medium and was pleasantly surprised with how sturdy the fabric felt and how well the Medium fit. I bent over to do a squat and was even more excited when my bright pink underwear wasn’t even showing through! I recently decided to add to my collection with a size medium 2 pack (black and heather charcoal). Imagine my dismay when I pulled the black pair out of the bag and the material felt very thin compared to my original pair!! I held them up to the light and could see completely through them! I pulled them on over the same pair of bright pink underwear, and without even squatting, my underwear was clearly visible. The grey pair seems to be made of the same fabric as my original black pair, but what’s the point in paying for 2 leggings to only get one usable pair! The original fabric was AMAZING, they might be the best leggings I have ever worn (and I basically LIVE in leggings). But the fabric seems to have been modified recently (perhaps to cut down on manufacturing costs?) and the new material is HORRIBLE! I’m a very disappointed customer. I’ve included a video with a flashlight demonstration to show how see-through they’ve become!"
4467,3,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to give a review for a product I purchased on Amazon. Several months ago I purchased a pair of these 90 Degree by Reflex - High Waist Tummy Control Capris in Dark Navy, and I absolutely loved them. The fit was true, they were very good quality and I loved the fabric, which was very wicking but not see thru. I decided to order another pair, this time in Charcoal Grey. The order was fulfilled by another vendor, CJ Technology, and this color showed that it would ship in 3-4 weeks, which I was ok with. When the pants arrived, they were NOTHING like the first pair that I had. The first pair was a size Medium, and this second pair was also a Medium, but it had to be a Child's medium. I've attached a photo of the two pairs, one on top of the other. I thought maybe they were meant to stretch out when you tried them on, but I couldn't even get an ankle through the leg hole, they were as tight as compression stockings and no way I could get them on. The fabric is completely different than the first pair, it's more of a lycra, shimmery dance pants fabric with less wicking. I requested a return, and was offered to keep the gray pair, with a 50% refund, if I didn't ship them back. Nice offer, but I have no use for a pair of yoga pants that would fit a child. They're going back."
4468,3,"Returning! In the reviews I read, most people said that these run small and to order a size up. Well...I’m pretty well endowed and need a lot of support for my workouts and so I actually ordered a size down. And...it was not even remotely supportive! When I first put it on, I thought it might be...even though I could see pretty major jiggle from just a slight bounce. Then, the longer I had it in, the more I could feel my breasts pulling the bra down in front and pulling it up in the back. I want a sports bra that’s going to keep the girls where they’re supposed to be without having to pull and tug on it every 2 seconds. I’m not sure I would even wear these for just lounging around the house!"
4469,3,"I followed the guide and should have been a medium I'm a 36 but don't know what cup I am because I've lost 14 pounds due to weight loss. I tried one on right away as soon as they showed up. Way to tight, squished the ladies and very painful around the ribcage and back. So then I had my oldest daughter try one on, she's a 34B....to tight for her too.so then I had my youngest 12 year old try one on, she's very tall and slender and barely out of training bra's.....it fit her and the only good part of all of this is she likes them because it makes her look like she has boobs and the color. Disappointed and would have been nice to treat myself to new sports bras from weight loss."
4470,3,"This is the worst sports bra ever! The padding isn’t connected to anything and moves freely inside the fabric. It looks like 1980’s shoulder pads stuffed in between 2 pieces of cheese cloth. I thought I’d give it a try since I bought them, but after 10 minutes of jogging I can tell the girls aren’t getting the support they need and the awesome free-floating padding has migrated to where they truly belong...my shoulders. So now I look ready for the power position of my dreams and I’m moving on to a name brand athletic bra for the girls!"
4471,2,"I ordered the 3XL based on my size 1) I bulged out of the sides 2) sagged like a sleeping bra. Additionally, I could immediately smell that same horrible ""gassing off"" smell from petroleum products - like a cheap shoe store/shoe section at Walmart or many of the bathroom shower curtains or non-slip tub mats. I tried on one carefully, but it had a noticeable black smudge on it and the pads in the cup liners shifted around easily. There is also NO WAY to adjust the traps. Otherwise, the bright colors were pretty and it was somewhat soft. I was hoping these would give relieve to my aching shoulders and my shoulder bra dents, but sending them back. Yuck."
4472,2,"These fit fine, but the pink bra was NOT colorfast. I'm extremely lucky in that, of the whole load of laundry I ran with these bras in it, only a pillowcase, a towel, and the white bra were ruined by the pink one. Even going back and putting the bra in a sink to soak out the rest of the dye, there's still a TON in there. This could have literally ruined half of my entire wardrobe. The others seem fine. I don't know why the pink is so insanely full of dye still.I have now spent DAYS trying to get all the excess dye out of the pink bra. It's impossible. I've soaked it in hot water, in cold. I've soaked it in a washer full of water, by itself. I've used vinegar and salt. I've done everything I can think of to get this bra colorfast, and it just doesn't work. I'm going to have to throw it away and call it a loss."
4473,3,"Pretty thick and spongy feeling, but not very durable, if I was you, I would spend a little more and go with a quality name brand, I just use mine for regular workouts and stretching, did things like push-ups and planks etc., mine tore a small hole in it within less than two months using it about four days a week for 10 to 20 minutes. I didn't use anything superheavy her sharp that should have torn a hole, I think it just tore because the mat was stretching beneath my weight in a plank or push-up type position, I weigh about 215 so not superheavy."
4474,1,"Worst purchase ever. I bought this on May 1st 2018 and have had it sitting out trying to air out. Today is June 10 and it still smells like cat pee, And I don't own a cat!! The stench just permeates the room. I would be far too embarrassed to take this to a yoga class. I have sprayed it down TWICE with super grade odor neutralizer and still ZERO luck. Save your money and absolutely look for something else. Stay with 1/2 inch though, as that's a great thickness. But don't buy here, unless you want this horrible stench to linger in your home or embarrass you in class too."
4475,1,"The carry strap that was supposed to come with the mat was NOT included. I plan to use this at home, so I don't need the strap to actually carry it anywhere, but it would be nice to be able to strap it up to store it when its not in use. It does have that new mat odd chemical smell, but I expect that will go away in time. The mat is comfortable, and perfect for sciatic stretching. I'm just upset that I didn't get the strap as promised. If I'd know the ad was incorrect and there was no strap, I never would have ordered it. If you're looking for a mat you can carry, do not order this one!"
4476,3,"This mat has a chemical smell that attaches to you like in the Seinfeld episode The Smelly Car. I have tried everything to get rid of it including ivory dish soap, vinegar, baking soda, febreze, over ten days of sun and fresh air, and eventually an industrial washing machine. The smell has defeated all of these methods which is quite impressive. I did use it twice, and it was nice. However, I cannot take the smell."
4477,3,"Hideous, toxic stench to the thing that will not go away. The stink will even get on one's clothes and skin after using the mat. I've had the stupid mat for 2-3 months, and time has obviously not dissipated the smell of the thing Ivve repeatedly wiped it down with peroxide, and wiped it down with antibacterial wipes, and have left it with fans blowing on it; to no avail. This abomination would not make one popular in an enclosed yoga class.The mat seems of okay material, but the use of it is barely ever tolerable due to that malefic, hellish, clinging stink. Where was this thing made, a toxic waste dump in Pakistan?"
4478,3,"These are just ok, and there are many comparably priced gym pants out there that are much better. The fabric is nice, but the waistline and ankles are problematic. The ankles are really loose and the waistline has a thin piece of elastic at the very top, rather than the single thick, fitted high waist of higher quality pairs. These also kind of flatten the butt, so ladies with a smaller waist and a bigger butt, you’ve been warned haha. I’m 5’4 and 117 and the small fits ok, so I’d say they run true to size. I’m going to keep them for yard work and crafts with the kids (anything where I need junky pants) but I probably won’t be wearing them to the gym or the store. The pocket is nice though."
4479,3,"I wanted to love these yoga pants do to the fact that I love the high waist fit, and cell phone pocket feature. However, they are not great for actually working out. Theyslide down while lightly jogging or while running. Maybe I needed to order a smaller size, I am 5'7'', size 8 , and ordered a medium. I find the fit is TTS. These are also a more heavy weight material which I was anticipating them to be lightweight. . Order these if you plan to just use these for casual wear or light walking."
4480,3,"I was disappointed that after purchasing a size L during pregnancy- and loving them- I went to purchase the same pants in size M and received a completely different material and style. I originally loved the slip of the material because it didn't stick to dog hair or fuzzies from the dryer. However, the material of the size M does. I'm not sure why I received a different style from size to size, but it was a shame."
4481,3,"I'm a fitness instructor so I wear this & the like every day of my life. These pants do not have any tummy control at all. They are leggings so they stretch but absolutely no tummy control as advertised. Also, I used the size chart and it was way off. I'm a medium in most of my fitness clothing. The chart said I am an XL. WAY too big. The crotch was sagging in seconds of starting my workout. Also, I paid $18.65 but they are only refunding me $17.72 for their deceptive description. WTH??!! Other than that, I like the fabric & I like the pocket."
4482,3,"I’m a height of 5’4 so buying pants and dresses online has always been a hassle. I usually wear a size 10 but I bought a size bigger just to be sure. When I put them on they were kind of tight but afterwards they have a nice give to them to where it’s not extremely tight. The material is super soft and not at all like those work out clothes spandex. My only problem is, given my height, there was an extra 3 or so inches of fabric left over!! Around the house, no biggie, but if I were to leave I’d look messy!"
4483,3,"The material on these pants is fine, relatively thin, but not awful. It is not compression-fit material in any way, however. The problem is that there is a thick, stiff, wide (~1-1.5inches) piece of elastic in the waistband of these pants. This results in the high waistband squeezing tightly around your abdomen and the thin, stretchy, non-compressive material below it creating a reverse muffin-top. Super ugly and incredibly uncomfortable. Why would you need an elastic band that stiff around the waistband?? Perhaps if you had an incredibly small waist compared to your hips. I am a classic apple shape with a small bum and an average sized waist. I usually wear a size small in yoga pants, but I went with the size chart on these and ordered a medium. The fit was ok, but that might have explained why I found them in no way compression-fit. Still, if I had gotten a small, the elastic at the waist might have crushed my abdominal organs."
4484,3,"UGH. So frustrated by these. First, I bought the purple, ankle-length striped leggings. I loved them. Now, they are no Lululemons (they are that slightly shinier type of spandex rather than the soft/cotton-feeling kind), but for 20 bucks, they fit well, weren't see-through, and looked cute. Great alternative to something like Fabletics.In fact, I liked them so much, I bought the navy, ankle-length with the folds. Worth three stars, but I'm knocking to one because the product is so different from the purple pair. They should really be a separate listing with their own set of reviews, not just a different color. Issues:- The stripe pair had a thick elastic band at the waist, the fold pair does not, and while exercising I am constantly pulling them up- The knee and calf are TIGHT! Like almost hard to pull over my legs. I'm thin but do have strong calves, though I've never had a problem with boots, pants, or leggings being snug. These are uncomfortable, leave marks, and make it hard to pull up as described above.- See through. At first I didn't realize it, but looking in the mirror at pilates... yes, there's my underwear.Very frustrated by the folded pair but I do endorse the striped pair. One star to the company for having such wildly different products under the listing."
4485,2,"I am 6' tall about 170lbs. I have very long legs, 37"" inseam that are not heavy at all. Athletic build. I gave up a long time ago trying to find legging that will fit the length of my legs. Even if they are advertised as ankle leggings I just expect them to be capris on me. These fit like capris as I expected which is not the problem. I ordered a size XL which should have fit me comfortably. I understand that these are more like compression leggings, however, I could barely get these over my thighs and butt. They dug into my calfs and stomach terribly. I couldn't imagine working out in these without being out of breath from how tight they are. According to the measurments they should have fit me. Very disappointed. I would recommend these legging based on the quality of the material and how high the waist is. My advise would be to order a size up."
4486,3,"I really wanted to like these, but the construction at the waist really has me scratching my head. There is a waistband, about an inch thick, right at the top, that is tighter than the rest of the waist/tummy section. So, compression is not really happening in an evenly distributed way. I wore them once to a yoga class, and it was the worst I've ever felt about my figure. I'll be sticking to the leggings I already have (that don't have the weird super-tight elastic band at the top) while I look for something that fits better."
4487,3,"I want to love this product. Months ago, I bought the ankle-black and ankle-white and they were absolutely perfect. Couldn't see my underwear. They were thick. They had a perfect compression. They were FIVE STARS. No, TEN STARS.So why the two stars now? Well, when the side of my ankle-black was ripped by walking by something sharp, I decided I needed a new one. And why not stop there? I selected a new ankle-black, ankle-darkgrey, ankle space dye white, and fold-blue. They arrived today (11/8/2018). The only one worth keeping is the ankle-black.Ankle-darkgrey, ankle space dye white, and fold-blue, with all of them the fabric felt significantly thinner. In fact, I could pretty much see my skin through ankle space dye white, as well as every inch of my underwear. Ankle darkgrey I could have loved, but as I ordered an XL, as I pulled them on they were obviously a size L. It does say XL on the tag/fabric. And lastly, fold-blue did have a nice fit... except for the folds around the calves. They are unforgiving and dig in. When I flex my my calves (i.e. walking), I feel bands of uncomfortable pressure. The fit everywhere but the salves was perfect. Somehow the ankle-black one is usable. Even then, it still feels thinner than my other ankle-black.I'll be returning all but the ankle-black. Suspicious thing is, despite ordering them all at the same time, they came in different packages. With the ankle-black coming by itself. It makes me suspicious that the other three are some kind of knock offs, despite all of them coming in the fancy 'dragonfit' bags.This disappointed me greatly. I thought these were going to be THE pants. Two stars for the fact that I got one pair out of four that I can use. So, while I can't speak for the capri, I can speak for the ankle length ones. The only ones worth getting are ankle-black and ankle-white, in my opinion. Everything else is a really big gamble."
4488,2,"I ordered these after a year of just wearing regular leggings or running shorts to spin. They are very soft and have great give; they are not impossibly tight on my stomach like so many other higher waisted work out pants I try on. The downside to these shorts are that they are thin and thus, fairly see through when bending or moving about. Additionally, they roll up a bit while I'm riding my bike and I'm constantly pulling them down. I don't mind as much of how thin or see through they are as my bike is in our home, I just wouldn't wear them out in public. I'm more bothered that they roll up, that drives me a little crazy, especially during an interval ride where I'm up and down out of the seat. They don't roll as much at all when I'm just working out afterward and not on my bike. Therefore, I would recommend them if you are just looking for something to wear around the house, to do a light workout in or if you're wearing them underneath of something else."
4489,3,"I liked the way they fit and looked on me but going out into public in those isn’t something I’d do because they’re see through. I bought these shorts for the purpose of wearing them out in public but can’t because I don’t want to expose myself. I’ve tried doubling up by wearing one over another one and it’s almost a lil too tight and uncomfortable having on. All in all, the product wasn’t everything I hoped for but definitely looks really cute to where at home or under a dress."
4490,3,"The seam on the inside is weird. It looks like it goes sideways, so these's a weird seam in the center that is a little uncomfortable. Pads and liners don't stick well because the middle part doesn't lay flat like most underwear. There's usually a layer of fabric in women's underwear that's shaped so the pad or liner will lay flat. I feel like these shorts must have been designed by a male, because a woman would have definitely seen this problem and designed them differently! I Iove the material and they are very comfortable otherwise. I just wish the inside seam was different."
4491,1,I really wanted to love these shorts. I didn't want them for working out. Just for wearing under my summer dresses. Unfortunately the first pair I pulled out had a hole near the front of the leg. So I decided to take out the other two pairs and check them out. Didn't see any holes. But I'm sure after a couple of wears they would fall apart. They are as thin as a panty hose. They weren't tight. But the band was very thin and didn't add any support. They would be ok if you were laying around the house. But the fact that the first pair had a hole in it. I cannot recommend these shorts at all. I wouldn't want to spend more then 2$ each. Im returning.
4492,3,"I liked the fabric, it's soft, but there are two vertical seams on the inner thigh area and one on the outer and might be kind of bothersome. Sizing is a little small. I am 5'2"", 135, and Large fits me well, when I usually take a medium. UPDATE: I have been wearing these and as bike shorts or under dresses, they would be great. I bought them for underwear and they are a little long, but the seams turned out to be not bad at all. I understand the 2-vertical seams (leaving a space on the inner thigh) concept now; the seams, as are, would be best for biking!"
4493,3,Agree with users in hot climates it is not for us. The towel has a lining fabric(the black on the grey part) and it feels like flannel. Draping the cooling towel around the neck just seals in the heat and if one does not move it frequently the section that touches your skin gets warm and stays warm you therefore have a warm towel on your neck. That is Not a good result with 99 heat index.I lke the size and the weight and so wish it worked. I wonder if removing the flannel like lining would provide more cooling. Has anyone tried that? .
4494,3,"They cannot keep cool over an hour. Don’t buy it if they’re shipped directly from China. The towels shipped from a province in China are smaller in size. They don’t have printed logos so hell knows where they’re from. Fabric not the same. The towels are much less stretchy and don’t hold water well. Even though I tried to squeeze all water out, water still dropped and my shirt got wet in fifteen minutes.I bought six items in two separate orders that’s why I noticed the difference.Customer support is ineffective. Seven back and forth emails and they couldn’t provide a good solution."
4495,3,"I bought 2 of these for my 4 year old twins. Initially my twins both had a hard time closing the top, but they eventually got the hang of it. You have to apply quite a bit of pressure. We are approaching the 3 month mark since purchasing and the top on one of them is already cracked along the latch button and lock and is even harder to get to close (without the top closed, water pours out of the straw pretty quickly if tipped over). Considering these are supposed to be for children they reallly should be more durable and easier for little hands to open and close."
4496,3,"I'm currently eight months pregnant and bought this towel so that I can get through the summers here in Southern California. I've used this towel about a dozen times now and it feels no different than a slightly damp rag, with no special cooling properties. I've used it at night, draped over my legs or shoulders; I've used it during my daily walks; I've used it to cool down after workouts; it does pretty much nothing. It feels cool for about two minutes and then my body heat warms it and then it's just a damp rag. I've tried re-wetting and snapping it and still nothing. A wet washcloth placed in the fridge or freezer would work much better and be cheaper."
4497,3,"This is just like any scarf. You could get the same effect from any strip of cloth. And yes I do mean a strip of cloth. If you put it around your neck, there is only a very small area that touches your skin and a whole lot hanging down. If you don't mind looking goofy, you could wind it around your neck a few times, I guess. Yes, it is cooler after you snap it but the coolness only lasts about 30 seconds. I took it on a half-hour hike on a super hot day. I had to snap it at least 10 times, and it was almost completely dry by the end. It also is starting to smell of mildew."
4498,3,"I wish I would have read the reviews more carefully. I was so excited to find this style bra as racerbacks cut on my traps and cause headaches after a while. They arrived today, and when I tried them on, I immediately felt little sharp threads around the top of the bra. I took it off to feel, and I couldn’t feel them. Put it back on, and it felt like tiny razors pressing in my skin. I’ve owned countless sports bras, and I’ve never experienced this. It’s so weird. So back they go, and my search continues."
4499,3,"I have a very large bust and was pretty excited because i found sports bras that had actually bra sizes, not just S, M, L, XL.I'm a 38 DD and i ordered just that size, i received it about 5 days after I purchased it (it took longer than my regular 2 day shipping). As soon as i received it I tried it on and to my disappointment it did not fit... There was probably a 7 finger gap on my back when i tried closing it. I was very disappointed because i expected more from a $30 bra.any suggestions as to a sports bra that is true to size and comfortable for people with a larger bust?"
4500,3,"I gave this bra a try for mulitple wears and finally ended up throwing it away. It was not the fit...which was good and in keeping with Champion's fit. It was sharp tiny ""thread"" on the seam just above the breast others have mentioned. It not noticeable until you actually attempt to work out in it and then the friction literally feels like a piece of steel wool in your bra. I could barely run with it on and when I took it off I would have a red irritated mark on my chest. I tried to shave the spot, washed it in hot, trimmed with a scissors...nothing. The weirdest issue I have ever had with a item of clothing. Worse is you can't see anything on closer inspection. Its as if the thread itself is made of fiberglass. So ODD."
4501,3,"I've owned other Champion Sports Bras, so I was excited to see these, in many colors, with adjustable straps. First, this claims to be Full-Support. Literally, I would do nothing above a walk or spin - maybe, on a cycle in this - if I were to keep it, but I'm sending it back. The straps, when fully adjusted to it's smallest, are still too large and slide down off of my shoulder. The support is non-existent. You could never go for a run in this sports bra if you have a chest larger than a B ..... I'm totally disappointed."
4502,2,"The Champion Spot Comfort Sports Bra is my everyday bra. What I love about it is that I can get the support I need and it is comfortable. This used to be a good bra, but the new bras I just ordered are just horrible. There are a lot of problems with how these bras are being made, from the straps to the stitching, to the inconsistent sizing, to the metal clasps on the band. The straps are way too short. I compared the new bras I just ordered to the bras I own and the straps are definitely much shorter. Because the straps are much shorter, even when fully extended, the bra sits much higher, uncomfortably too far up into my armpit. When I hooked the metal clasps on the band, I noticed the clasps are pulling right out of the fabric! It looks as though each individual metal clasp is not anchored properly and securely. I am VERY disappointed in the quality of how these Champions bras are being made. Sizing is inconsistent too. I have ordered these bras online from Amazon, from Champion directly, and bought from a factory outlet location. It does not matter where you purchase these bras from because I have experienced the same problems. I have also experienced the stitching on the seams being extremely scratchy, abrasive on the skin, as others have commented about (although not on these recently ordered ones). Ordering these bras is definitely a gamble because you never know what you will get. If you do decide to purchase, make sure you order with a free return shipping option because it is likely you will have to return. I will be returning these bras. I feel strongly about products being made properly. Champion should take a close look into how the bras are being made in order to fix all the issues!"
4503,1,"Buyer beware! If these do not work out for you, you will have to pay the return shipping. It cost me almost as much to ship them back as it did to make the purchase in the first place. The seller's English is not always understandable when you are writing messages back and forth. The flesh color is closer to peach, and the straps did not lie flat for me, particularly in the shoulder area just behind the armpit. I would have had to cut out the arm holes and reline them in order to get the fit I needed. One good feature was the material that protects you from the zipper rubbing against your skin. I had to buy the XL ( I normally get a L )so there was no possibility of getting a better size."
4504,3,"Right after my breast augmentation, it felt comfortable to wear. But only after a few days it became less and less comfortable because as the swelling came down, the bra’s stretchy material offered no support or compression for my breasts and the straps were looser so my shoulders and neck didn’t have support. At night when I would sleep with it on, I would be in sooo much pain in the morning because my breasts would move around slightly during the night. I decided to look for another alternative. I ended up buying 5 other ones and the one I ultimately kept and am currently wearing day and night is the Kimikal post-surgery bra. I’ll be leaving a review on there so you can see why it’s amazing. Last note, these zip front bras are fine if you are just looking for something to lounge around in."
4505,1,"Not one nice thing to say about these.I actually started the return process right after i got them knowing they may not work but ran out of time before my surgery to find another front close.I am 2weeks post op on a implant exchange,lift and sculpting. I wore this bra home from surgery and tried all three thinking the next one would feel better but for four days and i was miserable. The placement of the hole for removing the pads is super stupid.Underarm soft tissue area. I was swollen and those holes left indention's on my skin that tuned very painful.(this was when i threw all three in the trash)The zipper on all three were not easy to zip up and material did not give even a comfortable amount of support.These bras did not come down far enough to NOT irritate my incisions. So all i can say now is do not buy them if you will have incisions or swelling."
4506,3,"The bras are nice but I was sent the wrong size. The black one has a tag that says 36B, when I ordered the size small (30A-32A). The gray one doesn't have a tag but it feels like it's about the same size as the black one, which is too big. Also, the two bras I ordered (came in a ""2-pack"") are vastly different from each other. They have opposite sided zippers from each other; the black one has a raw elastic band while the gray one's elastic is covered with fabric; and the black one is also more of regular style straps/back while the gray is racerback style (like the picture). I don't really care that much about these differences I just wanted the correct size. I will update my review if/when I hear from the seller and if they can/will help me out. Since I am having my surgery in a week and the items took a week to arrive (I pay for amazon prime and they did not arrive on time), I can't afford to send them back in case the replacement doesn't arrive on time because I have to have something to wear after my surgery, even if it doesn't fit."
4507,3,"I was told to buy front closure bras in advance of my mastectomy. These had decent reviews but when it finally came time to use them, I realized that they only have a zipper in the front and no hook to help hold the bra closed while you try to zipper it. I had a single mastectomy and had limited use of my left arm so trying to zipper close a bra (under tension) was almost impossible. The Jockey bras that I bought had the hook and were MUCH easier to use. Further, even though I up-sized and bough a Large (medium is more my size), these bras had very tight arm holes and I found that they would chaf/rub under my arm which created an abrasion. I wish I could return but I missed the return window."
4508,1,"As far as I'm concerned, the main job of a sports bra to make sure that nothing jiggles or bounces during sports. Normally, I will try to stand still, then walk up and down stairs, and then jump in place to see how supportive a new sports bra is. It's sad that a bustier woman like myself has to put all new sports bras through this test, but really I am just tired of being sore after a run.This bra offered no support, even when I was just standing still. Everything had its natural sag, so there wasn't even a hint of this bra ""trying"" to be supportive.. like one of those spandex camisoles with the built-in shelf bra.I would not recommend this bra for anybody who is a DD+ cup, and I'm really not sure if I would recommend it to anyone. Yes, it is cheap and it is cute, but it just did not work out for me."
4509,3,"The sizing is right on for me. The first problem is the amount of coverage-it's too much. The panel between the cups is so ridiculously high on my chest that when I wear my v neck shirts, it shows. I don't even know what purpose it's supposed to serve anyway. It doesn't help to control bounce whatsoever. It seems like a modesty panel at most. I'm all about modesty and no one needs any cleavage when working out; however, this panel serves no purpose and it shows! The second problem that I noticed is that the seams show underneath my shirts. Between the panel showing and the seams poking through, I would be so embarrassed if I had to be seen in public with this on under my clothes. Finally, this does not control or eliminate bounce. The fit was perfect, but all the other problems made this a no go and I'm returning for a refund. Very disappointed."
4510,3,"This bra has a fatal flaw. See that multi-colored trim that wraps the edges? I am convinced that little strip of material is a blend of steel wool, bee stings, and bad dating decisions. The bra is indeed “no-bounce” but only because movement of any kind is quickly discouraged by the sadistic trim that again, wraps the edges of the bra, guaranteeing multi-point skin contact. If a bra that raises welts is your thing, then look no further, this is the bra for you! If, on the other hand, you think the mark of an excellent bra is one that supports without constantly, and painfully, calling attention to itself, your quest continues.The one upside to this bra? It will re-introduce you to the full-body experience of gratitude when you take it off. Hope this helps."
4511,3,I'm highly disappointed. I researched I thought fairly well to find a plus size sports bra. An with all the reviews from other sources and amazon. I was sure this be a great purchase. I wear a 44I an that's after going through many different plus size clothing companies and finding quality bras that do all the wonderful things needed to keep your breast off the ground. So hear I am happy to find a sports bra that has my size an may hold the twins in place so I can workout without injury. Well nope I was wrong. I can't even get the hooks closed let alone within 2inches of one another to attempt hooking them. Also no give from elastic just nothing. From what I can tell the cup size is spot on. It just felt like I had a 40 or 42 instead of a 44.
4512,3,"So disappointing after reading such good reviews! I started running and needed a good sports bra to keep to keep the twins from bouncing so much. I thought this bra would be a good fit but it's not. There is NO underwire for any sort of support which to me is insanity especially for us busty gals. So you'll get as much support as wearing a t-shirt with no bra. It was NOT tight fitting, form fitting or even fitting the correct way that it should. It seemed a little loose but the band that goes right under your bust was way too big. The band should be tighter and smaller than your bust line NOT the same size. I tried tightening the straps and was only able to tighten it up to an inch before I ran out of space. Guess I'll just have to find a different bra.-Not a bad looking sports bra-No Support-No Underwire-No Padding-Fits somewhat larger than regular sizing-Straps doesn't tighten up enough-A total waste of time!"
4513,3,"I read reviews and saw ppl raving about these pants. Not sure which ones they ordered but this is why I am returning:1. The size tag is sewn into the “butt crack” seam and leaves a less than desired, non smooth look.2. The leg length is super long. I have never had an issue in pant length-ever. I would have to fold these several times or have stacked leggings and that is just ridiculous.3. They do not pass the bend over test. I can see right through them. No thanks.Apparently I’m not one of the lucky ones."
4514,1,No stars if it was up to me. I have no clue how anyone can say these are squat proof. I ordered two pies because of the amazing reviews and received the most horrendous leggings I could have bought material myself and made a better pair. The are NOT true to size. I’m 5’8” 190 pounds with an athletic build. The leggings hardly made it over my heels let alone my hips. The material is CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. I would not compare these to any high end legging. Buyer beware.
4515,3,I used to love these leggings. They were my absolute favorite leggings ever. Then they completely changed them. They’ve added these weird unnecessary seams all over the place so the leggings don’t stretch or move with your body at all. The worst thing about the new design is the seam that is supposed to hold up the pants. It’s goes straight across your butt rather than at your waist. Every two steps I take I have to pull them up. I don’t even wear these on a day when I’m squatting. These will be going in the trash as soon as I find a replacement brand I like. Super disappointing because at one point these were my favorite and the only pair of leggings I would wear.
4516,1,"This is not the product described. I have ordered these before (the black pair on the left) and they are amazing!! but when I ordered again (the gray pair) I received a horrible imitation. It clearly came from China from the packaging, was super thin, the waistband made a ripping sound as I put them on, and it had no brand markings or tags like the real pair. The black pair (real Tesla brand) were supportive and comfortable. The gray pair pinched my waste but was loose and unsupportive through the butt/crotch. Be careful! I guess this seller is sending out fake ones."
4517,3,"These are somewhat sheer material, which I do not like. They are thinner than other brands which makes them shoe flaws easily. I went to return them only to find out they were “not eligible for returns”. I am not happy and stuck with pants I’ll never wear. Size is accurate, but it’s really the only good thing. I’m 5’10”, 157 lbs, 29” waist, 38” hips, lean abs toned legs, and a smaller, muscular butt."
4518,1,"I've had this mat for about a month now and have kept it in my car, but the smell still hasn't gone away. I'm sure others in my yoga class can smell it, too! So annoying doing child's pose and you're breathing in this toxic smell. The mat is slippery when doing down ward dog or warrior poses. Also, it is so thick and squishy that it's hard to hold one legged poses...feels like you're standing on a sponge. The worse is that after 2-3 weeks of doing yoga, you can see indents as to where you've placed your hands & feet for certain poses. I have a pink colored mat and those ""spots"" now look like swirls of ""smooched bubble gum""---I'm not sure how else to describe it. The price is good, but it is seriously a piece of junk if you want to practice yoga on it. Would never recommend it."
4519,3,"In a quick scan of reviews I saw a comment or two about an odor, but others said theirs was fine so I took the leap. The mat arrived in great shape and fully enclosed in a tight clear wrap. I unrolled it and put some objects on the highly curled ends so I could use it later in the day. When I tried to lie on it the odor was overwhelming. I placed clothing under my head to not transfer that smell to my hair. Afterwards, I placed a fresh charcoal filter that's great for freshening closets right next to it. No improvement overnight. I then put it outside for a half day. When I brought it in, it had not improved and it was the first thing I smelled in the morning when I entered the large living space. So, this morning I put it back outside, until high winds forced it back inside. I recently dealt with a shower curtain that took a week to dissipate its pool toy smell and a table protector that spent time outside before Thanksgiving dinner. Neither of those products were as stubborn to release odor or as repungent. I find this odor more on the order of a dead animal smell than a manufacturing/chemical smell. If this eventually turns out to be the best mat on the planet, I'll write an update. For now I'll be busy trying to find the most out of the way place to stash it until it decides to ""lighten up."""
4520,3,"I wish I had not waited so long to use this. If I had used it even once in the window of time to send it back, I would have.First of all, it's too thick in a very supportive way. It is impossible to balance on it because it is spongy and gives under your feet.Any post that has a lunge or a standing split is impossible on this too, because it stretches. You start in one split and it puts you in a much deeper one as the mat gives way in both directions.I will probably give this to my dog as a dog bed, because that's very much all it's good for."
4521,1,"This is a very well cushioned mat, BUT I've used it for hot yoga and hiit training and it's terrible. I started using this for hot yoga two weeks ago, and there are already deep depressions where I put my hands and feet. It's only a matter of time before it rips in those spots. Then I tried using it for my hiit training, and the mat slipped around too much. I would not recommend this. I would rather have a harder, sturdier, and less cushioned mat than this one."
4522,1,"I just purchased this mat and used it last night for the first time during a 75 minute hot yoga class. I wish I would have taken the reviews more seriously and not wasted my money. It is such a thick, squishy mat that it is incredibly hard to balance; I have been practicing yoga for 4 1/2 years and normally don't have an issue with balance. While doing the 2nd tree pose during class, I finally decided it would be best to just do it on the cork floor instead of the mat. Don't waste your money if you're planning on using this to do yoga. I'm sure that it's good for other types of workouts, but not yoga and anything that requires balance."
4523,2,Had previously bought a similar pack of sports bras to these. Just wanted different colors. These ones are nothing like my others. The elastic band on the bottom is much slimmer and only washed 2 or 3 times and the padding got messed up (which happens in most sports bras). I pulled the pad the rest of the way out to straighten before putting it back in and apparently there's a silky fabric over the pad... Well both back and front silk came off so now i cannot even begin to get the pad back in. If i do there's no way to straighten it because it sticks too much. Will never buy these again!
4524,3,"My package arrived already opened. It had all the parts, so I figured whatever. After 2-3 washes the pads have completely fallen apart. I contacted the seller and its been well over a month with no response. Very disappointed in this product and company. The bras are cute, and I like how they fit. I didn't expect anything fantastic at $18 for 3 bras, but I expected them to last more than a week."
4525,3,"I want to start off by stating that I am a 34D, and usually wear medium sports bras. I ordered the large first because of the other reviews, and the size chart saying that they run a little small. It ended up fitting okay, and gave good support, but good lord, the armpit boobs were awful. I figured maybe i just ordered it too small and ordered it again in Xlarge, but again, the armpit boobs were still very VERY visible. I think its the way these bras are designed. They come to a point at the shoulders, and the straps are at an awkward place in the front, and its because of this, that the dreaded armpit boobs persist. I really really wanted to love these, the back straps are so cute! but theres no way I can walk around with 2 extra boobs hanging out the sides."
4526,3,"These are ridiculously small. I couldn't be more disappointed. In the land of bra makers if you aren't fifteen pounds under the minimum healthy weight for your height, you're fat and can't possibly have no bosom. After nursing four kids, there is nothing left up top. Due to massive GI issues I can no longer wear underwire. That means I'm screwed if I want anything that actually contains more than lace to cover all the bits and pieces. This bra did that, but it also dug into my shoulders and caused a lot of pain. Yep, I have a neck and back injury too. While pretty and made with nice material, these are totally unwearable for a thin person who is taller than 4'9"" and can't afford to buy augmentation."
4527,3,"I bought these padded sports bras so I could go about my daily life looking like I actually possessed breasts and then workout when time allowed. They are padded, which is nice, but the material is too giving and reminds me more of a preteen training bra than a sports bra; the bras offer almost no support. They are not discreet, either--the neckline is almost up to my clavicle, so forget wearing any shirt other than, say, a turtleneck if I don't want my bra showing."
4528,1,"My first review: Very cute looking but dark to see through.Then I was happily surprised that SUNGAIT gave me a discount code to buy brand new sunglasses for 99% off I was going to change it to a 5 star review.Thennnn out of no where SUNGAIT sent me “free” sunglasses because my first pair was too dark, only catch was when ups dropped them off they told me I owed a $36 shipping fee because they came from China and went through customs. I didn’t even order this pair! So annoying! Wouldn’t recommend this brand again!"
4529,3,"Very cute BUT I haven't even had them for a month and they cracked at the top of the frame around the lens. I have not put them in a pocket or purse, they have either been in the glasses compartment in my car or I've been wearing them. The day before I went on vacation this week I put them on top of my head when I ran into the store and when I came back to my car I pulled them down to drive home and the lens popped out. Now I've been squinty-eyed my whole vacation to the Oregon coast."
4530,1,"The overall quality was not what I was expecting and the size and fit were not right. Sungait emailed me to see if I was satisfied and offered a refund immediately, apart from Amazon, which they have not honored. They said no return necessary, they would refund or replace with another style. I said I’d like the refund and they wrote back trying to replace them. I did not initiate this, they did. And I have not heard from them since or received the refund that they offered, unsolicited, to me. Not a company I would recommend."
4531,3,"I really wanted to love these. After a couple times wearing them on my honeymoon, they started to get this really odd smell, to the point that I couldn’t wear them anymore. It was so bad that when you wore them, all you smelled was the chemicals. It was an awful stinky smell that wouldn’t wash away. I’m pretty sure it’s the type of material they used to make these or some sort of coating. I wish I could return these, but I think it’s too late. :("
4532,3,"Idk how these got good reviews. I have the mirrored ones, and anytime I wear them in the sun, there is a horrible glare in the sides of the glasses. Then you get a piece of paper inside the box that says you don’t have to return for a refund, so I didn’t, and still haven’t received one. (A refund) my stupid self went on vacation, and threw the box away it came in, and now they want it to give the refund. If you are getting the mirrored ones, save your money. You’ll just get a migraine."
4533,3,These did not block a discernible amount of blue light. I bought this pair and another different pair of blue light blocking glasses. This pair arrived first and I couldn't tell that they were actually doing anything; so I looked for a way to test/check them. I found something on line & couldn't tell a difference when wearing or not wearing the glasses (like you should). I wanted until the other/different pair of glasses arrived and I could see a difference when viewing the test page. I'll be returning this pair (which was actually even more expensive than the pair that worked).
4534,1,"Ridiculously huge, should of read the frame measurements better. Save your money, just very cheaply made frame and the blue anti-reflective coating is the cheapest of the cheap. I talk from experience as I am a licensed optician in the field for 17 years. My sister -in-law doesn’t need any correction but does tons of school work on her computer and wanted the benefits of a blue blocking non-glare coating. So we both purchased a pair ( I purchased because I was curious of the quality of the product). Invest in a good pair from a reputable optical store whether big box or private doctor’s office."
4535,2,I was excited to get these glasses. See I work in an Amazon fulfillment center and we had a pair of glasses like these returned it was a different brand and I couldn't remember. I looked through the lenses to see if they were clean and I was amazed when I looked at my computer. I was like wow I need a pair of these bc I'm always on a computer at work and always reading on my kindle and phone. So when I got home I searched for glasses and decided to order these. When I put them on it was weird. There was a big glare all around the edges of the glasses if you were around the light. They did tone the blue light down on the screens but they strained my eyes so bad I had to take them off. Idk if I had a dud pair or if they are all like these. They are also rather big on your face. I tried them in different lighting settings and the glare just wouldn't go away even looking around the room. As soon as I took them off my eyes felt relief. I would personally not buy these again and I will be looking for a different pair from a different brand.
4536,3,"These glasses are of such poor quality that they will do more damage to your eyes than any minimial blue blocking they do. I have 20/20 vision and found myself squinting to see clearly, and like many other reviewers, got headaches that only went away after taking them off. They are not true blue blockers. I have real blue blockers from my eye doctor (was just looking for a cheap throw around pair) that are a night and day difference from these. Anyone who reviews these high truly doesn't know what they should be getting.If you're going for ""cute"" and don't care about what they do to your eyes over time, then they might work for you. They are also extremely stiff and uncomfortable. Lastly, the glasses came with a major scratch on the lense and are impossible to keep clean. Lense cloths and spray can't even help."
4537,1,"I bought these for work and when looking at the video that was posted about these, there was a noticeable difference shown in the lenses. When getting them, this difference is non-existent. There is absolutely no difference between wearing them and not wearing them. Everything has the same color and blue light.Not to mention the screws on the hinges are so incredibly tight that the plastic squeaks and almost feels as if they'll break. Save your $16. Not worth it."
4538,3,I received these sunglasses on time but when I put them on I immediately knew something was wrong with the fit. I think the sunglasses were squished during transit causing the material to deform. You can’t tell from just visually inspecting the sunglasses. When I wear them they are angled towards the right. I can feel the rim on my right cheek but it’s completely off my left cheek. I am planning on returning them or reaching out the the company for them to replace them. I do like the look and I feel like I will like the feel of it as well once I switch them out for a non defective one.
4539,1,The lense popped out the first time I (attempted) to clean. I accept that I must have a defective pair. When I got ahold of customer (not) service I figured I would get the standard response to such a low priced item. Receive a refund and screw the return. No so. Run around for a $5 refund. I don't think so. No worth the fuel on each end. Threw in garbage and called it a day. Beware a bad batch.
4540,3,"Gave them to a female co-worker who appreciated the color of the lenses more than I do. The pictures make it look like it's red whereas they're actually bright orange. Also can see your eyes through them despite all the mirroring. Clarity is great because these orange lenses don't filter much out. Not what I was expecting at all for my riding needs.Love the frame's shape and feel. The number of accessories you get with these is unbelievable! (2 cloths, case, box) Well packaged. But lenses are unnaturally orange! It's not just personal preference, my male friends did not take to them at all either."
4541,3,"So I ordered the Blue reflective version and taking them out of the packaging I was impressed with the quality of the glasses. Until I put them on of course. I immediately noticed reflections on the inside of the lenses due to the reflective coating on the inside. I had my wife and daughters try them on and they all experienced the same reflections so it wasn't just me. I gave them a go for a week or so to see if I could get used to it but unfortunately not. I contacted customer service to see if maybe I had received a pair of bad lenses and I was told that I had bought the blue mirror lenses and that the insides were not black. That very few people see reflections. They offered replacement all black lenses which were not Blue Reflective as I had ordered. I accepted the replacements which took close to 2 weeks to arrive. Upon receipt I attempted to put the replacements on and noticed that the replacements were significantly bigger and no matter how much I tried they would not fit. Note I have purchases Oakleys in the past and have replaced multiple lenses on glasses. I kept losing them or breaking them which is why I decided to try a cheaper alternative. Anyways, I contacted customer service to let them know of the issue. I even included a picture showing the difference in size which was pretty significant when stacked with the old lens. I was told that ""according to the principle of sunglasses production. To replace the lenses, the new ones need to be bigger than the old ones"". Well after much trying to no avail my wife decided to file the edges down of the new lenses which after after about 30min or so of filing they finally popped in. I was about to throw them out and cut my losses but my wife decided to go the extra mile. A customer should not have to go through this much inconvenience for a pair of sunglasses to actually work correctly."
4542,1,"The temples (the portion of the glasses that stick out and sit atop your ears) are not aligned with the glasses properly, so they end up sitting crooked on your face. When I drive and the sun is on the left side of my face, there's basically no part of the glasses that actually cover the left side of my face because of this misalignment. Guess I got what I paid for here. Absolutely would not recommend these glasses; spend a few extra dollars and get a pair that fit properly!"
4543,3,"Seller contacted me though Amazon (after reading my review) and provided me a full refund. Although my original review of product still stands, lens would not stay in frames on 2 of the 3 pairs and actually now 3rd pair lens started to pop out as well. Seems after wearing a few times frames weaken and lens begin to pop out, they did follow through on the credit they said they were going to issue me.Horrible glasses. Bought three pairs and two pairs the lens keeps falling out. You snap them back in but as soon as you close glasses they pop out again. Two pairs are useless now. No option to contact seller or I would have."
4544,3,"I saw these on Prime Day and needed sunglasses, so I threw down my cash for these bad boys. I'll admit - they look good and came with a decent little carrying case and such.However, I had them for less than 2 weeks I believe, and the right arm just dislodged itself. I didnt drop them, I didnt smack them against anything, and I didn't accidentally press on them too hard. I went to put them on and I felt they were crooked. I looked more closely at the right arm and they hyperextended, causing the angles to be off.In this day in age, I would expect sunglasses to not break so easily. If you get these, you'll need to pamper them considerably."
4545,3,I just received this sunglasses and pulled them out of the package to see that both the right and left lenses were scratched. I even tried to clean the lenses because I thought it was a smudge from my fingers but no. I'm not sure how brand new sunglasses can come with both lenses already scratched when they are in their protective packaging... I know these lenses are cheap and you get what you pay for but I have ordered these sunglasses before and they did not come like this. At least let me scratch them on my own... Will be sending them back for a new pair that is not scratched.
4546,3,"These sunglasses are dangerous to wear while driving due to their reflective properties on both the front and back. The nose pads are very sticky and uncomfortable. They do not do a good job of helping you see when it's bright outside. Be sure to hit 'show more' in the description in order to view all the hidden measurements before ordering.*I updated my rating from one star to two because the company was nice enough to offer a refund that was not previously available. In exchange, I updated my original review on 7/20/18 to a non-biased review on 8/1/18 per their request.***8/7/18: After updating my review by the serller's request, they claimed my refund would be coming within 3 days. After waiting almost a week I never received a refund, but I did receive two more requests asking me to increase the star-rating for this product. I had to reach out to Amazon in order to get my refund.**"
4547,3,"It’s really my fault for not studying the reviews closer. The screws that hold the nose pads in place falls out with ease. Broke on the second day. With this purchase I gave SOJOS $12 and they gave me one less reason to live. But I suppose I should be grateful that it lasted me a whole 48 hours. Like, zoinks Scoob, that’s like, wumbo durability dude. Not really, this product genuinely makes me want to stare into the sun and go blind. But I guess not everyone can get quality child labor these days huh? I could have spent my money better by literally burning it in front of me. At least then I’d have the entertainment of watching the flame slowly consume it. Wish I could rate 0/5 but even that would be too high for what I received. So take this one star, because you’re a superstar. The superstar of shitty products. Your products are more poorly put together than a person with missing chromosomes. It just goes to show that something as simple as sunglasses can be unobtainable when the people who make them are -5 IQ and are are also too lazy to care."
4548,3,"100% not polarized as advertised. These do not help night driving in any way, shape, or form. If anything, these make night driving more dangerous. Does not block glare, just changes the glare to yellow. Quality of the glasses is mediocre at best, but that was expected at this price point. I tried them multiple nights and these are going in the trash. The case was the best part. These are just ugly glasses with yellow tinted lenses. If you want to look stupid, these might be for you, just don't use them to drive."
4549,1,"Do not buy these sunglasses. I purchased them for a trip to Hawaii, as they are on the cheaper end and I wouldn’t care if I lost them. These sunglasses reflected the sun onto my nose to the point that it burned so bad it started bleeding, and I was wearing plenty of sunscreen, as no where else on my face or body burnt.When I went and applied more sunscreen, the chemicals in it caused the black coloring from the plastic of th sunglasses, to come off and run down my face and stained my nose."
4550,3,"This review is for the clear framed (""Crystal""), silver/reflective lensed (""Ice Tech"") version.In short, they're absolutely unusable, for a general reason and a specific reason.The specific reason first: The reflective lenses are so reflective that I could see my own face (eye wrinkles and all) when I wear the sunglasses. It's noticeable in direct sun and out of direct sun. It's trippy and distracting. Secondly, the lenses actually make vision worse. Contrast, glare, and resolution were all worse than wearing no sunglasses in bright sun.The general reason first, and this only applies to clear plastic frames: they look cool, but they refract sunlight, so you end up with all sorts of little hotspots of reflected and refracted and focused light around your eyes, which is incredibly distracting and dangerous. There's a good reason why you don't see many clear frames!"
4551,1,"lens started popping out of lens within 5 days of use. Do NOT recommend.Ice tech lenses are not grey as appear in some photos but silver mirror lenses. I bought these because I was looking for grey/ black polarized lenses on clear frames so I was disappointed they were mirror lenses. However, if you are looking for transparent frames with silver mirror lenses that block your eyes, these do that. I searched the reviews for mention of ice tech before purchasing and there weren't any mentions so I hope this helps others. I would also say these lenses are on the larger side, noticeably larger than my prior women's sunglasses which were listed as Lens width: 54 millimeters; Lens height: 41 millimeters. But these were listed as Lens width: 52 mm; Lens height: 42 millimeters so not sure what's going on there... I have a larger head for a woman and I would prefer lenses a bit smaller and shorter. (So I guess men should feel confident on lens sizing, smaller women not so much) However the fit is good and crucially, they do not fall off when I look down at the ground. Vision is okay for price, but I think I will also repurchase my old pair from Pepper (higher quality lens/higher price tag)."
4552,3,"It turns out that the HD+ amber lenses are NOT polarized, though they are advertised as polarized. When looking at a polarized light source (e.g. an iPad screen, another pair of polarized glasses), there is no change in light transmission for any orientation of the lens. Seeing as it’s the entire point of the company, dropping rating to 1 star.I also ordered a pair of the green lenses, and they are only very weakly polarized. Compared to a pair of $120 Izod polarized sunglasses that cut about 90% of horizontally polarized light, the Polarspex lenses only cut about 10%. The giveaway is that I can still easily read the LCD screen on my phone with these on.If Polarspex are lying about the polarized lenses, I wonder if they’re lying about the UV protection as well. Unfortunately, there’s no easy way to test UV blocking.Seems to be fairly high quality for the money. Hinges are quite stiff out of the package and haven’t loosened up after a couple of days. Fit is good. Looks like the photos. No rough edges or obvious molding lines. Lenses are clear and tint is smooth.Included case is ok for a soft case, but the button snap is difficult to close when glasses are in the case."
4553,2,"These sunglasses are very stylish and were a great fit. I wore them every day for a few hours a day and after just two weeks, all of a sudden, I heard a pop while they were sitting on my head... One side of the frame popped off from where it is anchored near the inside edge of the lens! I had not abused the sunglasses, I took care of them, and the weather wasn't even that hot (around 75 degrees Fahrenheit) when they broke on their own accord.Because I had bought these for a vacation, I decided to keep wearing them even though I looked goofy, because I needed the protection (the lenses are polarized and work really well). Lo and behold, after one more week of wear, the other side popped off while it was sitting on my head again! See photos for clarification.If this issue is fixed in the future I would buy them again, but for now, I will stay away from these."
4554,3,"This review is for blue lenses.When I put them on, I could see the reflection of my own eyes. My friend said that wasn't abnormal, but she was happy to see me get polarized lenses. She's an optometrist and said that was important.I tried using the sunglasses for a couple weeks. I gave up on these lenses because you don't get used to the reflection. It blocks your vision because all you see is these two blue eyes blinking back at you. I complained to my friend, who tried on the glasses. She then admitted the amount of reflection in these lenses is not normal. It's huge and distracting. Many times I had to reorient where I was looking to look around the reflection in the lenses.On the whole, I thought the build quality was nice, but they may have went cheap with the lenses."
4555,2,"I purchased two sets of these sunglasses. I love the styling and actually got many compliments on these. People were surprised they were ""cheap"" sunglasses from Amazon. Most thought they were high-end. The look and the polarized lens were very nice. However, I'm assuming it's a construction or material issue with the frames. The first time it happened, I thought it was due to circumstances. Even though I thought odd that one of the sides broke. So, I purchased a second pair. This pair broke in the identical area using them as I've used every other pair of sunglasses I've owned. These were not treated any differently from other glasses I've owned. They broke in the same area, near the rivet that holds the ear piece to the frame. So obviously there is a defect here. I would purchase another item."
4556,1,"These glasses looked like in person how they seem in the picture. The lenses hd effect worked how I thought it would. Otherwise, they were smaller than I was hoping and there was significant reflection on the inside of the lenses while in use which is always a negative feature for glasses. I think this is due in part to the fact that they let too much light in from the side. On top of this, they broke after only like a week of use. The temple part of the frame is made of cheap plastic and while I was taking them off one day I notice it had warped and had begun to split in two. I had not sat on them or otherwise done anything to warp them so severly. Spend your money on something better."
4557,3,"I loved these sunglasses. I thought it was incredibly clever how they got around making them look like wayfayers with the removable parts that they give you the tools to remove. Very clever design. However, after a month of on and off use the temple snapped in the middle while placing on my head. It was clear the plastic on the temple was not a sturdy as I had thought. Really sad because I loved everything about these sunglasses from the polarization to the design and feel."
4558,1,"These look pretty good at first glance, but they feel like they would snap in half with very little pressure. They are polarized, but for some reason they actually make it harder for me to see things like my phone or my dashboard display while driving. If you are out in sunlight, they create all kinds of glare which is very distracting. I would suggest you spend a few dollars more and get a better made pair of sunglasses that actually sharpen your vision instead of making it worse."
4559,3,"Two glasses for the price of one? Sounded too good to be true, and sadly it was. The frames are nice and light and the temple length was perfect for me, but it’s impossible for me to wear so they’re getting returned.There is a distortion in the lens, which if you only wear the glasses for up to half an hour at a time, probabl wouldn’t be noticable. But I wear my glasses for hours at a time on almost a daily basis. Wore these on a 2.5 hour long road trip when I started getting a headache, the cause being eyestrain. If you have less than 20/20 vision you might never see the distortion, but I noticed objects more than 50 feet away were blurred with the glasses on. Not a good thing, especially when using for driving."
4560,1,"Another junk product. When you view this glass it looks like a high quality sun glass. However, it was totally worthless. As I stated before, this quality of junk can be purchased from a dollar store. I would not recommend it. Furthermore, I was also under the impression Amazon sold quality products, this was a disappointment."
4561,3,"Lightweight and actually polarized (I ordered a pair from another seller that said it was but wasn't). There is a good amount of stretch in the glasses that make it really comfortable to wear, you can hardly feel them yet they are secure enough they don't slide off your face when you bend over. They feel a little flimsy, but haven't broken for me yet. I'm disappointed in the sun protection from the side. I still have to shield my eyes or adjust my head if the sun is at my side because these glasses are really flat with tiny frames that allow a lot of light from the sides."
4562,3,Definitely not polarized. False advertising there. The green and gold pair I got are super cute and fit well. The black pair is smaller and the frame is slightly bent in. They aren’t comfy to wear they are too tight on my head so I doubt I will get any use of them. Overall not a horrible purchase considering how cheap they are but really it’s like only buying one pair of glasses.
4563,3,"I got these for my husband's birthday and we knew they were fake the moment we took them off the case. The glasses were flimsy, and having owned 3 pairs of real Ray-Bans in the past, we know that the quality of these glasses was sub par. It was also obvious to me that they had been used and returned as a prior purchase as the lens were covered in fingerprints, the box they came in was a disaster and the plastic that usually covers the ""legs"" was laying inside the case rather than protecting them. If I could give this product 0 stars I would."
4564,3,"These Ray Bans are fakes. I'm sure it's illegal to call these real. They're not authentic despite their packaging.The engraving on the lens, which is usually an indication of authentic Ray Bans is in the wrong spot and the lenses actually chip and dent because they're made of such cheap plastic.I have had many real Ray Bans and other, high end sunglasses that are in better condition after years of wear.After 4 months of wearing, these are almost unwearable now."
4565,1,"Product was unfortunately a (admittedly well done) pair of fakes. I had to check closely on some things, but the giveaways on mine were: no lens sticker (duh?), shoddy RB etching, and incorrect text spacing inside the left arm.I'm certain there are many people out there that have bought Ray-Bans online thinking they got a deal but are actually rocking replicas. I actually wouldn't mind owning a well-faked pair, but I'm not paying over $100 for them. Guess I'll have to pony up and buy from a brick and mortar store or maybe directly from Ray-Ban. Buyer beware!"
4566,1,"I'm extremely disappointed that it took me 6 months to realize the pair of aviators I bought were fake. Honestly, the only reason I even realized this is because I recently bought an exact pair again (my original pair got stolen....funny now knowing whoever stole them, stole fake ones!) through Amazon and noticed they were a bit different from the ones I initially got. Out of curiosity I decided to check online to see if there were different types of the gold frame/crystal blue gradient lens, but instead I stumbled upon some of the reviews on here (which I probably should have read before purchasing my original pair) stating some were fake. After doing some online research and reviewing the original case, info pamphlet, and lens wiper given to me, I realized the ones I originally purchased were in fact replicas!For those of you buying these aviators, MAKE SURE the pair you are buying are being sold from Amazon, as these are authentic. However, if you see anything being ""sold by Lunettes4me fulfilled by Amazon,"" do yourself a favor and do not buy them. You will be wasting your money."
4567,3,"First of all, I want to mention the name of the seller who sold me this product. GAFFOSI don't understand how this seller have this good rating!!!...They sent me a superb quality fake product. First of all they took the price of the polarized version but sent me a regular version. Moreover that is a fake one. The product failed at least 4 counterfeit buster features.I am using Ray-Ban for more than 9 years. As soon as I saw the Ray-ban logo on the glass I felt I bit uncomfortable but could not identify the problem with that. A closer look revealed the actual story.In the Ray-Ban logo the head of the letter ' R ' starts with thick edge and then becomes a bit thinner. But, the product I got, there the head of the letter ' R ' was equally thing through out its length. And the print is also slightly larger if I am not wrong.Later I found the followings:1) It did not have the square shaped sticker bar-code on the paper box.2) In the nose shoe there is no 'R.B' rather there is 'R B' and the seller intentionally scratched the noes shoe so that it become unreadable.3) In the left leg part of the white print is already gone.4) Moreover, I am writing about a feature. May be this is not correct cause I could not find this feature over internet but discovered myself.I have 4 pairs of Ray Ban's in all of them in one nose shoe in printed in inverted alignment with the other. But the product I got, that has both in same alignment. If anybody can check and verify my observation, please comment."
4568,3,"More and more spots are appearing on this pair of sunglasses. It's like they are corroding or something. I'm so mad! I can't seem to find a way to get in touch with the seller to see about an exchange.At first, I loved these sunglasses- they came nicely packaged and were shiny and sleek. But after 2 or 3 wears- and being very careful not to scratch or get anything on them, they have started to develop spots on the lenses that won't wipe off. I've tried to wiped these spots off, and as time passes, more spots appear!I am SO disappointed!!I was amazed at how nice these are! They came nicely packaged, with a case, soft bag, cleaning cloth, and carabeaner. I bought the polarized purple lenses. They are a nice purple with hints of blue, green, and pink as they turn in the light. A good purchase!"
4569,2,"So the darker picture is looking through the tint in my car and the other is how the glasses look normally. Defiantly NOT polarized, they hardly block the sun, you can see many eyes almost perfectly through the lens. The purple is pretty but not sunglasses. Looking through them through the tint is crazy, it reflects colors (you can see in the picture) and gave me a headache. It’s also mildly distracting while driving. I would not order these again. They will work for what I want which are cute purple glasses while on vacay but I won’t wear them afterwards."
4570,3,"These glasses looked nice, but everything looked VERY purple in them. My husband got them in a different color and when looking through his, everything looked VERY blue. I understand they are colored lenses, but we have others that are similar that give more of a standard tint rather than an overwhelming hue to everytihng. The case that came with them was nice. Quality of the glasses was okay.. about what you'd expect for the price.In the end, we returned these. The hue was too much for us. If that doesn't bother you, then they may work well for you."
4571,1,"These lenses were warped somehow and messed with my vision! I wore them for 30Minutes and my eyes were allMessed up and I had a terrible headache. Tried them again 2 more times, as did my daughter, and they did the same thing! Would like to hear from customer service.Update: customer service was very nice and helpful and replaced my sunnies with another pair in return for an updated review. update: they still suck. they put 99% of their money into the packaging and 1% into the product. i bought these for our road trip, and i bought a pair identical at a TRUCK STOP in Utah and they are AMAZING. don’t buy this garbage."
4572,3,"I wanted to love these, like the other reviewers, but I just can't. I got the mirrored pink ones, and although they look great on, they felt awfully cheap! I couldn't see a thing out of them. There was a glare, and distortion on the lenses. I tried cleaning them, but found that it's part of the lens. They're polarized alright, but very cheaply made. I mean I know they're cheap sunglasses, but they honestly felt like $1 store sunglasses. They're light because they're cheap, cheap, cheap! I found other versions on Amazon for the same price that are way higher in quality. Returned them!"
4573,3,"I ordered this glasses because the specs say they block high-energy blue light. Too bad they failed to please. What I noticed about the glasses I received is there's a permanent horizontal smudge in my line of vision. It seems to divide the lens in half with the top part being amber and the bottom being somewhat blue. The back of the lens has a substantial amount of glare compared to the other brands I own, which further adds to the discomfort. I ordered mine in the tortoise frame. Aside from having rough edges, this frame ought to be discontinued because light from overhead light fixtures glares through the frame in rainbow colors, interfering with my vision. Also, when I look at a light source, I see an intense blue around the bulbs. Some glasses do this, while others do not. It makes me wonder if our eyes are indeed being protected."
4574,1,Horrible product.It looks nice but i can tell that the plastic lens is the cheapest and it actually gives me blurred visions and headache because of that. Overall wearing this is so uncomfortable that i constantly want to take it off. Lenses are not anti-glare at all. They are so reflective that i can even feel it while wearing. I bought it solely for blue light blocking and i don’t feel any less eye strain at all. It just gives me more headache/ blurred vision/ discomfort. Very disappointed and I recommend everyone to invest more and get a legit one instead.
4575,3,"WAY too small, felt like child glasses on my face. And I started to get a headache as the arms ever so slightly apply pressure to the temple. I would suggest not wearing them for more than a couple hours. I really like the look, however I'm disappointed in these glasses. Within the first week of wearing them, part of the plastic rim fell off after only wearing them 3 times. I was looking forward to wearing them, but I have been hesitant to wear them, as I don't want them to fall apart even more. Despite these glasses not being all that expensive, I didn't expect them to fall apart like they came from the dollar store, hence the low score."
4576,3,"I really like these glasses but I will not be rating 5 stars for them, more so three or two....Only because the glasses don’t fit in the case properly causing them to bend easily, the material it’s made is horrible, I wish they weren’t so flimsy and made better... I wouldn’t pay for these again... if it was made better I’d be rating five stars but I apologize in saying I’ll be rating this product one stars, due material, does not fit in case properly, and poorly made; glasses feel flimsy, easy to bend/break."
4577,3,"I really like these glasses! The look, design, functionality are rated a 5! They work great when it comes to looking at my laptop and phone everyday and they stay on my face, although I think I’m allergic to the silicone nose pads. (The pads that sit on your nose bridge).I’m rating these a 2 star because I got a allergic reaction after maybe 3 hours from wearing it. I have a dry red rash on my nose bridge & it sucks:(In the photo I added black tape so the silicone nose pad don’t get in skin contact with my nose bridge.It’s not the company’s fault at all, no hate or shade to Donna eyewear- I just found out my skin has a allergic reaction to silicone plastic. It’s the same reaction to wearing fake silicone clear bra plastic straps. I’m still trying to figure out what kind of plastic I’m sensitive to. But I’m 80% it’s silicone. Looking into finding vinyl nose pads.Don’t know anyone else who has this problem. It’s been 3 days with trying to treat my skin with overdose moisturizer and time."
4578,3,These feel like children's glasses because the lens is so SMALL. They need to be pushed all the way up your nose for the lens to cover your eyes. They will not reach your brows or your cheek. Will probably return and get adult-sized glasses. Not joking--these might literally be children's glasses.
4579,3,"Thank you for the invitation to review your product.Glasses from Success Eyeware are smaller and heavier (by almost 20%),when compared to glasses from KerecsenOptics. Plus glasses from KerecsenOptics came with a useful case.Images on the two Amazon websites looked identical, so I thought productswould be the same. Sorry I didn't send both orders to KerecsenOptics."
4580,3,One pair of glasses lost the screw in its hinge during the first week of use making them unusable. I notified the seller but have not received a replacement. I like the glasses appearance but I am disappointed with the quality and seller responsiveness.
4581,3,"Why have I had dozens of these glasses? Because I have been to lazy to look for a different pair. They look fine (meaning they're all black) and they last about 1 month before they break. I had started putting little tags on them, like they do to track animals like sharks, lions, etc. But that doesn't seem to work because there's a thief (or stalker) who breaks into my house and steals these, usually along with a sock."
4582,3,"I won't give this product one star as I admit the lenses seemed fine for the price. The issue here is the measurements of the glasses and nowhere on the product page will you find it. What should be a clue for all is the fact these glasses are advertised for men and women. As a man, I should have assumed that they would be too small for me as I consider my head to be relatively large. In fact, in selecting reading glasses from another seller I made sure the information mentioned only men's styles and included the width of the frame and the length of the arms. I suspect for most men they will encounter the same issue I encountered."
4583,3,"The screw connecting one of the arms is constantly coming completely loose and will easily fall out. Of course it's not the end of the world lol. I've just gotten in the habit of twisting the screw back in a couple times each day. I've thought about gluing it in place, but I don't want to void the warranty. I have tried tightening it very tightly. It will always come loose again. I would just rather not deal with a screw literally constantly unscrewing each time up open the arms. I plan to contact the company for a replacement soon, or some solution to keeping the screw in place."
4584,3,WAY too big of frames to call unisex. These are definitely geared towards the male population. There’s nothing about them that should put them in the unisex category. I bought two pair and had to return both. They did come with a nice case and cloth though so that’s where the two stars came from.
4585,3,"After lots of research to find glass lens polarized sunglasses, I chose BNUS. I knew size was important, so I checked the width carefully. I ordered polarized green lenses in a tortoise frame. After keeping them 3 days and wearing them on the patio in sunlight and looking across a pond in back, I returned them for a refund for 3 reasons: 1) I've worn polarized sunglasses for many years, and if these were polarized, I couldn't tell. Glare with or without the glasses was the same. True test, I couldn't see into the water beyond the surface. 2) Fit of temples was tight against my head even though the glasses measure wide. 3) Hinges were OK, but nothing that looked like they would hold up with years of wearing. I have RayBans that I've used for 20+ years, and these BNUS glasses don't compare. I concluded these are satisfactory glasses that come in a fancy cloth bag and fancy box with a cleaning cloth. Much of the $50 cost was in the extras, not the glasses. I'll keep looking."
4586,3,I love the look of these and the color. They appear to be made well but are much smaller than they appear online. I would love to be able to have them replaced with a pair that looks almost identical but is larger. They are very narrow and you cannot tell that by the images I have seen. Hoping that the company will reach out to me and offer to exchange for a larger pair so I can change review.
4587,3,Appear to be decent quality. If my opinion changes after prolonged use I will update this review. Even with glass lenses this pair is not all that heavy I was surprised. Lens is a very clear with minimal distortion. Almost on par with but not quite as distortion free as my Ray-Bans and Maui Jim's . Plan on using this pair as my ocean fishing suglasses. I have current pair of Costas which are over priced and over rated. These seem just as good and if not better because there are no rubber pieces to wear off on the nose bridge which all Costas do over time.Would have given it 4 stars but one important design flaw..... they use solid hinges no Springs after a while these are bound to break with constant on and off. Even cheapo Foster Grants in the grocery store come with spring hinges today....not sure why they cut the corner on this..... time will tell.
4588,3,I took a chance and ordered these thinking there was a possibility they would be the real thing. Sure enough they are a dupe. As you can see in the pictures the fading is uneven. The letters uneven. They are supposed to say “Quay x Desi” not “Quay Australia”.... Honestly I would have worn them had I been able to see through one lens having shade & the other lens not having shade. I thought I was blind when trying them on until I noticed the reason. Anywho will be returning.
4589,1,"I wanted to love these because I am a huge fan of Quay and Desi Perkins. The overall look is great, but aside from that, I hated them. There is some type of mirroring on the inside, (or maybe it's because of how big they are) so when you are outside in the middle of the day you can see the reflections of things behind you, which is very distracting and gave me a huge migraine. I also hated that they weren't UV ray protected. Isn't that the reason we buy sunglasses, to protect our eyes from the damaging rays from the sun?? The size, shape, and look are very flattering even with my round face, but I would definitely recommend buying something different, especially for the price."
4590,3,"I loved these sunglasses when I got them, but now after only 4 months I can't keep them on my face. They've become so loose that they just slide down on my nose. My sister had the same problem with hers and said her friend did as well. They scratch so easily and the case they come with doesn't protect so good. I have $15 sunglasses in this same style that are older and were worn more often that held up much better. I am not rough on my glasses either, when they weren't being worn they were always in the case. I think a lot of the scratches came just from sliding into the case."
4591,3,Was looking to a less expensive alternative to my Porsche sunglasses to wear on an upcoming trip...these are not it. Let's start with the shipping. These arrived in a bubble mailer...possibly the worst shipping option for delicate sunglasses. The first pair I ordered arrived bent and uneven. I received a replacement...also sent via bubble mailer. I tried them on and the sunglasses were uneven again. I know they aren't expensive sunglasses but the frames feel flimsy and cheap even for $60. The mirrored lenses are nice but not as opaque as photos make them seem. They run VERY wide. The case that comes with them is flimsy plastic. Not worth more than $20. Returning.
4592,3,"Not only did I recieve the wrong glasses BUT the lenses are scratched, the glasses are bent. There is absolutely no way that these glasses are brand new. I ordered the gold high key's and recieved black frames with black lenses and overall just horrible quality. They will be going back today! Order at your own risk. Images: All the little white flecks on image 1 are scratches, Image 2: you can see the scuff marks and scratches clearly visible on the lenses, Image 3: there is a huge blob of what looks like paint on the inside of the lense. These glasses look like they were thrown in the bottom of someone's purse for months, retrieved and then sent to me. I'm so upset!"
4593,3,"The initial quality exceeded expectations. Comes with a very nice lint free bag and solid zip-up case, and build seems solid. So why not higher rating? Golden reflection lenses actual transmit blue light, so everything looks 'cool' Fit was comfortable, but shape seemed flat on the front, then more curved on edges. The real killer though was in high movement activities, such as tumbling on grass with my Dog, at which point the bridge began rubbing and irritating my eyebrow bridge. If you don't mind the blueish tint, and aren't using for high movement activity, though, the quality is solid, and they are very comfortable."
4594,3,"Almost immediately after I received this product, the lenses started falling out. They are unusable. Unfortunately there is no contact phone number on the manufacturer's web site which lists only a China address :-( . Upon attempting to submit a warranty claim by email from their website, I got an error message that there was an error in processing the email. What a joke!"
4595,1,"BUYER BEWARE!!!!!! Let me start by saying that I bought the Blue Lens with the Silver frames. I bought them for two reasons. 1. The picture showed them to be Mirrored, and the description, when you click on the style, did not say ""Not Mirrored"". See picture attached, you be the judge if they are mirrored like the picture that the Manufacture provided. 2. The first line under the product description said ""HD Polarized"". Well, that line of the description is not accurate. The manufacture claims that the lenses are HD. That is not true. They are polarized and that's it. Only 5 of the 11 different styles are labeled with a ""Not Mirrored"" in the color description. With the exception of the yellow color lenses, all of the other colored lens pictures show a MIRRORED lens. Even the ones that are labeled ""Not Mirrored"" I'm pretty sure this is not legal. I believe that it would fall in the lines of bait and switch. The manufacture or seller shows you one thing that they are selling and then gives you another. Needless to say, I am returning these glasses. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANY OF THESE GLASSES BECAUSE OF THIS!!!!!"
4596,3,"The part of the ear piece that sits on top of, goes behind your ear is a texturized rubber type material. Seems like a pretty good idea, but I found it rubbing on my skin and irritating the skin after 30 minutes. Fairly cheap feeling, though I didn’t expect too much more for the price. I think the glasses that cost about the same from local bj’s are better quality. The sunglasses were also somewhat wide for my face;I have small to average adult male head. The sunglasses also sit forward off my face-not a snug fit the way I like it. Looking up or down, I can clearly see lots of space between my eyes and the sunglasses, thus may not block sun satisfactorily for some. Overall, cheap feel, weird fit. I can confirm they are polarized, and the lenses themselves are adequate-was hoping for slightly better clarifying for driving, but also not impressed with sunglasses for driving."
4597,1,"Yes, they will do what they are supposed to do...basically. Do you think they were designed for giants? Or peoples eyes that were two feet apart? Holy crap are these are horribly designed. They look awesome in pictures, but you can tell they did NOT do any studies or trials on peoples faces. I have a""normal"" sized face, forehead, and cheeks and these things make my face look like it was shrunk down to about a pig-mi face . When I first put them on when I was playing golf, (which is why I bought them) it split the vision or I had two open spots. Just horrible and cant return them now. Not worth saving the money. You get what you pay for."
4598,3,"This is the first review I have ever taken the time to post. I loved (-ed past tense) these sunglasses. They look great, the packaging I received them in portrayed professionalism, and I got a lot of compliments on them. I have had them for 3 months and they are broken beyond repair. This was the final let down of a few that I will list from the time of purchase until now. When I first received these 3 months ago, I opened them up and was blown away by the packaging and all the little extras they give you. I quickly noticed that one of the screws connecting the plastic frames to the wood was not as far in as the other side. I attributed this to a lack of or slip in quality control and they still felt sturdy and seemed to work as intended so I looked past it and started using them and went on my way. Fast forward a month and I noticed there is (what I assume to be a polarization sticker) a layer of something on the lenses that is starting to lift at the edges of the lenses. It was noticeable and I wondered how many times I was looking people in the eyes with them on and they have noticed it. This continued to get slightly worse and more noticeable as time went on. Fast forward to the 2 month mark and this is when I noticed the wood on the right side where the screw was sticking out slighty is now much looser than the other side. No problem, this happens with any pair of glasses over time, I just need to tighten the screw. Well when I go to tighten the screw, it doesn't budge. It seems like its locked in place. So instead I plan on loosening the screw to then try tightening it back down. Well when I started to turn the screw to loosen it mind you, not tighten, the metal attached to the plastic frames that has a small hole for the screw to go into breaks off. Thus rendering the sunglasses now unusable. I give them 1 star because I love the way these look and another star because they kept my eyes comfortable in the sun and because of the affordable price which I guess probably ends up being their downfall. They are cheap and apparently you get what you pay for."
4599,3,The worst pair of sunglasses ever. For $25 I expect a decent pair of sunglasses. Calling these glasses poor is an understatement. Upon opening the package one of the lenses was not in the frame. I quickly realized the front of these glasses are some generic made in China want to be Ray Ban frame. Both the lenses and the front frame of the glasses are extremely poor quality and sizing is a bit small. The lenses throw off a lot of glare both front and back. Not to mention they get dirty really easily and the smallest amount of dirt will make it hard to see. The arms look cool but that's about it. Both of them are completely different sizes and different thicknesses. One arm has nice sanded edges where the other one does not. One arm is extremely thick while the other one is a more appropriate size. I just don't understand how someone can sell glasses this bad. The list goes on and on about how bad these glasses are.
4600,3,"I was really looking forward to owning a pair of sustainably sourced wood glasses but to my dismay, they cracked after no more than a week of use. The wooden component literally splintered and broke as I went to put them on, absolutely ridiculous. I hope their customer service reaches out to do their best to resolve the issue. Otherwise, save your money and get something else. Also, the company should probably save their money on all the bs extras that come with the glasses i.e guitar pick, tattoos, etc. and deliver a better quality product. Abysmal."
4601,3,"I’m sorry, I don’t normally do this but I have to.They broke. Split right through the screw that attached the arm to the lenses. Tbh they seemed defective when I got them - I could see a tiny hairline fracture where they eventually broke. Problem was, I was headed to Europe the next day and needed them to work. Day 4 of my holiday and they just broke.Shame though, because I really like them. As a guy with a big head, finding comfy, trendy dummies are hard. These would’ve fit the bill if they didn’t break. As I said, unfortunate but it is what it is."
4602,3,So I waited a couple months to give a complete review. Within those couple of months I’ve noticed the hinging setup used to connect the pieces has became loose and today I noticed that they no longer fit on my head without either sitting at a slant or falling off easily. The hinges have opened up and the glasses seem to have lost their ability to hold onto my head. I honestly thought the finish on the frame would be the first part to go but so far it seems to be holding up. Straight out of the box i could feel the low quality in the hinges but did not want to jump to a conclusion. It’s apparent that Woodies needs to come up with a better method for connecting the pieces. One star because the item no longer serves its purpose.
4603,2,"Received these March 30. Haven’t even had them a month and the arm snapped right off with normal usage. I treat sunglasses delicately and have kept them in the case when not in use, this doesn’t seem like the normal lifespan of a pair of sunglasses so I am very disappointed with the quality. Would have otherwise rated these very highly for fit, style, price, and sun protection. Thanks anyway, moving on to other companies."
4604,3,"Update: After 1 month of wear one of the screws came out. No problem, it happens. I had it replaced at my normal eye doctor when I went in for a visit. $10- ok pretty annoying but whatever. Well now 2 months later, the other screw fell out at some point and I lost the arm to re-attach. I really loved the glasses and they are a great price. But I expected them to last at least 6 months- which they didn’t.I order stuff from Amazon daily and yet I hardly ever write reviews. I put these in my cart and ordered something a few days later forgetting they were in my cart. I’m glad I “accidentally” ordered them. Really cute glasses and really good quality! I will definitely be ordering from this company again when I need new, not expensive sunglasses!"
4605,3,"I really loved these and they looked more expensive than the low cost, but they only lasted a week. After wearing them a full day at the beach, they warped really bad. I tried to unwarp, but they snapped.As a side note: They never left my face or head that day. When I took them off, I folded them and put them on my bureau. The next day they were too warped to wear."
4606,3,"The glasses themselves are awesome, my low score is because I ordered the Taupe colored frames but recieved Teal....twice. I thought it was just a fluke my first order, and because I liked the sunglasses so much decided to keep the Teal pair and just place another order for Taupe and once again received TEAL. According to the barcode on the packaging (picture for reference) it seems like something is mislabeled in the warehouse so I can't even try to order the pair I originally wanted.The sunglasses are great so far and the case they come with is nice and sturdy. Would be 5 stars if I could just get the color I wanted."
4607,3,I bought a pair of these sunglasses last year and loved them! But early this summer I noticed that there was a film on lenses that would not come off. So I purchased another pair in black. It’s been about 3 weeks and yesterday when trying to open them up to put them on the front part of the frame completely broke off and the right side of the frame broke into two.
4608,3,"Update: Changing my rating to 1, cuz these get scratched up very very very easily, and one scratched, the view is horrible, and distorted. Can't even keep them on for 5 mins, before I start feeling dizzish. Despite the seller description that these are scratch resistant, and distortion free, these are not!! Also, these glasses are smudge magnets, and hard to stay clean.I'll give it a 3.5. Will update later if it holds well overtime. Feels very light in hand, borderline flimsy. Not a great feel wearing it. Doesn't fall off. Medium will not fit most males, but would be a perfect fit for females with faces on the smaller side. I would recommend ordering a Larger size.It's good for what you pay for."
4609,3,"I paid 16.99 for what amounts to $5 glasses. You can easily pick up a better quality pair of glasses at the local pharmacy for 20 bucks. My review then is based on the value versus the price. The lens are incredibly cheap. The build quality is clean but having owned many glasses I can tell that these will not survive bending or faxing of any kind. I will give them to my kid. It comes with a decent case that I will repurpose for another pair of glasses I have that I care far more about than these. For those who say what did you expect for 16, I would say, not a 5 pair of glasses that tare far from premium and should never be confused with military anything. You could not use these in the field under any circumstances."
4610,3,"I'm dumb and didn't realize that these came in two sizes and got the smaller size. I live in the US, a place where we have been to the moon and do not use the metric system so even if I had seen that there were two sizes, I don't own a measuring apparatus that will tell me how long said mm really is. Either way that ones on me. Moral of the story is that they are smaller that I expected for a pair of aviators. Not too small but if you have a head the size of Charles Barkley, pick the bigger size and do yourself a favor. I ordered the black frames and the black lenses. These are dark, really dark. Cant see your eyes dark, cant wear inside dark, and almost as dark as the dark side of previously mentioned US conquered moon dark. After a little adjusting in the sun, I got used to them and it was good. I cant comment on the other infinite shades of the rainbow that these things come in. The quality is what you would expect for the price. Not terrible but by no means amazing. Case....ehhh toss it. Its more for packaging reasons anyways. Lets be honest, if you are buying these you would rather spend more money on a taco Tuesday bar tab than you would to protect your eyes from the deadly rays of light emitting from a nuclear fireball in the sky and you can always buy another pair.After a few days wearing these things they are almost unwearable. Unless the sun is more or less in front of you, the light reflects off of the inside of the lenses and blinds you. I could bend them so that they curve and don't let as much blinding light in but I am willing to bet they will snap before they more a mm, however far that is....Also they took a small tumble from about counter height and one of the lenses popped out..Snapped it back in but still....maybe that is why they send a case?"
4611,3,"I have owned many many polarized sunglasses. From cheap wal-mart glasses to Maui Jim's and Ray-Bans.These lenses are the worst I have ever used. I didn't think twice about buying ""cheap"" polarized glasses because even wal-mart lenses were fine and provided no major issues. These lenses on the other hand are terrible. They are much darker than a normal lens, they cause different light to be let through with small changes in head position such that the sky almost looks like a hologram switching from nearly white to dark blue based on small head movements.Every other pair of polarized sunglass lenses I have worn provide a nice clean filter of polarized light where every color ""pops"". These are the polar opposite (no pun intended). Everything looks murky and inconsistent. Frames are also cheap feeling but that was expected based on price. The lens issues were not expected."
4612,3,"I am not sure what it is with this pair of sunglasses, but I guess they're for people with a specific type of eye vision. I bought them to have an extra and special pair of sunglasses that I'd wear when going out on my weekends. The few times I would wear them, I would start getting sick from wearing them. I don't know why, but because of that I've had to throw them away. I was feeling the sickness in my stomach and some dizziness in my head. You should probably check with your eye doctor before purchasing them to see if it's worth the buy."
4613,1,"First of all, the glasses do block blue light and it comes with a little blue flashlight and blue-sensitive card to prove it. What's interesting is that my regular UV coated glasses do block a lot of the blue light already using the same test, but these glasses add another 15% to around 90%.Everything else about the glasses is horrendous. Everything about these glasses is cheap. The plastic frames look and feel like those 3D throw-away glasses you get at the theater. The lens is the cheapest quality so as you wear these glasses, the image is a little blurry as if you're looking through a piece of plastic from a soda bottle. It seems the ONLY coating on these lens is for blue-blocking without any other like oleophopic so they are extremely prone to smudges from the oil on your hands and face. Wearing the glasses too close to your face will cause your eyelashes to brush against the inner part of the lens and smudge it. You'll have to wipe the lens several times a day.The most horrendous aspect of these glasses is that they're totally flat. If your head is shaped like a brick, then these will fit nicely. If you're like most people with a contoured profile, these glasses will leave a huge gap on the sides of your face, so what effectively happens is that the ambient light will actually reflect off the inner, edge-side of the lens and cause GLARE. As I wear these glasses to look at the computer, I actually see additional glare from the reflection on the inner side of the lens. It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen."
4614,3,"I spend a lot of time working on my laptop or looking at my phone, so I figured a pair of these blue light blocking glasses would be useful. Once I received the glasses, which were packaged nicely in a white cardboard box, which a little tough to pry open, I saw a magnetic glasses case with the glasses nicely wrapped in an opaque sleeve with a lens cleaning cloth in a clear sleeve. I took the glasses out of their packaging and picked them up, only to feel that they were incredibly light and thin to the extent that they feel fragile and flimsy. They feel as if they're easy to break, especially if dropped. When I put them on, the first thing I noticed was that the frame fits really well and doesn't compress or add much pressure to the face, but there was a part of the lenses, especially the right one, where I couldn't see much. When I was wearing the glasses, I couldn't see through the top left and the top right of the left and right lenses, respectively, because there were blue dots blocking my vision. I took them off to carefully observe why I couldn't see through those parts of those lenses, only to see that the top parts of both lenses, especially the right lens, had this layer that was peeling off, like when there is an anti-reflective coating put on your glasses, but over time, it starts to peel and leaves this trail where it peeled off. Basically, I can't see too well through the top half of the lenses unless I tilt my head because of the peeled off layer on the lenses.I did try to take pictures of the peeling coatings on the lenses as soon as I saw them, but they weren't showing up on a camera. It's too bad. I really hoped I could show the defects."
4615,3,So the blue light they send with the testing card is a gimmick I totally fell for from other reviews. “Wow if they send a blue light AND the card to prove their glasses work they must REALLY work right”? Nope. Well they do filter the light they send but they don’t really filter blue light AND don’t filter any better than wearing sunglasses and only marginally better than my regular glasses. Sending these ones right back.
4616,3,"I loved the look of the frames on these glasses, however, when I wore them for the first time, after a few minutes I developed a headache. I thought it was just me so I kept wearing them for a little while longer. The headache got worse, so I took them off. When I took them off, my headache went away. I tried this several more times throughout two days. I compared them to my other blue light blocking glasses and I didn't have a headache when I wore my other pair of a different brand. I did noticed that the glass had a weird film on them. Almost looked like an oil slick rainbow type effect when put in the light and the plastic glass just did not look high quality. I gave them a fair shot, I really wanted them to work, but I ended up returning them after a few days."
4617,3,"I spend a LOT of time on the computer, hence my purchase of a very high-resolution monitor that delivers sharp images with no shadowing or blurring. These ANRRI glasses looked promising upon opening the package ... attractive, seemingly well-made. I took off my current +1.75 computer readers (great glasses, excellent image, but getting worn and scratched) and put the ANRRI glasses on only to find out that at ANY distance from the monitor, I was looking at blurry, ghosted images. I could not achieve a clear image no matter what I tried. I have never encountered this issue with magnifying readers before, computer glasses or otherwise. These are going back. I'll move on to my second choice and try again. EDIT: I added the second star only because they look good."
4618,3,"These aren't the best glasses I've worn, but they're not the worst. They look more book-ish than chic. I wear fake glasses as accessories to complement my look, but these take away attention from it because they're so thick. It might be that they just don't compliment my face shape well. It's a shame because they're so cute!"
4619,3,"I bought this for a Tina Belcher costume as they looked a lot like hers. Very good quality for the price. They did not fall apart at all and the lenses stayed in place perfectly. However, they're extremely reflective, which is a huge red flag for spotting fake glasses. Also, they have this sort of cheap plastically smell to them that doesn't go away no matter how many times you wear it. Instead, the smell kind of gets caught in your hair. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase as an addition to a costume, but seeing that a lot of people here bought these for fashion, not sure I'd say they're convincing enough for everyday use."
4620,1,"Purchase these glasses with the intent to install my prescription lenses in them, only to find out that these are non-optical frames. Meaning they are cheap, finicky, and not made for replaceable lenses.Was very disappointed since I have a pair of glasses similar to these, that I bought from UrbanOutfitters [Who no longer sells them], but those frames broke and I just wanted another pair to replace them :(.Would not recommend buying."
4621,3,Packaging was great but shipping took a little while. About these for kids so they can use with prescription lenses but these frames are made for fashion not for actual glasses prescription unless it's a very mild prescription. They are not made like medical glasses that need a screw to hold in the lens. Just a heads up this did not have that screw. These are mainly for Cosmetic fashion purposes.
4622,1,"Broke after 3 weeks of using them.Be aware that not all the optical labs will work with them to change the plastic glass for prescription purposes. Why? The plastic is pretty cheap. Basically, they told me that if the lab work with them will probably broke due to the quality of the plastic (apparently they use some air-pressure process). Fortunately, I found a lab that took off the plastic part and worked with them, only with the metal frame. However, they were really concerned about the quality of the product aaaand guess what? They were right.For the price, the product is good and they look pretty good too (Received a lot of compliments of and for them), but I will not recommend this product for prescription purposes. My vision is blurry AF so now I'm screwed for a couple of days."
4623,3,"The glasses fit really well (I have a big head). I looked how they looked on my face, but I could see my eyelids in the reflection of the interior lenses. I tried them originally indoors under the kitchen lights and then waited for the morning to test them outside. The reflection is too much to bare. I returned them. Keep in mind, this was with the blue lenses."
4624,1,Don't waste your money I bought an equivalent pair at Wally World and they were better quality than these. The frame that goes around your ear is kind of flimsy rubbery and the lenses are warped as you can see in the pictures. This is definitely noticeable when you turn your head side to side or up and down. I tried putting the lens back to lay flat and I couldn't.
4625,1,"These sunglasses look great, though the lines are a bit severe. The problem is the poor quality of the earpieces. The screws that hold them on constantly loosen with only occasional opening and closing. Additionally, each earpiece is held on with two screws. The first time I tried to tighten them, one was already stripped and simply went around and around. I started avoiding opening and closing the earpieces by simply leaving them already opened in my car. That worked for several months. Then I took them with me on a trip to France in June 2019. Within days, one of the earpieces had come off and its screw lost. I went to a discount store and replaced them with a pair that cost 1 euro (about $1.20). They were if anything slightly more stylish and though obviously flimsy seemed of nearly equivalent quality, except on these the screws did not loosen. Bottom line: not worth the money. Go to the supermarket or drug store and buy a pair for half the price or less."
4626,2,This is the second pair of these sunglasses I have ordered. The first pair was fine but they cracked at the top after 6-8 months of daily wear. At $12.00 there is nothing really to complain about. So I bought another pair and wore them on a recent road trip. After 5 hours of driving I took the glasses off and the bridge of my nose was black. The plastic dye must have came off on my nose. It continues to do so after wearing them any length of time. This might be an isolated incident or a quality issue with this pair alone. Not sure if I would buy again.
4627,3,For the price these are nearly unbeatable. They look stylish and come with a case/tools. I appreciate that they are polarized and have decently lenses BUT my particular pair has a smudge that seems to be a manufacturing defect on the left lens right where you look through. While it is distracting its not a deal breaker. Yes i have cleaned them with proper solution and a microfiber cleaning cloth and the smudge/imperfection remains. I would buy them again if they were to be lost or broken.
4628,2,Hello a normal order my work informs but thus time I open the pack days after I got it I had to black packs one was the top and me thanking something change and y’all put the bottom in a pack along so when I went to open the packs to wear to work I had 2 tips and two buttons but my top was my size and the open the paints wonder what I got I had 2 paints one size large wish looked like a size small and the other was a 2x which really looked like a large I look at them saying to my self what is this how could you get this wrong I have Oder before and was very please but not I don’t no about order any more inform through you all and the good part had done through away the pack it can in Sad....
4629,3,"I purchased the navy color scrubs as school require. But the navy color is way too dark and closer to black. School does not accept it and I have returned and purchase from somewhere else. Cost too expensive on the mistake. :( if not there is not emought quantity from prime, I would not purchased from other seller. Since I do not have any intention of return when I buy it.I attached the picture, so, you can see how dark the navy is. Almost looks like black color.I do love the size and style, it fits me perfectly. Unfortunately, the color is a pain."
4630,1,I was looking for a new pair of scrubs for my new job and came across these. I was convinced with this Brand because of all of the good reviews. After 2 hours of use I noticed my nails were stained blue from putting my hands in my pockets!! I’ve tried soap and hand sanitizer but it won’t come off! I’m so disappointed I had to walk around with stained blue nails.Another thing I didn’t like was the sizing. I ordered an XS and the shirt still looked HUGE on me. You can see it more in person as I walk.Both the pants and shirt felt pretty stiff and cheap.If you’re going to be using these scrubs often or for long periods of time I DO NOT recommend them!! Save yourself some money and pay a little extra for better quality scrubs. I now learned my lesson.
4631,1,"After having my baby for the first time and going from a size XS to a M I had to buy all new scrubs (I bought 8 sets, each a different color!!). I picked these because the reviews were favorable, and I could get a whole set for a great price!The Pros:The color is very true and the fabric feels niceExchanging sizes was easy from PRIME sellers (one other set -not prime- wasn’t that great because I had to pay to return it myself). The only other thing that was wonderful about them was the price ( in this case you get what you pay for).The Cons:The fabric was coming apart at every seam after washing it once!! And I’m talking about EVERY ONE before I ever even wore them! Aside from some less than great stitching they seemed fine until I wore a brand new outfit to work and somehow during the course of the one day got a hole in the pants (right were a seam was... no surprise)The shirts also seem to be too large for the pants size and you can’t mix/match the sizes for a set.I wasted $140 on these trying to save a few bucks but it looks like now I’ll be going with brands I know AND be stuck with sewing these together as long as possible.Don’t make my mistake and just go buy the damn good ones...For picture reference I’m 5’9 and 140lbs."
4632,3,"I just received this on Purple. I bought a burgundy set last week in Medium. Loved the fit and decided to get the purple one, too. Also purple. The burgundy arrived neatly pressed and folded in a plastic package. The purple scrubs were rolled up in a bag. The worst part is that the Purple Scrubs are smaller than the burgundy scrubs. They're both a size medium, same design. I can't get this purple scrub top on. It's too tight. The difference may seem slight but it's significant when you need that extra space for a slightly larger chest and not look baggy or too tight. I'm returning the purple ones."
4633,2,Way too big. Will never buy again. Don’t recommend at all. Sizes are 2.5X the normal size. Sorry I bought them. Don’t think about buying any. Not worth your time and effort. Sitting with xxxx lg pant that do not fit and are way too long. Shame on the seller. I’m tired of buying items online and having to return. It’s defeating the purpose of not shopping in stores. They need to keep the stores open so people can go and try and buy instead of online store who knowingly sell people items that are way too big. I’m one angry online shopper. And to know that I bought more than three to make my life easier. No it made my life hell. Had to go to another site to buy again.
4634,3,"Okay honestly I just got these for a Halloween costume, I don’t actually wear scrubs or work in a hospital. I do work a manual labor job, though, and with that experience I do think the quality of the fabric is decent.My biggest complaint is the sizing.. I’m like about 5’4, so honestly I know a ton of women that are smaller than me. Women that I would refer to as petite. People mostly think I’m just average sized, because I’m really not that short. But I ended up buying the petite small pair anyway, since I know a lot of pants end up being too long for me. Even the petite sized scrub pants are too long. They definitely drag on the floor, which wouldn’t be too much of an issue if the waist band was actually elastic and hugged my waist enough. I could have hitched these up a little higher and it would have been fine except the waist is too big too! I mean there is an elastic that would help fit someone bigger but honestly it these are too big and too long for ME I don’t know how anyone smaller than me or shorter than me could wear any of these sizes."
4635,2,"I received the Cherokee scrub pants and I was very happy with them at first. They fit great and looked good. After the 2nd time I wore them however, I saw that the material beside the seam was pulling apart. It wasn't the actual seem, but the material next to it. I contacted Amazon and they sent me replacements. That was great except the replacement pants did the same thing after I wore them once. Very cheap material by Cherokee!! I won't be ordering them again - I'll go with a different brand. Very disappointing!!"
4636,2,"I ordered this pant several months ago and found the medium to fit perfectly. I ordered another pair recently in medium in black instead of the navy and it is huge. It may be mislabeled as it fits like a large would. I have not lost weight. I have washed it several times thinking maybe it would shrink a little, but it still fits like clown pants. The only way I can wear it and have them stay up is to safety pin the waist. I am very disappointed and dissatisfied. It is not worth the hassle of sending back. the construction of the pant is great, but with such variance in sizing I do not feel comfortable in buying again."
4637,3,"I am going to keep them and decided to give two stars instead of one. I worked an extra shift last night and was desperate for clean scrubs so I had to wear these. I wore a pair of lightweight cotton shorts under them and that kept my skin safe from irritation. Yay! So I have at least some way of making these pants work. I do like the pockets on these and the stretchy waist band since I hate drawstrings.I am sorry, but I am compelled to leave this review. I wore these scrub pants for one 12 hour shift. I am an RN and need to be walking a lot for the job. Out of the bag, these pants felt scratchy. I am aware these are inexpensive pants and not the greatest material. I had no idea what was to come. I get to work and things are fine for the first few hours. I start to notice my thighs are irritated. I knew it was the pants, but chose to just suck it up. Well, 8 hours into my 12 hour shift, I'm miserable. My skin is on fire. I went to the supply room to grab gauze to wrap around my thighs. Once I'm in the bathroom to put the gauze on, I look at my skin. My inner thighs were bright red and covered in raised splotches. This isn't ok. I wrapped up the areas which helped me get through the rest of my night.I understand that this was just my personal experience. I am sure most people won't have the same kind of reaction."
4638,3,"Nice fit- sleeves are a good length, not too long where it gets in the way- neckline was high enough to cover any cleavage, but not so high to the point I felt like I was chokingPoor fabric- fabric was not soft and did not stretch well making it hard to pull my sleeves up when neededI ordered 3 shirts to try out. I wore one today to see if it would get better with wear but it didn't. I haven't tried washing yet so I hope it doesn't shrink or change its shape. I will be returning the 2 I haven't worn."
4639,1,"I just received this shirt. I ordered the Neon Orange in a size Large, based on the Sivvan size chart in the product pictures. It looks like a nice, quality shirt. However, I will have to return it because it is not the size that a Large should be. According to the size chart, the Chest/Bust measurement on the Large should be 40-43. This measurement on the shirt I received is 37 (18 1/2 from armpit to armpit). Hopefully this review will help others who are considering buying this item!"
4640,3,"I ordered a size up from what I normally wear based on the size chart on the product page. These shirts are tight across the bust and restrictive around the underarms and across the back. Further, the sleeves are about 2 inches too short. I picked up a large, and I'm thinking an XL would have been better.Overall, the material is thin; enough to keep a draft off, but not enough to stay warm. There is nothing spectacular about it, either. The cloth is not particularly soft, but it's not super itchy, either. Overall, it's a light long-sleeve shirt that's a bit too short and too small to size."
4641,3,"I am 5'7"" with big boobs. I like my under scrub shirts to be snug fitting, but not tight. The material is fine, not great. It wasn't as stretchy as I like but it was not see through at all. You get what you pay for. I always have a hard time finding a long sleeve undershirt that fits me well. This one did not. Shrunk tremendously after being washed and dried according to directions. It became a 3/4 sleeve shirt and too short in the torso. Just add it to the stack of shirts that I'll only wear if I'm desperate. I almost always need a small for the snug fit but probably need a large for sleeve and torso length. If you're a petite person, this might be a decent and cheap option. If you're slightly taller than average, no go."
4642,2,"I bought these to use as a base layer for hunting, which they are ok for... I guess. The sleeves are too short, the shirt is baggy in all the wrong ways, and I’d only ever wear it if I had a hoodie on over it. It’s not a stand alone shirt for me. I felt very frumpy in it and felt like I had to keep tugging on the sleeves and neckline to get it to sit right. On its own, it’s a very uncomfortable shirt.I kept the shirt, but I won’t be ordering these again. They’ll work under some of my hunting gear, but that’s about it."
4643,3,"I bought 2 pairs as all my scrubs but one pair have gotten too warn to wear and the last pair got stained in the washing machine...I gambled on the extensive amount of positive reviews claiming these were relatively true to size and made well and comfortable. I am sorry to report that none of this is true. The first pair I opened arrived damaged, hole in the seam of the hip of the pants that appears was never sewn closed. Both pairs are stiff and scratchy and both pairs have no room for my chest (yes I am large chested but please do not try to tell me that no one else wearing scrubs has an abundance in their bra)."
4644,2,"Wow, these are small. And they're unisex??? I bought size large expecting them to literally swim on me which is what I wanted but they're too small. I read the reviews and guessed a larger size for myself but apparently that didn't work well for me. Way too tight in the bust so I can barely move my arms and it makes the 4 pockets not handy at all. The pants are too snug in the thighs, again I can barely move. I can't even send them back yet (as I need them badly, or heck I'll just have to find something else in the meantime until these are exchanged) I'm basically screwed. Btw ladies if you have a larger bustlune order a size up. I don't even know if these will shrink which would make them literally impossible to wear. So not what I expected, unfortunately."
4645,1,"I purchased 3 pairs, 2 different colors for my new job and change of uniform while I sold my other 32 pair of various scrubs..The 2 navy blue sets I have shown pile and are fading quickly with every wash, the black set are terrible with pile all over them....I wash my scrubs separately from everything else so I know it isn't the way I'm laundering them. I wont purchase again, inexpensive scrubs for sure but you get what you pay for with these. I've found a better brand that is just as inexpensive and are awesome....Don’t waste your money, pay a few dollars more so you don't have to replace after a few wears."
4646,3,"Color appeared as advertised. No holes. A few stray threads here and there. For reference-I am 5'5"" and 110lbs. I ordered size XS. I spent a long time combing through the reviews before I decided to just go for it. For those of you who are my size or smaller, you know how difficult it is to find scrubs that fit properly. Buying scrubs online for me is like buying a lottery ticket. And I knew ordering these scrubs was straight up gambling. After reading so many mixed reviews, I decided to purchase two pairs and see for myself. If they fit, great. If they didn't, at least I could write an honest review for the XS size. The pants definitely run long, but they're not completely unreasonable. I found that if I rolled the waist up once, they weren't terrible. In fact, I will probably end up wearing the pants to work. The reason I have rated one star is for the top alone. These are in no way, shape, or form, extra small sized. Everything about the top felt like a large. I consider myself to have relatively average proportions for my height and weight. The length of the top could cause it to classify as a mini dress. The width was very potato sack-like. I'm pretty sure they held the measuring tape upside down. I didn't expect Med Couture or Grey's Anatomy quality scrubs by any means. But for the love of God, whoever signed off on these measurements to be advertised as extra small needs to be fired."
4647,3,"I have ordered this gray set twice, plus a red one. The first order was a large and the pants fit great but the top was to tight across my hips. I hate returning things so I thought Id try and pass the too small set on to a coworker and I ordered just the gray one but this time in an XL. It is obvious that an X was written in next to the L on the clothing tag to make it look like a size XL. Needless to say I couldn't get this even down over my hips and even though the pants say XL, they are the same size as the L. The only thing good I can say about these sets is I like the color of the dark gray set. I read all the reviews and did not see too many with major problems pertaining to sizing so I'm super disappointed in this waste of money. By the way, I normally wear a large in all my other scrubs."
4648,3,Opened out of the box and the first thing I noticed was what appeared to be animal or pet hair in the shoe. Upon further inspection I found the upper was missing glue in a critical area and the rivers were not properly installed. From the looks of it either Dansko has a serious QC/QA problem or I was sent a used pair of shoes and sold as new. Not to mention they were right all around. I’m not pleased!I’ve worn Dansko’s for years and these are by far the worst shoes I’ve received.
4649,3,"I’m on my feet for 10-11hrs of my typical 13hr shift. I have worn these shoes for 2 shifts now.Pro: provide the ability to slip on and off easily to massage and/or exercise your feet throughout your work day, are aesthetically nice, fairly lightweight, comes in an array of colors.Cons: the soles are so hard it feels like I have a rug burn under my feet after wearing them for 2 days now, does not provide the feeling of full support like sneakers do, feels more like slippers than nursing work shoes, I do not feel it provides adequate support and security to run in if an emergency situation arouse, and the glue work is horrible."
4650,3,"Cheaply made. Almost seemed to be made of pleather, like a Payless pleather shoe where the brown scrapes off like cardboard. They scratched up easily and got divots. Wore them gently 3 times. Worse Dansko shoes I have ever purchased. None of my others were like this. They must be making these somewhere else or trying to get away with charging outrageous amounts for low quality product. Very uncomfortable as well. Made my feet, knees, hips, and back hurt. None of the others have done that. Almost like these weren't real Dansko's. That's how bad they were. Imposters? Knock offs?"
4651,2,"DISAPPOINTED!!! What happened to the quality product that Dansko used to produce? These shoes are absolutely horrible! Within 2 weeks they broke down and caused pain in my feet and legs to the point that they are no longer wearable. I will no longer ever shop for any Dansko product as they have clearly stopped making quality products. The cost alone of these shoes should ensure a quality product, but this is not so. If I could have given these shoes a minus score, I absolutely would have! Dansko, you have definitely lost a customer in me. Very disappointed!"
4652,3,"My nurse friends have nothing but great things to say about Danskos, so I decided to buy my first pair because I'm on my feet all day long working in the OR. I need both comfort and height. Well, it did give me height, but not comfort. Both of my feet hurt so badly that I could barely walk at the end of the day. I've never been in such foot pain! I was told by many that it takes about 1-2 weeks to break them in. I didn't wear them the next day because my feet were just in a great amount of pain, but I wore them the day after. Overall, the pain wasn't nearly as bad then, but my toes became stiff and painful. It's been 2 weeks since the last time I wore them and the toes on my left foot are still as stiff and painful. Do I need to break or dislocate something before I finally feel the comfort that everyone's been talking about. Heck no! I don't understand the hype about Danskos at all!"
4653,3,"I am 5'4"" and weigh 108 pounds, and somehow have a muffin top in these pants. The elastic waistband is too tight on my 25 inch waist (size XS) but the legs are at least 4 in too wide on my hips and thighs. There is no definition in the butt at all. So they are simultaneously too big and too small. The regular length is way too long even for my average height frame and the petites are too short. I have no idea why anybody would like these pants."
4654,3,"Got these for a clinical exam. They fit wonderful and are super comfy and professional looking. HOWEVER one leg was cut longer than the other. I exchanged and the same thing with the exchange! By an entire inch on both. I even checked to make sure one of my legs wasn’t longer than the other lolAlso the stitching is poorly done and looks like it won’t last long.If that doesn’t bother you, then these are great!"
4655,3,"Normally I LOVE Grey's anatomy scrubs! They are comfortable, durable & the fit well so your scrubs don't snag on anything. I have been buying them for years & have been willing to spend more for each top & pair of pants than other scrubs as long as they last & I can get through a 13 hour shift as comfortably as possible. These ""spark"" colored pants fell short, unfortunately. They are completely see through (you could see my underwear perfectly). This isn't actually a greys episode & we will actually be seen by patients and clients so it's totally impractical & inappropriate. The color looks solid in the photos so they should have a disclaimer that certain shades can be transparent. Now I have to return & reorder only dark colors. I really wanted to order taffy or Cecil blue but now I'll just assume any light color will not be solid. Keep making awesome colors, but make them practical for people who actually work in public for a living!"
4656,1,"Wow these are terribly short. They are complete high water pants and don’t come down enough to your shoes!! I wear XS in all scrub pants, but this brand makes the extra small extra short! I’m 5’5” so I’m of average height... I had to buy a size small just to get the length right. However, the small are ridiculously baggy! And the weird slit at the bottom of the pant legs doesn’t do anything but make them look super weird! I wear a size 5 in jeans, regular length. I’m 120 lbs, if that helps. Also: the pockets are so dysfunctionally high up on the pants that they’re hard to use! The only positive is the soft material: it feels really nice. For the brand, price, and the hype, though: these are terrible! I would not recommend. Two stars are literally just for the cozy material only, not the fit or function."
4657,3,They are supposed to be straight leg but have a little flare to them and hang too long compared to my store bought GAs. I think the person who sewed them was drunk. The left cargo pocket was sewn shut. There was only one bead on one draw string and no bead for the other. The zippered pocket is ridiculous. It's too small to fit anything in. Its vertical so anything you put in falls out before you get it zipped. For me I felt like they were made for a left handed person because I had no place to put my cell phone because I had to cross my body to put it in my Left cargo pocket.
4658,2,"It purchased this pair of scrubs thinking ""these are Dickies, should be an awesome product"" when they came in they fit as expected and were super comfortable but two hours into the shift the rear end ripped and not at a seam about and inch in from the rear pocket all the up to the belt loop down to the top of the thigh., Thank goodness I keep a spare set of scrubs in my locker. Horrible, disappointing product , when I looked at the ripped area, it wasn't stressed. or on a seam. Returned them and wouldn't buy another."
4659,1,"I wanted to love these pants. I have an old pair of Dickies and wanted to try these. They fit OK and look fine, although a bit short. Then I washed them, following the instructions. They looked old and unrecognizable after the first wash. The 2nd photo shows the pants next to another pair of old black pants which hardly has any lint on them. These are supposed to be utility pants. I shouldn't have to use a lint roller every time I wash them! Plus, if you tie a simple knot with the belt string, it's nearly impossible to undo it as the knot fits into the groove. These are too high maintenance to recommended."
4660,3,"The sizing is off for these pants. I am 5' 4"" and weigh 177 lbs. I ordered the large but they are way too big and baggy. I'm not sure if the mediums would fit correctly either so I'm returning these pants. I usually wear mediums in scrub sizes. The pants were also very long and the bottoms flared out so much, I was worried I'd trip going up stairs. I tried wearing these around the house, I often wear sweatpants around, but these were too uncomfortable, I had to take them off. The seaming in the leg rubs as you walk and the material is not very soft. They kept falling down as I walked. Very disappointed since most of the other reviews were good."
4661,3,"These scrubs are the most low-rise pair I have ever owned. Scrubs are supposed to be functional clothing, meant for working and moving around in. These scrubs rested just above my butt crack and dared me to move in them. If I bent my upper body more the 20 degrees, my butt was making an appearance. Working in the hospital at a respectable job is just not the time or place to display a butt crack. I know they say they are ""junior fit"", but Dickies took it a little far. I returned them promptly for a more suitable style of Wonder Wink scrubs.Had these fit better, I think I would have liked them. There are a number of pockets and I felt like I was wearing pants that doubled as a utility belt. I swear there was a loop to hang my (non-existent) hammer. I don't know what else it could be for, but I liked it. I liked the excess of pockets and storage. Nurses are basically like Batman in regard to all of the tools and supplies they keep in their pockets during a work day. If these were made to move in, I think they would have fit the bill."
4662,3,I'm 5 ft 2 and weight about 132 pounds. I bought the small based on the charted waist size but I could have gone to XS. I bought the regular length because I prefer to take in the ends myself.What I don't like about these pants is how WIDE the legs are! I look like I'm ready to rap when I put them on. It's really odd.I have a sewing machine so I was able to take off about two inches of the fabric along the inseam and now it looks more like normal pants.I like the stitching details. The fabric is a bit thinner than I expected but comfortable.
4663,1,"I have two pairs of these in different colors I ordered from uniform sales. I love the way they fit and don't wrinkle. Against my better judgment, I ordered online. I went for the petite because the Large regular size was a little big and a little long (I'm 5'3""), assuming the petite would be a little smaller (although it shouldn't be, as the definition of petite is 5'3"" and shorter, not smaller all around). The Large Petite pants were approximately 1-2 cm shorter, but were a FULL size or even size and a half smaller! Why is it that companies assume that shorter also means smaller? I'm keeping them it's too much of a pain to return them, and they are wearable, just not comfortably. Just beware the sizing."
4664,3,"I've ordered these scrubs in the past and loved them. I've had my previous pairs for 4+ years and they've held up great. I recently ordered again and was very disappointment that they've changed the design. The waistband used to be a super comfortable stretchy band. The material in the waist appears to be the same but they have added a strip of material inside that is NOT STRETCHY AT ALL. As a result they are not quite as comfortable. They barely stretch enough for me to pull them over my hips, once on my waist they are OK. I really loved the product before and wish they would not have changed it. The strip of material is sewed in with a tight double stitch otherwise I would attempt to remove it. I didn't realize this until after washed, otherwise I probably would have sent them back. They fit true to size, I'm 5'4"" and 120 pounds and wear a small top and small bottom."
4665,1,"These are very comfy scrub pants, but I'm not overly impressed by the pockets and the length is a problem for me. I ordered a sz XS petite, as that is what I wear for pretty much every brand of scrub pants - but I have to be cautious because not all petites are ""truly"" petites, or at least not short enough for me. I'm 4'10"" 114 lbs and muscular, but I'm pretty leggy proportionally. I marked these under ""fit as expected"" since otherwise, the sizing is good. These pants are just slightly too long, and I think it's because of how flared they are at the bottom. I thought that because the inseam length is the same as other petite scrub pants that have fit me will, these would be fine, but the bell-bottom like thing these pants have going on at the bottom seems to be the issue. Even with these pants pulled up as high as they go (thank god my scrub tops are a bit long for me, because these pants make my crotch look super weird and camel-toe ish) the bottoms of these pants are trailing the ground with my sneakers on. Very annoying, I will have to get them hemmed now. I was hoping for a little more out of these pants, they aren't exactly the fancy expensive ones but they are more $$ than say Cherokee's iFlex line (which I will be sticking with from now on!) and now I have to spend more money finding someone to hem them. Also, the ONE mid-thigh pocket it has is kind of short. On one hand, I like that my pens wont get lost and i wont have to go digging for things, but there should really be more than one. the upper front pockets are not roomy enough to be useful...they are fine length and with wise, but unless you buy a size that would be rather loose on your thighs and butt, you're not going to fit anything useful in there. Same goes for the butt pockets...they're rather small and I'm not really sure what I would bother to put in there. Also would like to say that these are perhaps a little low rise for my taste. Like I said, I have a really short torso...so many pants that aren't mid-rise are going to be mid-rise on me. These are not. If my scrub shirts weren't so long on me, I'd absolutely be returning these because they do not pass a squat test on me."
4666,3,"I lost weight and needed to go down 1 size in pants. When I received the pants they were extremely small in the waist and length. I thought it was weird that one size up is falling off my waist and one size down is skin tight. I decided to go to a local store that sells the same scrubs and theirs fit me perfectly, confirming my suspicions that my pants were defective/mislabeled."
4667,3,"These have been my favorite scrubs since they came out a few years ago. Love the fit and especially that they don’t fade. However, these look the same at first glance, but my current ones are very big on me, these are snug, and worse, they are very short, and I ordered regular length. I’m only 5’3” and 127lbs. I’ve never had a regular length be too short. Even the black color and material are different than the original. I could never wear the original top and new pants together. All labels say the same, except these are made in Egypt, originals in Vietnam. Whatever they did differently, changed them a lot.Not happy that I had a favorite and now it’s back to trying on twenty new styles. Disappointed. I’m returning."
4668,3,"Sorry, but the last set of wonder wink scrubs are of such a different color. I under stand the dye lot system, but the colors have not been such a huge difference, that they do not even look like the same material. the color was Malibu blue. Im not sure if they came from the same co. or what. I just find design I like for the set and order them. I have ordered lots of the wonder wink scrubs and have not had this happen before."
4669,3,"I have purchased this brand & style from amazon several times. As a matter of fact I purshased a pewter color the month before these. Those were great quality but these fit smaller, feel different and are a total LINT MAGNET! I have passed my return date as I only wear scrubs 3 days a week & not the same ones everyday. I have washed these twice & the lint factor is Aweful! Not to mention they fit tighter than the ones I got the month before in pewter that were the same size & style and fit great! I am very disappointed at the consistency all of a sudden of this product. I need to order a replacement but I’m afraid it will be the same thing. It’s hard enough finding something u like in the bigger sizes in petite length. I am so disappointed. I really need a pair like my last ones. I had to go buy another lint roller for these <U+0001F62B>."
4670,3,"I am 5'2"" 190 lbs. with curvy hourglass, these are NOT my favorite scrub pants. I bought the XL Petite. The fit is that funky dip in butt I hate, the back of the waistband is lower than the front so it constantly gives the feeling that your pants are sliding down. If you have a flat bottom, this may not bother you. The length though is perfect wish they sat at the waist more equally, the pull string at waist is not needed as they have elastic. The legs are very narrow, which would be great if you are shaped that way, I am not and the seam around the leg just accentuates the awkward tightness. These have nice fabric and color, the pockets are nice, I may look at other cuts by this company. The 2 stars is only for the length and fabric."
4671,2,"In the past I have ordered these scrubs and absolutely loved them. I am supremely disappointed with my most recent order. Since I have several pairs of these scrubs, I am familiar with how size runs and fit of this product. The Pewter scrubs I ordered this time are sized as large, but fit more like a medium. They are way too snug compared to other orders. I also ordered an electric purple pair that also fit a little differently. I am unhappy with the pewter scrub pants, due to complete change in fit. It;s almost when they were sewing in tags,they were mistagged. I will hesitate to order these scrub pants in the future."
4672,3,"I was ordering for my office staffs, probably I need to order more than 50 sets. When I browsed this one seemed to be cute and price was so good ;$22 per one set including top and bottom. So I ordered one pair each size , so my staffs can try on and pick the right sizes so I can order 4 pairs per employee. About one week later, I was about to order the rest of order, they doubled the price ! So we called the customer services three times to request to match your own price 1 wk ago, they didn’t want our business."
4673,3,"I really wanted to love these scrubs. They fit great and the material is really nice, but they fall down ALL DAY LONG. The tie at the waist doesn’t help you tighten the waist band at all, so I’m constantly having to pull them up. I don’t usually keep things in the pockets of my scrub pants, but I don’t know how they could stay up at all if you’re weighed down by a lot of stuff. 2 hours into my 12 hour shifts, I always regret putting these on."
4674,3,"I am 5’5” & 180lbs. I was on the fence on what size to order... do I go based off of the size chart or off the reviews. I decided to go with the XL. I loved everything about these pants. They were a great material and very comfortable, but they were just a little too big and I know they won’t shrink. I didn’t want to spend my days constantly pulling my pants up and I know my coworkers at the veterinary clinic will appreciate that they aren’t falling down when restraining animals.I am returning the XL and going to try the larges."
4675,3,The length on these for petite are great. I’m 5’2 and they’re perfect so if you’re 5’2 or maybe even 5’1 these will hit your ankles no doubt. Only issue I have with these (these would be so freaking amazing if not for this) is the drawstring is like half FAKE. like what?? It only pulls together the front half of the waistband and the back isn’t even attached to the drawstring. It’s so bizarre like so these are too loose on top and i don’t think a regular large will fit my thighs. I’m regularly a 16 and I have a smaller waist and larger hips like an hourglass and it just doesn’t fit me very well. I love them but if you have a smaller waist these might be hard to fit since the drawstring is completely worthless.
4676,2,"I am 5'7, an athletic 140 pounds, and purchased these pants in an x-small tall. I wear a size 26 in Joe's jeans, generally a 2-4 in Gap, Banana Republic, j.crew, etc.I have a small waist and quite large legs and have purchased at least 5 pairs of HeartSoul scrub pants in the past, that I have loved, always an x-small tall. I do not generally order on line but I thought since I had repurchased many times from this company I knew what I was getting myself into.Somehow the waist on these pants is still too large, significantly so; I believe that is mainly due to the bizarre waist band. In addition, there is not enough tautness/hold to properly tuck in a top, which I find irritating and the strings do not tighten the waist band at all. They just seem to be there to come untied and bother me. The thighs are a liiiiiitle tight but not uncomfortably so, I have felt like this brand usually stretches out by the end of the shift which is why in spite of my weight, my standard size is an x-small. I think it is definitely noticeable around my bum but again I think that is a me problem, not an everyone problem. Overall I would say that somehow these pants fit both too small and too large. Which is annoying.I thought potentially the pants were a little too long, but looking at the provided pictures, I think mine actually fit pretty similarly. I think the model is a bit slimmer than me (obviously) and so they lay a little nicer on her.The fabric of these pants is standard for the Heart Soul line, they are sort-of ""swishy"" which I enjoy because I feel like it wicks better and doesn't show sweat or spills of any sort easily. I work in the ER so we have our fair share of spills. Also the fabric doesn't attract lint/hair/dust like the usual cotton scrubs do and because I wear black scrubs most of the time I appreciate that.Overall I have a lot of mixed emotions about these pants. The style is cute, the fit is strange, fabric is great, waistband is...kindof awful?I would return or exchange them for potentially a small regular length, but my neighbor stole this package and wouldn't give me my pants until I showed her I had proof she nabbed it off my doorstep. Unfortunately she didn't open the package in a manner that made the envelope reusable.I'm going to wear for a shift and update review accordingly, with photos."
4677,1,So I brought these pants looking for a jogger style scrub for work. I ordered a pair of sm petite first since I am in between sm and med. For the small it fit me snug and little short for the leg I am 5'1 and the waist was ok. But I went ahead and ordered a med since I felt they would shrink. The med petite was fine the material is comfortable but the waist was big. The drawstring is just for show they do not tighten which sucks. Also the pant is a little short and for me and I use petite on almost everything. These pants wouldn't have been bad if the waist actually tightened and for the price they are kind of expensive so save your money.
4678,3,"I dinged off two more stars after I received my smaller size. I started with medium petite and it was too large. I returned them, ordered another pair in small petite and they're too small. I still love the design but the range between the two sizes is too extreme. :( Sad. I'll keep them, because I'm at the high end of my weight range right now and they'll probably work when I'm at the low end.I LOVE this design! I dinged off a star because of the sizing, but that having been done, the pants are exactly what I wanted. I am 5'3"", 132 lbs, 30"" waist, 38"" hips. I ordered the medium petite and it's way too big. (and I prefer my clothes on the loose and baggy side!) Returning them and getting small petite instead."
4679,3,"I am 140lbs and 5'9"" and I used the size chart provided and measured at a medium. I also took into consideration the reviews that said they ran small. I ordered the medium and when I tried them on, they were way too big in the waist, though they fit ""okay"" through the leg. I bought two pairs for work and only wore the one while I am returning the second pair. I was constantly pulling them up and unable to get the drawstring tight enough to keep them on. The length was the only thing that was measured correctly. Very disappointed with the product."
4680,3,Update: the newest pair I bought that was also the longest already has the elastic coming off! I'm thoroughly upset and have contacted the company.I ordered 4 pairs of these pants and different times. They were all the same size - Large petite. However NONE of them are the same length. Apparently different colors change the size. Only 1 out of 4 actually fit height wise and the rest I am going to have to hem. It's frustrating because I ordered those first so thought the rest would be perfect. They are not.
4681,3,"So bummed these didn't work on me! I had a couple classmates with these, and they looked great, so I ordered a pair. I have an athletic body type, so my legs and booty are muscular, but my waist is smaller (5'5, 145). I ordered my usual size M, and the legs and booty fit great, but the elastic waistband was several inches too big, so it didn't even touch my lower back. The ties are underneath the string, so pulling them tight did not fix the lower back gap. I also felt the crotch area was too long for a lower-rise, more modern looking pant."
4682,3,"After reading half of the reviews that said they were too big, and the other half saying they were too small, I just went with my normal size, extra large. For reference, I am 5'4"" and 185 lbs, so not small by any means. Not even just 'large,' by any means. These things are HUGE on me! Not only that, but the inseam is in no way 'petite' length. They may even be too long for a tall girl! They may be comfortable, but I guess I'll never know since I don't want to trip and fall while wearing them. Two stars because the color is pretty."
4683,3,"The Koi Lindsey pant is my go to! I love these scrub pants, BUT these were not the same. They looked like the Lindsey scrub pant I always purchase, but these were slightly different. The tie string was just for looks it didn’t actually go all around the waist so my pants would slide down every time I sat down. Not something you want when you have a busy day at work. You aren’t able to tighten the string to ensure your scrub bottoms are on securely. I never realized how important the tie string was. I am going to return these and I’ll stick to my scrub catalogues."
4684,1,"Just awful!! This company used to put it unsurpassed quality, now it's junk! I bought a pair in blue and white. The white was thin and see through! Koi was bee ever like that in the past! The blue was tight! I couldn't understand it until I looked it up on the description again and noticed it actually said "" SIZES VARY BY COLOR "" Are you serious??? I do not pay over $30 for a pair of scrub pants that is made that poorly! I've worn nothing but this brand for the last 10 years and I will NOT but from this company again. They never used to have these issues. Obviously Koi and Kathy Stevenson care more about profit than the customer. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS BRAND!!!"
4685,3,"I was so disappointed in my order. I have worn ONLY Koi, XS Tall, Lindsey Cargo scrubs my entire career. That I why I had no worries about ordering them online, instead of trying them in the store. I ordered two pair (just different colors) of the same style, same size pants. The blue ones fit, and the black ones were too small. I returned the black ones and ordered a small (instead of the usual extra small) to make up for them being so small. When they came, they were too big! I had already removed the tags too. I'm guessing the first ones were a factory defect, and the second ones were true to size (just not MY size). I'm really bummed about my order, and got stuck with a pair of scrubs I can't wear. :("
4686,3,"I bought two of these: one at full price and one at a discount on Prime Day. I'm returning the ones that I bought for full price because they are not exactly like the ""real"" Koi scrubs. My mother is a nurse and has been buying these scrubs for years and all of hers have the D ring on the side of the leg, not in the front like the Amazon ones do. The knee stitching is also different and sits a little bit higher on the knee than the legit pants. Long story short, I'm going to keep the ones that I bought at a discount because the fabric is still nice and I think they are worth that price with the irregularities. However, I would not pay full price for these so I'm returning the first pair I bought. If I could contact the seller, I would ask for a refund of the difference so that I could keep them, but I can't figure out how to reach them. I'll hold on to the scrubs for a few more days in case they see this review."
4687,3,"I have loved the Koi Lindsey pant for the last 4 years but when I ordered the last 2 times the pant has come looking different than the picture. The pictured pant is what I love and wanted. The new design has moved the D-ring to the front of the pant which is awful, my trauma shears now bang against the front of my leg when I walk. Also, there is now an extra leg pocket on the left side which is nice but again, I'd rather be able to have the D-ring on the side of the leg so I can continue carrying my shears and clamps there."
4688,3,"This shirt is made for a petite person. I don't say that to be mean - it's just as a 5'7"" woman the sleeves are about an inch and a half away from my wrists, and the shirt will not stayed tucked in. It wants to float about an inch above my waistline. If you are built much smaller it may work. But if not, enjoy your odd length sleeve crop top. (uck.)AZ Sales sent me a follow up email asking if I was happy with the shirt. I was honest with them (no!) and even provided photos of how poor the shirt fits compared the same one I had already purchased (in white, two weeks earlier) Leah's responses ranged from ""we'll give you a refund"" to ""we just changed stock, one shirt must be old stock"" to ""I can clearly see these are two different style shirts"" Both shirts are style 144859, and both were ordered from the same amazon listing. I think they are just using any excuse to avoid making good on their promise to refund my money and provide the ""excellent service"" they claim to have. Goodness knows I tried to work with them before leaving this review.Pictures included so you can see the different lengths for yourself. I drug the shirts by the hems to show the white shirt is clearly longer than the black shirt, and the seam between the arm and torso are matched up to show the dramatic difference in sleeve length."
4689,3,"Please note that I did not contact the seller. I ordered a 3XL and it fits like a XL top.While the item itself is a good one; it runs small. I went by the Size Chart provided, and it is nowhere close in the bust and waist measurements. Maybe this was a fluke?Wouldn't be bad to use as a ""winter"" layer but that wasn't my original plan... However, one of my household members washed it before I could try it on. :-( The quality seems to be good, and I really like the ""tagless"" aspect of it.Oh well..."
4690,1,"this product was WAY too small. I have large breasts and when I put this top on, it was very snug all throughout my torso but did not reach down far enough to meet where my pants started! The material felt weird and was scratchy on my skin. The sleeves also were not long enough. I wear a Large standard size tshirt and I ordered an XL just to be safe but it was WAY too small!!!I honestly would have returned this item, except it would have been almost as much money to ship back to the company so I plan on donating it to charity. DO NOT buy this item!!!"
4691,3,"The item was definitely not what I expected, I ordered an xl because I like a little room for my long sleeves under my scrubs, but this item was super tight with no give what so ever.i would say the class runs a size small, especially if you have larger boobs. So I started the return process with this company after they approved my return the return shipping is NOT FREE, which mean now not only was the shirt small and totally not what I expected but now I'm having to pay for shipping too.. Total bummer because I thought I've found the right long sleeve for under my scrubs and for no free shipping on returns well then that's a double whammmy. Definitely going to order elsewhere."
4692,1,Fits like spanks. If you are expecting these sizes to run small they run very small. I ordered one size larger than I normally wear and I feel like I am putting on spanks. They bind and I can't move but I bought them to be an under layer for winter wear. These will end up going to someone else who is a smaller size. Very disappointed even after checking the sizing chart I ordered a 2x and I normally wear a 1x in women's clothing and they still didn't fit. Not worth the time and effort to send back but I certainly don't recommend them. If it says it is a woman's 2x it should fit like it is that size. The material is strong but unforgiving if the size is wrong. I suspect they would wear like iron but getting the correct size should be as listed on the size charts when you order.
4693,1,"This is probably one of the worst-made garments I've ever seen. I know there's a lot of discussion about the multiple manufacturing sites, mine was made in Haiti, if that helps anyone out.I bought a small when I'm usually a medium (after a few washes) in these type of cheaper shirts (Hanes, FTL, etc.) because everyone said they run large. This is only partly true. The shirt was VERY long. I'm 5' 10"" and the small came to my mid thigh. The sleeves were big and billowy around the bicep and super tight around the forearm and cuff. I'm not a huge guy, but a small should NEVER be too big on me. It honestly felt like three different shirts combined, somehow. The material was also pretty rough. I don't think fabric softener would have done anything to make this shirt more comfortable.I like Carhartt as a brand and know that they have some goods at higher price points that will last a lifetime. This shirt, or at least some of them, aren't getting the kind of attention their jackets and pants receive. Stay away or go find it at your local Army Surplus store to make sure you're not wasting your time."
4694,2,"I am very disappointed with this shirt and am returning it without even bothering to try it on.I own this exact shirt in this exact color that I have owned for several years. My older shirt is made of much heavier fabric than the new one I received today.I read a number of other negative reviews here that mention the Haiti manufacturing facility as being the source of the poorly made shirts and low quality fabric. From what I learned today about the Ash color, XL, Carhartt Men's Workwear Midweight Jersey Pocket Long-Sleeve T-Shirt, I have to agree.I purchased two of these shirts. One Ash and one Black. Both are inferior to the Ash colored XL that I currently own. I'll list the facts which confirm to me the poorer quality of the fabric in the new version.My original Ash colored shirt- Made in Honduras | 99% cotton/ 1% polyester | Weighs 424gm/15ozNew Black colored shirt- Made in Guatemala | 100% cotton | Weighs 402gm/14.2oz is slightly larger and was weighed with tags and stickers still attached.New Ash colored shirt- Made in Haiti | 99% cotton/ 1% polyester | Weighs 384gm/13.5oz is slightly larger and was weighed with tags and stickers still attached.The fabric on the Ash/Haiti version was very coarse to the touch and practically see through when held up toward a light across the room and is immediately noticeably, thin.The fabric on the Black/Guatemala version was ok, but not great and I hope it softens up in the wash. It blocked a fair amount of the light when held up but was still noticeably thinner than my older shirt.My Ash/Honduras version is, obviously softer after years of washing, but blocks most of the light when held up and feels thick and substantial.I am returning the Ash/Haiti version because it is such poor quality and had it been my first ever Carhartt shirt I would assume that the brand was over-hyped and made crappy workwear.I will keep the Black/Guatemala version and wear it around for a while before deciding whether or not to keep it or send it back. Regardless, both of these shirts were a big let down and the quality is not what they used to be.Both of the newer shirts ran larger than sized and even with all that additional fabric, as compared to my other shirt, still weighed in at 1-1.5 ounces lighter even including all the cardboard tags and stickers.FYI: After many, many years buying from Amazon, this is the first review I've ever written. That should tell you something about how negatively I view this product; Carhartt Men's Workwear Midweight Jersey Pocket Long-Sleeve T-Shirt."
4695,3,"I bought this shirt (made in Haiti) and one other in a different color. (Blue) made in Mexico. I can't believe how thin the material is in them. Not the carhartt quality I had come to know over the years. I always bought carhartt shirts and products because of how nice and thick the material was. I wanted the same in this long sleeve shirt for warmth. Not the case at all, and way too big. I put this shirt on over another long sleeve shirt with a short sleeve t shirt under that, and it still hung 6 - 8 inches below my waist. Im about 6 ft 190 & these T's are too big. I still may have lived with that , knowing they will likely shrink over time, but it is so cheaply made there is no way im keeping it. I bought a gildan at the same time for $6.40 and I can honestly say the quality of that shirt is at very least as good as these carhartt shirts. Carhartt is charging $20 to $40. I'm guessing its because they are now selling their logo now more then a quality product. I don't leave many comments here on Amazon but I've never felt so disappointed about something. Carhartt seems to be following others like Nike etc, who made a great name for themselves because they made great products, then got greedy and no longer care about the quality only the logo. Sending both shirts back, and going to a department store where i can see and feel the quality of what I'm buying. This is one problem I see with the future of Amazon. Quality will go down because companies (like Carhartt) will bank on the fact that many will not take time to return items or write reviews. Get with it Carhartt or I'm taking my business elsewhere. I added some pictures here. I hung these shirts against a sliding glass window with the sun behind to show how thin they are. As a comparison, I hung a 5 year old carhartt short sleeve shirt (blue) that has been washed and dried dozens and dozens of times. It is still thicker then the brand new shirt that I just received. I also took pics of the white $20 carhartt and the 6.40 competitor shirt. Yes, the carhartt has a pocket. But the material is terrible. Not paying $15 xtra dollars for a pocket. There is also one picture showing how huge it fits."
4696,3,"I usually wear an XL...this runs large and a size Large fits great. I like the look of this shirt...however the material is a ""softer"" tee and I'm not certain it will hold up like my old Carhartt's. The neck started to ""pill"" after a half dozen times of wearing.Bottom line: The quality seems to have dropped off significantly.Updated on 4-2-18: I'm changing my rating to a one star after wearing it and washing it a half-dozen times. The entire shirt has ""pilled"" with the heaviest pilling around the neck. I own a number of Carhartt long sleeve tees and this one is a very big disappointment. A total waste of money...I guess I could change the oil in my car with it..."
4697,3,"I purchased 2 of these in L knowing they fit a little big. 1 in black and 1 in navy. The black one (made in Haiti) fit perfect. It is made from the heavy material and feels awesome. The blue one (made in Honduras) was still too big. The material is thinner. I'll rate the black one a 5 star but why is Carhartt doing this to its customers? I've been a life long Carhartt fan but I'm starting to veer away. When Dickies is starting to compete in quality with a lower cost it's probably time to reassess your product. Put the effort back in to your quality Carhartt and quit riding on the fact you made a good name for yourself. Frustrating. To help other consumers I'm 6' 210 with a normal/athletic build. I'm not all cut up but I'm not flabby either. I like clothes to fit. Not draped over me and not stuck to my body. Hope this helps!

4698,1,"We purchased these Steel Toe Safety Shoes for our son's birthday. We gave them to him on March 1. He began using them on March 4 and by April 19 he returned them with the toes completely worn through on the top and big hole on the bottom where a piece of metal went through. Inside the lining was completely torn. I have photos that I cannot get on this site but will be happy to send by email. We are passed our return date, but this is the first time that we have purchased something from Amazon that is junk and we will keep on giving this product bad reviews. Our money should be returned!!!!"
4699,1,"These shoes hurt my feet, the tips of them curve in crushing my toes together. I normally wear a size 10 and the shoe it self is long enough just not wide enough at the toes.Edit: A few months after wearing them they started falling apart in the inside and getting holes around the shoe. Holes by the big toe, pinky toes, and holes in the back. They are also putting holes in all my socks.I don't recommend these shoes to anyone."
4700,1,"My husband bought these for his job in a factory making steel tubing. When he got them mid-January, he really liked the feel and look to them. They were indeed slip resistant. But 6 weeks later the bottom soles had worn down so fast that there were several spots where the sole was completely gone. So what we thought was going to be a great purchase turned into some of the worst money we’ve ever spent. Very disappointed."
4701,1,I'm an administrative employee in a Steel Fabrication shop. The majority of my time is spent in the office but I do have to go out in the shop regularly which requires me to wear steel toe shoes. I decided to give these a try. The fit well and were very comfortable throughout the workday. My biggest issue is the exterior soles wore out in about four months. And that's with walking less than 6000 steps per day. I have to say I'm rather disappointed. I was hoping they would last at least 6-8 months. I can't recommend these.
4702,3,"I ordered this and it took about 6 weeks to get here. I've had these since January, and there is already a hole in the side where the shoe structure fell off into my shoe. I felt like my sock had just rolled down so I fixed it and it was still there so I took my shoe off and there was a piece of shoe on the sole of my shoe. I got it out and there was a hole in the side of it. So I spent money for a shoe to last 5 months. Might as well bought a name brand shoe."
4703,3,"Here's the thing: I LOVE these boots. I'm in Europe for the semester and wear these everywhere: climbing rock formations, wandering cobblestone streets, through mud and puddles and they've been great. EXCEPT I only bought them less than six months ago and they've only been consistently worn for the last two and a half and they're falling apart. The zipper on one broke off and the material is coming apart from the sole on the other. I was hoping for another couple months out of these until I finish my semester abroad so am not sure what to do now."
4704,1,"The first pair I got had a loose eyelet, and the company was awesome and exchanged them without any hassle and they were very on top of staying in communication with me. I can't say enough of the seller, they've been great. However, I purchased these boots to wear at work and with daily use, the fell apart very quickly. Within a month one of the soles fell completely off. I expect more for what I paid when I could have gone to Big 5 and gotten a pair that takes the same amount of abuse for the same amount of money. They're adorable, and they fit well, but don't purchase these if you're planning on wearing them consistently."
4705,1,"I purchased these boots last year when my husband told me he was bringing home a motorcycle and I was so excited to get them! I received them and they looked and felt great when I tried them on! The small zippers did not open smoothly so I never really messed with them because I didn't have a use for the little pockets the couple times I did wear them. Long story short: the motorcycle my husband brought home needed work and sat for almost a year in our garage while my boots sat for just as long in my closet without being worn! This Spring he got the bike working and after not even 5 rides, I went to put the boots on and the main zipper COMPLETELY BROKE. I sent in pictures to the company and explained the situation and even contacted amazon with no resolve, which is such a bummer. These boots are CHEAPLY made if the zipper busts off after just a few uses. I would not recommend this product."
4706,1,"These were great the first 2 months of LIGHT use, but they have no durability. I recently took a 3 week trip abroad and they could not stand up to the test. The side pocket zipper on one of the shoes broke, which looks odd and rendered it useless, the whole point of these shoes was to have a place to store money while I was traveling. And they are MOST DEFINITELY NOT water tight. You step into one puddle and your socks are soaked. The sole of the shoe right under the ball of my foot split open, so now ALL water gets into the sole. Do NOT buy these shoes, they are a waste of money. So after 4 months these are completely useless. See photos attached."
4707,3,"I decided to buy these after reading all the reviews claiming this was a great boot. I should not have and I am returning the boots. The boot is very light (not even as heavy as my tennis shoes), where the shoe and sole come together is not very well put together (pieces of material are sticking out), the laces are shiny and look like they will break easy. When I put them on (I ordered up a size because they are boots, if I hadn't they still would not have fit) they were just a bit too big, I needed a half size. There was no cushion, at all. No arch support, it almost seemed like it actually sloped down in that area. The calf was snug, I am not sure it would have worked had I tucked my pants into them (I am plus size). The worst part of the boot was the ankle. It was huge and puffed out when I stood up. I am so disappointed in the boot and the reviews. I had trouble with the pouch zipper."
4708,1,"I wore these shoes for about 6 months and I most often wear them at the front desk... where I stand in place. I serve part time maybe 2 simple shifts a week. The seems on these shoes are all coming undone already. Also, disappointing that they don't sell half sizes because these were wayyyy too large. I usually get the Tredsafe from Walmart and they work great! They are also the same price. I have already returned to Walmart to pick up a new pair of Tredsafe shoes. This is the last time i will stray from my Walmart Tredsafes. Thanks for the disappointment, Sketchers. If you'd like to give a refund, I can send you back these garbage shoes so you can see how horribly they held up."
4709,1,"I ordered these shoes for work. The shoes were ranked as the top shoe for nurses and was excited to try them out. When them came I was a little surprised how they were made (all one piece, no moveable tongue). They fit well but were a little wider than I expected. I have now had them since the beginning of January and at the end of March while lacing them up they broke. The eyelet completely broke which is supposed to be made of shoe fabric as well. I have only worn these for work and nothing else. I also always untie them instead of sliding them off. I was not expecting the cost of the shoe to end up being poorly made. So buyers.....beware."
4710,3,Unlike other reviews I got my normal size 7 and I could’ve gone with a 6.5 bc my foot slides around in the shoe. They are falling apart after 5 weeks of clinical use. Any time I have to be on my feet my feet are aching with these shoes. I transported patients all over the hospital yesterday for 6 hours straight and these shoes did not help at all. My legs and feet still hurt next day. I’m an X Ray student so there’s not a whole lot of walking or standing at all times unless I’m at a certain hospital but it takes no time for these shoes to start hurting my feet. Spent too much money on these for that. Shame.
4711,3,"I've never had a problem w Skechers before, I often buy them for work. They're normally spot on w their sizes, and their slip-resistant line has been reliable and efficient in my experience. This version is horrible. I ordered a half size up, as I always do, because i have very wide feet. I couldn't even get the shoe on, it was so narrow and small. The material is also unyielding, so it doesnt flex or stretch. The sidewalls of the shoe were also odd, very short. It barely covered my foot- i could put two fingers width between the bottom of my ankle and the top of the sidewall. This is a VERY small shoe."
4712,1,"I ordered these shoes for work. The shoes were ranked as the top shoe for nurses and was excited to try them out.

4713,3,"Fit is fine. Material feels hella cheap but I know from experience it gets softer after a few washes. Came missing a snap button which is annoying, not annoying enough to send it back though. I like the color and price, you get what you pay for. The button thing sucks though. At least give me the corrrect buttons..."
4714,3,This fits pretty well around the torso but the arm length is really short. It's difficult to work when you can't stop focusing on how uncomfortable you are.Pulling up the sleeves would alleviate the tight feeling and restricted motion but that defeats the purpose of a scrub jacket.The material isn't great but it was about what I was expecting for the price.
4715,3,"I weigh 130 lbs and 5'6.5 inches tall. After reading the reviews some suggest to get a size smaller so I got an Xtra small ( I usually fit in a medium). The Xtra small was huge on me could've pass for some large top. I washed it thinking that probably it would shrink (not) so I wasted my $14 because now it's in the pile of clothes that does not fit I took the tags off so I'm not able to return it. The xxs would've been perfect.My advice is to get 2 sizes smaller. The quality is good, I gave three stars because an Xtra small shouldn't be so HUGE."
4716,3,"First, when ordering an XL I never thought that meant huge body and super short arms. I have long arms, big breasts, and large shoulders and this jacket is made with extremely short arms. The arms might as well be three-quarter sleeves with as short as they are. I unfortunately had already laundered both jackets by the time I noticed this flaw and I am now stuck with two ridiculous looking warm up jackets that I cannot wear."
4717,3,"It showed up with two missing buttons (most disappointing of all) and was massive. I'm 5'4 and 164 pounds and ordered the xl, I probably should have gotten a small or a medium. I won't be buying from this company anymore and told all of my dental friends to stay away. If I had time to return it and get my money back I would but obviously anyone buying scrubs has absolutely ZERO time to go out of the way especially when it should have been right in the first place."
4718,3,"It's ok, it's not a common camo so people look you twice, XL don't fit my waist, this XXL do but are a little bit loose on legs so if you use them low on your waist they seems to be a little biggerI Must say that after the first wash (standar cold water) the red parts paint the white parts so now it's like a pink Camo.I can't use it again anymore. too bad."
4719,2,"I actually ordered 2 pair , one in navy camo blue and one in grey. The navy camo blue was as described and fit accordingly . so I figured all is good , off to the laundry with both pair .. well the camo blues still fit as described , but I cant even button the top button of the grey ones . I checked the labels again , yep , same size , same cotton poly blend .....ok , so now I put them togeather and sure enough the grey ones are smaller in the waist by about 2 inches .. I hate doing returns , so the grey ones are destined for salvation army .. I really like the camo blue , they are pretty darn nice , but I am very hesitant to order again , will have to find another source , beware of the sizing , Rothco need to check up on quality control ..for the price I expect better , and I doubt these are used by the military , I didnt see any mil spec #."
4720,1,"They fit as expected and that's where the positive aspects of this purchase and its use come to an end.After two washes, they look 10 years old. With products of this caliber, it's no wonder Rothco is so widely known as a Tactical Turd Merchant. The stitching and material are beyond bad. There's unacceptable and then there's Rothco. They've found new ways to disappoint consumers. While a $30 pair of pants is hardly a wardrobe investment, they should last longer than a month. After a few trips to the range and a few hours on the mat, these look like the south end of a north bound horse. Save your money and buy something from a decent manufacturer. Gave one star because amazon requires it. Would have given zero. These pants suck. Big time."
4721,3,"These pants run small and they’re made in China. They aren’t rip stop material or anywhere close to authentic bdu’s. I would look at a local army surplus store if you want authentic uniform bottoms that will preform as needed for a service uniform pant. These pants don’t fit the description of Rothco bdu’s, they seem like knock offs or imitations."
4722,3,"I ordered a LARGE, I received a LARGE-LONG. The Large -Long is not even an option on the order page. There is a big difference between Large and Large-Long. I'll end up keeping them as I am tired of returning them. The long's have an inseam of ""32 ½"" - 35 ½"", the Large have a inseam of ""29 ½ - 32 ½"". My original order would have fit nicely. I will wash them and hope they shrink a little, then use the ties on the bottom to keep them from dragging on the ground. You need to fix the Sizing options and only ship what the customer orders.I give it ONE Star, because of Quality Control in Orders and OptionsOtherwise, I like the pants."
4723,2,"This will be my last Columbia pants purchase. I bought this pant model many years ago and still wear those pants for everyday. The material wears like iron. I've put those pants through every outdoor experience imaginable. Unfortunately, the current fabric Columbia is using is absolutely the worst active wear material I've ever worn. I wash all my clothes according to directions and these pants pilled after the first washing. The exterior crotch material looks like cheap underwear. Very disappointed."
4724,2,I own a pair of these pants in a different color. I love them and they fit perfectly. These were cut completely different the legs were loose in the waist was way too tight. I ordered another pair from a different source. The legs fit but again the waist was even smaller. I love Columbia gear but seems they should have better quality control with their sizing . I would like to order another pair but I don't think I want to take a chance. Ip'm tired of shipping things back.
4725,3,"I would have preferred for these to be a bit shorter. For some reason, the listing does not allow you to choose a length, so you get the average, which is about an inch longer than a normal ""average"". I took the review down to two stars due to the fact that these pants don't have any normal pockets, just one small zippered one on the left side which, as a right handed person, is very hard to get into."
4726,3,"I'm 5'9, 145 lbs, and wear a size 6 or 8 in pants. I ordered these in size 8 regular. These may just rank up there as the most unflattering pants I've ever tried on. The lines of the pants make my hips and thighs look huge, when they typically don't. The inseam was so short that I could have waded through a flood without any risk of wet pants. The pants were very thin with a windbreaker feel and a loud sound when the material moved. Yikes. Sent back immediately. Definitely not for me."
4727,3,"I ordered 2 sizes up from my normal Columbia size (I’m usually a 20 across the board, and ordered these in a 24). I, #1, was shimmying the zipper up on these and looked like a stuffed sausage. Then, the zipper around the thought made it look like my legs were being cut in half! I don’t know where Columbia went wrong with these pants (again, I can only comment on the plus sizes), but I’m extremely disappointed that these pants didn’t work out."
4728,1,"This wallet seemed like a really good product but it isn't. I received it 3 days ago and the fabric is already cracking and ripping, the money clip makes it impossible for the cards to smoothly slide in and out of the pockets, and not to mention that it has begun to bend my cards on the opposite slots. The material on the inside parts of the card holders has stripped off and stuck to my cards. I would not recommend this product to other buyers. If you're looking for wallets with money clips, find ones that have the attachment on the outside and not the inside of the wallet."
4729,3,"The wallet works OK, but I'm quite underwhelmed with it. It's at least 50% bigger than it needs to be for cards to fit into the slots. The material feels REALLY cheap. And the money clip is too loose to properly hold bills in place. If I hadn't destroyed the packaging that it came in while trying to open it, I probably would have returned it. Really wish I would have purchased the same one I recently lost (Alpine Swiss). That one is twice as good for half the price (if only the magnet was slightly stronger on it)."
4730,3,"The money clip is too tight. I couldn’t fit more than a few billsIf you are going for a money clip then why make it as big as a wallet? Neither there nor here.Also, would have really liked a transparent sleeve for the idUpdate:I really think this was a thoughtless design. With just a few bills added to the clip, I can no longer put credit cards in the sleeves. If I manage to shimmy it in, it is a struggle to get it back out."
4731,3,"I will be returning, the wallet is slim which is the point but that clip is not functional, it is so narrow and tight, it won’t open and close like other wallets with clip and it has barely room... just to put 3 or 4 bills... My husband has a clip wallet (Fossil) and the clip holds tickets, bills, papers...this is a wallet to carry the very minimum, if you put many credit cards the clip won’t hold anything."
4732,3,"I ordered the black wallet first. It looked nice but had a defect with the stitching and a piece a leather already worn/peeled off upon opening. Decided to order another to see if I just received a random defective unit.The second wallet sent to me was CLEARLY USED even though I bought a new wallet. The second wallet was not packaged nearly as nice as the first one. Upon further inspection of the wallet, the pockets were clearly stretched out from some previous use as well as the money clip being pulled out making it so it could barely hold money before it slid out."
4733,3,I bought this in May and did not get chance to use until now. Within a week use it started loosing the thread stitches. I read lot of good reviews and bout. But ver disappointed with quality that listed only a week. I hope others had good experience and mine may be defective and I never checked until now when it started loosing stitches day by day.
4734,3,This is the first review I have written on Amazon and felt compelled due to the shorty quality of this item. Maybe someone else can avoid the same trouble.The stiches literally started coming undone the second week I had this. I couldn’t be bothered with exchanging and now a couple of months later the whole side has completely deteriorated to the point that my credit cards fall out.
4735,3,"Love the pink color.,That's about all. Slots measure 2 3/8 inch. My Travelon which I have used for seven years, has slots measuring 2 1/2 inches. That little amount of room makes all the difference. If you use more than three or four cards you won't be happy with this. If you try to use it with cash in the open area, you won't be happy with it. The stiches pull and wallet gets a little bent out of shape. With this cheap production, trying to save costs for such a tiny bit of leather, I wonder if it is truly Rfid secure. I wish Amazon would look at the quality of what they are selling. If you have 40 sellers with the same merchandise, sell the good ones!!! Arrives in a box and a little bag for gift giving I guess. Will not be sending this to my family as a gift. It's just not easy enough to use.."
4736,3,"I saw this wallet online yesterday and thought it would be great for my trip that I am leaving on tomorrow. I paid for the overnight delivery fee and received what I consider to be a very subpar wallet.First it took me about 5 minutes of wiggling to get my license in the front pocket and once in it wouldn't come out...Next I started loading up my credit cards, the first two pockets took them with only minor argument but the third (top most) wouldn't take a card at all, again just too tight.When I started putting in 5 bills of cash it again put up a fight. When I looked inside I saw that this wallet is held together by a lot of glue and what I consider to be sub-par materials.From the outside this looks like a well constructed wallet but once you start trying to use it you begin to see its true worth... I will be seeking a full refund."
4737,3,"The size and look of the wallet is great, but if you want o be able to grab your cards out with ease this is not the wallet for you, all of card take work to get out because there is glue holding the seams together, that gets all over your cards and makes it very tough to get out. There is nothing worse then when you are trying to pay and you are sitting there struggling to get your cards out of your wallet."
4738,3,"I was looking for a slim wallet and because I""d lost mine, needed a new one right away. This one was well-reviewed, so I gravitated toward it. However, when I saw the color I liked wasn't going to be delivered next day, I quickly chose a similar color and added it to the cart, which was going to be delivered the next day. I got it and opened it and realized it wasn't what I remembered looking at. Going back to the product page, it becomes clear (after some clicking) that there aren't just 21 color options--these 21 color options are spread over at least 2 (maybe more?) different styles. They should really, really be different product pages. I'm returning this to Amazon and am quite frustrated the seller was so careless with this. In fact, the product descriptions for the two different styles are identical.Other: Money protrudes from the money pouch rather than staying fully tucked inside. That's a downer. Leather is soft and feels good, though. Because of the reviews I""m going to try again--have to order a wallet anyway."
4739,3,"I ordered the Seattle Darkgray one. It has 4 slots for cards, and it has a side slot to store cash folded in half. It does not have a clear window slot with a finger glide to place my ID. It does not have 2 side slip pockets for business cards. The item I received is not as described in the product description. It looks like there are actually 2 different products here. While the product I received is decent and very minimalistic, it is lacking for my needs and purposes. Make sure to look at the item picture because they are not all the same."
4740,2,"Initially it seems like a nice wallet. Compact, lightweight, fits nicely in my pocket and easily shows my ID. However not even one month later, it is starting to rip and tear along the bottom edge where it holds my credit cards and I'm afraid they are going to fall out soon. As you can see from the photos, I have not even overloaded the wallet. Each slot only contains one card, and I barely ever keep cash in the wallet and when I do keep cash its only a few bills at most. I guess that's what I get for going cheap on the price. You get what you pay for...I just wish it was higher quality as advertised. I never ever had a wallet rip and tear in such a short period of time. Spend the extra few dollars and get something nicer."
4741,3,"I loved this wallet. It’s slim and relatively well built. Relatively.This wallet was perfect until month 8. Then every closed seam popped. See pictures; all of those seams are on the “closed” end of the wallet.I contacted the seller to take advantage of the warranty. They quickly replied not to worry and to send my address. I have not received a response since sending my address or following-up to ask if they sent it. It has been 3 weeks.If they responded, this would be 5 stars. Instead, I just ordered a competitor’s product.I will update if mdr responds, I promise!"
4742,3,"Arrived roughly a month after I ordered it yay Amazon Prime! I had already returned from my trip I was going to use the slim wallet for to lighten my purse, etc. I had to buy something different. Every time I was offered the chance for refund the system bugged out and didn't do it. The ""wallet"" finally came, very light and not particularly durable but not usable to me. Again it was too little value and definitely arrived too late. Something seriously not okay with this shipment or company providing product with such awful, unexplained, un-remeditated delays."
4743,3,"I purchased this wallet for myself, then my dad after he expressed interest in it. These were bought in August of 2018 and both began falling apart in November of 2018. I really wanted to love this wallet due to its nice looks and slim profile that can hold 9 - 10 cards, but the durability is a joke. The worst part is, I never sit on my wallet! It's always the first thing out of my pocket when getting into my truck or sitting down at the office due to back issues. I wish they would use real leather, or at least nicer fake leather and better stitching."
4744,3,"I thought this one would be perfect... It had everything I was looking for, a slim bifold wallet with an ID window, RFID blocking, and a designated pocket for bills without having to fold them.Unfortunately, it was quite a disappointment... It's advertised as ""thin"" but my old trifold is thinner... perhaps it needs worn in, but I didn't keep it long enough to give it that chance. The reason for the immediate return is that a single card is so hard to get in and out; I couldn't imagine using it on a daily basis."
4745,2,"Very stiff and plastic-y feel, and look. I would hate to see what it was like b4 it was improved. Very much an inexpensive wallet that looks and feels inexpensive. I only bought because it was an ""Amazon choice"" and description said premium synthetic leather. It is not in my opinion anything close to premium. It is just OK.UPDATE: 1 month later and it is no better, after using daily in my pocket it is still very stiff and inflexible. The card slots are tight and difficult to remove the card from. Revised rating down one star. Will buy a different wallet."
4746,2,"I like how slim this wallet is but it doesn’t hold as many cards comfortably as my previous, thicker wallet. I would assume this is the expected trade off. Not necessarily a bad thing as it holds my essential cards and cash. Forces me to not build a “Costanza wallet”.Problem though is durability. I’ve been using the wallet for a year and now it’s beginning to fall apart. The ID pocket is starting to tear and the edge near the fold is starting to also break off. I don’t take my ID out excessively and never had this problem with my previous wallets with the ID pocket so this was disappointing. Had to take a star away for the durability. Hopefully it doesn’t worsen but I don’t think I’ll be buying another one if it does.UPDATE: The wallet continues to fall apart in several places. The ID holder is nearly completely torn open and now the cash pocket is separating. I've never had a leather wallet completely come apart the way this one has. I will stay far away from Hissimo products for now on."
4747,3,"This wallet would have been exactly what I was looking for if not for one little problem...money does not fit inside it. The problem is in the design- there are glue and durability flaps in the bottom of the paper money compartment that keep the money from going all the way into the wallet. I have tried ripping them out or separating the glue a bit but it isn't really possible without ripping the wallet apart. If you'd enjoy having a wallet where your money is sticking out the top at all times for the world to see by all means purchase this. I'll give them one thing, the pictures above don't lie."
4748,3,"The material feels cheap. If that were the only problem, I'd probably still give it 4 stars though because it functions like it's supposed to, and I like the attached transparent place to put my ID. I don't expect much when I buy a wallet for <$20.But the wallet I got is a weird, metallic-looking color. It's almost the same color as an old penny. It doesn't match the color in the picture at all."
4749,1,"Received the wallet. Very disappointed. Too bulky. About .5” bigger that regular wallets, makes it hard to keep it in my pants or anywhere really.Area for the cards: As you may see in my pictures, it’s easy to obtain the first card but very difficult to pull the other ones!!!Color: Color finish makes the wallet look synthetic or cheap!I wouldn’t recommend this wallet to anybody."
4750,3,"After ordering this I read other reviews for coffee-galaxy and realized I had fallen victim to the same thing - the wallet arrived sparkly. Turns out people usually don't want sparkly things unless they purposefully order them, but the images for this wallet do not show that it is sparkly. I am returning it because of the sparkle, but am going to buy a different brand because this one seemed very cheap and plasticy (definitely not leather)."
4751,1,"FIRST (and hopefully last)<U+2B50><U+FE0F> ONE STAR “AWARD”FALLING APART IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS.WORST WALLET AND PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE THRU AMAZON.Of all the leather wallets I have purchased in the past 50 years plus, never have I had a wallet start falling apart this rapidly.And despite minimal wear and tear having been protected from the elements (and from my back pants pocket) thanks to a Scott’s travel vest.“Looks good”aHas a design that should help protect credit cards.But I again—have never had a wallet wear out and stretch out so quickly thatwithin a couple of weeks, credit cards slide out of pockets.Poor leather?Bad construction?Old inventory that perhaps had been sitting on a shelf subjected to wide swings in heat and humidity?I’ve had to pick up credit cards that have slipped out of “the wallet” and on to the ground.Isn’t a wallet supposed to prevent that?Most wallets I’ve had tend to last at least a year or two or until I simply want a new one.Often, old wallets, because of the leather, are in good enough shape to retain old or extra cards.Not this baby.THIS WALLET I AM CHUCKING INTO A GARBAGE CAN.This “wallet”—I should have thrown out a month ago."
4752,3,"I got this wallet to have one that could show two IDs in a flip-out window. One side of the window is large enough to see an entire ID, the other side has a large border that covers a lot of essential information, meaning that you'd have to remove the card anyway, defeating the purpose. But the bigger problem is that the 'clear' plastic used for the window uses a horrible matte finish that makes the IDs blurry. Since I'd have to remove the 2nd ID anyway (because of the border), I thought about putting my insurance card there, but it's WAY too blurry to read any of the numbers on it, so it's kinda useless."
4753,2,"This is a poorly manufactured product. I have found glue seeping into one of the slots for credit cards. As a result, it became almost impossible to remove a credit card because the glue had secured it to the slot. I have twice had to remove the glue residue from the card with nail polish remover. Very dissatisfied with this product. Would not make this purchase had I to do it again."
4754,3,I order (what I thought was) a brand new money clip for my husband and I got a used one. Spent $15 dollars on this thing for it to look like it has been used for months by someone else. Blue jean stains from being in someone's pocket and worn edges from someone taking pulling it in and out of their pocket probably. Very dissatisfied with the item I received.
4755,3,"THE COLOR, THE TEXTURE, THE LEATHER, THE STITCHING. All different in the image. No, not leather...plastic. Mine doesn't feel or smell at all like leather. I am pretty certain it is not leather. Do these photos look like the same product to you? My wallet is on the left. The wallet I wanted to purchase is on the right. I would have to say I have been ripped off. I would also have to say this is false advertising. I now see so many other people complaining about the exact same issues. How in the world do they have so many good reviews? hmmmm."
4756,3,"I purchased the black wallet with the non-magnetic money clip and I was really excited when I got the wallet. It looked good, fit all my cards, and the money clip was nice and tight whether it was a single bill or 20. After 4 weeks of use I can't say I'm happy with the non-magnetic clip for 3 reasons.1. I attempted to remove a credit card I don't use very often located closest to the clip and it wouldn't come out even with the use of needle nose pliers. I removed the clip from the wallet and only then was i able to remove the card still using pliers.2. The clip was so tight that it tore my bills when i was attempting to remove them.3. The clip has slowly been putting a hole in the back pocket of my jeans over the past few weeks.My recommendation would be to get the magnetic clip. The wallet itself holds a lot, compact, and stylish. If it wasn't for the non-magnetic clip I would have definitely given this product 5 stars."
4757,3,"So I just got my wallet and so far I am not impressed. First of all, it advertises that it can hold 20 folded bills with the magnet, but mine can’t hold any more than 10 if I vigorously shake it. Maybe that is just the magnet I got, I don’t know. Also it advertises that it blocks RFID, but in the description it says it does not block RFID signals. Also I got the black leather one and I have opened the money clip maybe 10 times and it is already starting to get a fold mark below where the magnet is, so with that and based off of some other reviews I read, I’m not too confident the wallet will last very long, especially if I have to keep prying open the pockets to get to my cards because it is so tight. I also feel like by using this wallet I am risking destroying my credit cards because of the magnet. Other than all those negatives, I like the look and light weight of the wallet, it could be a little less wide to make sliding it in and out of my pocket easier, but I can’t complain because I believe it’s width is actually as advertised."
4758,3,"It’s a nice wallet but it doesn’t block RFID. I bought it for the RFID blocker, and I took it to work( where we use RFID scanners to enter through the doors) and no matter which pocket I put my ID card the scanner could still pick it up. I even had it in my pocket when I walked through a magnetometer metal detector and it didn’t set that off either!"
4759,1,"Based on the reviews of this wallet, I had hoped it would be a decent front pocket wallet, but in short order I found it to be sub-par. The biggest issue I found to be the 3 card slots did a poor job of keeping cards in their respective pockets, without the cards wiggling out and about. Leather quality was good and seam stitching as well, but not a wallet I'd recommend. Also a bit too thick to truly be what I would consider a front pocket wallet, especially when wearing jeans."
4760,2,"I bought 2 wallets and got really dissapointed.First of all it is not real Leather... this description is incorrect... maybe is PU Leather but it is not real leather.Second: I've tried both of them trying to see if the RFID blocker works... and guess what? It doesn't.I just lose money....really, really bad product."
4761,3,"Ive been eyeballin this wallet and finally got it. However I was just a tad dissapointed because its alittle bit smaller then what i would normally have throughout the years. But all in all its just different, just something that ill need to get used to.also keep in mind this is a slim fit wallet so that it fits in your front pocket! Some of us forget that."
4762,3,Was hoping it would be be slimmer. I like the look and overall it was a a good purchase for the price. But this wallet doesn't work because I was looking for slim wallets to get rid of pocket bulge. Did notice a big enough of a difference between this one and the one I was using before. But hey loosing any bit of cluncky wallet is a good thing. The best one I've tried so far was the Threads elastic wallets with a separate RFID blocking sleave.
4763,3,"This wallet looked good but not functional. It has six credit card slots but only one is big enough to hold a credit card and the rest are too tight and too narrow to hold a regular credit card. I don't understand, why the designer of this company ""invent"" these kind of mini credit card slots? Do they ever use them? Or they only have super tiny plastic cards in their wallet? Come on, it is not rocket science to make the slot big enough to fit a regular credit card!!! I am very disappointed about their wallet product because I like their leather belts and steel toe work boots. Wake up, Timberland!!!"
4764,3,"I had to return it. Though well made with good materials, all the pockets for credit cards, licenses, etc were too small for these items to fit. You could force the cards in with brute force so you stretched the material, but you couldn't get them back out without a pair of pliers and I mean this literally.I suppose they need to tune up the specs they send to whichever off shore contractor is making these things."
4765,1,"This is a seriously bad wallet with a design so bad I honestly can't fathom how anyone could sell this product, let alone charge $20 for it. The problem with this garbage wallet is apparent as soon as you put your credit cards and I.D. inside--everything is too small. The 6 credit card slots are grouped so close together the cards are right on top of each other making them impossible to easily remove and put back or even tell which card you are pulling out. The design also maintains too much steady pressure on the credit cards in the slots warping them. The driver's license slot is also too small making it very difficult to remove your identification if you need to hand it to a clerk. Avoid this awful product."
4766,1,"I was very disappointed in this product. The wallet itself is extremely thick, even when empty. It is uncomfortable to put in your pocket. Which might make the fact that the cardholders being too small to actually hold cards a good thing. They designed it so you couldn't make it any more uncomfortable to sit on because you can't actually use it to hold the things a wallet is supposed to hold! Smart!Do not buy this unless all of your credit cards happen to be a centimeter or two smaller than literally every other credit card in use."
4767,3,"I finally understood the concern about the card slots. In the product pictures, you see staggered card slots. However, the actual wallet itself does not stagger the cards at all!!! Look at the pictures I posted. You can see that the cards are stuffed in the same height! This means the outermost card(green) is the easiest to remove. The other 2 cards are almost un-removable unless you remove the top card(s). This is the most inconvenient design I have ever seen in a wallet. Seriously, to get to card 2 or 3, I have to remove the top cards? What kind of design is this?I'll try out the wallet, but I doubt I'll use it for long. Unless of course, you are a user who only uses 1 or 2 cards, then it won't be inconvenient for you.The material itself is good though, soft smooth feel and it's light. One star for material. -4 stars for the super lousy design..."
4768,2,"I have to amend my earlier review because I have had this wallet for just over a month and the ""stitching"" (an area of glued together leather with inlaid string designed to look like stitching) is already coming apart! I am super bummed. I guess I got what I paid for. To be honest, I'd have likely been better off spending the same money at Walmart. Probably would have gotten a better quality wallet."
4769,2,"As soon as I opened the package I was disappointed to see the wallet doesn't even close right. Then, when I open it there is some sort of crust on the second flap. After that I open the to the middle of the wallet and notice something on the clear part so I put one of the cardboard pieces in to find its extremely dirty. I'm just disgusted and disappointed. I bought this as a birthday gift for someone and now I'm going to have to find something else. Well this was definitely a waste of money."
4770,3,"Just bought this trifold wallet but will not use it. It appears to be of pretty good quality, for the price, but the slots for credit cards are way too narrow. I no longer have the grip of a younger person and can only remove the cards with great effort. Also, since the leather is not real thin, the trifold construction makes it thicker than I like, and not as slim as they would like you to believe. . Should have known better; gonna have to ditch this one and go for a bifold. Should be thinner and have wider slots."
4771,3,"I bought this recently in Black Pebble style for my dad - he was using a 10-some-year-old wallet that I bought for him when i was still in HS (made me go awww a little, if it wasn't literally falling apart at the seams). And before someone rag at me for buying such a cheap replacement, 1) he's ultra cheap himself and probably would've threw a gasket if i buy something expensive and 2), I'm a little iffy with buying online sight unseen because it's hard to tell the feel of it.I was right on #2 - despite the rave reviews, I got the Black Pebble wallet and it feels...rather cheap. First, there was lint everywhere with cheap cardboard/paper inserts in the wallet that looked super cheap. Second, it just feels...the hand feel just does't feel right. Even though it's supposed to be genuine leather, the pebbling felt more like styrofoam? Something about it just didn't feel right to me.I gave it to my dad anyway because his money was at risk of falling out of his last wallet. Plus, with how cheap this was, i think i pretty much got what I paid for lol. I am going to let him live with this wallet for now, and when i get around to going shopping, i'm going to keep an eye out for a nicer wallet. There are more expensive wallets on amazon of course, but again the sight unseen thing - and in this case, clearly the ""hand feel"" is important!"
4772,3,The reason I purshased the wallet was mainly for the picture plastic insert. But when I filled it the wallet became too large and bulky. Beware you can’t fill all of the slots. Not too impressed with that feature. But I am really impressed with the wallet. It is high grade not plastic. Leather. Thanks. So between the good and bad that is why I only gave a three in three rating.
4773,3,"I went through so much trauma getting this color from amazon during a lightening sale I don’t even know what to do with myself lol But I finally got it, it’s here, and it’s so cute. The purpose and convenience of this was that my phone would fit, but that idea is out the window. It does NOT fit an iPhone 8 Plus with an otter box defender with a pop socket. I will not return because I do occasionally change my cases to thinner ones, however I’m still concerned if it’ll fit with the pop socket. I’m hopeful that my thinner cases will fit with this, but I have a feeling that this will be sitting on my coat rack for a long time seeing it is NOT practical for someone who has several cards. I need more than 14 card slots to be happy, and this barely has any. But I’m not taking points off for that because I knew this would be my I just wanna take a few cards and my phone type of purse, or maybe even a travel one when I’m out of town. The purse is beautiful and the dimensions are accurate even though it’s bigger than I expected, but that makes me happy. Overall I say 3/5 stars because my phone simply does not fit."
4774,3,"This item was purchased in 03/2018. Never used until 05/03/2019. In two weeks of actual use this was noticed today,05/18/2019.The seam has pull apart and now looks rather tacky.Another defect is it should have two snaps for cell phone one at either end so larger phones like a Galaxy S9 plus can be snapped in. It fits well,but unable to snap.This is the first poor review I have given a product. I wish I could return it, but site states window for return is over 04/03. So I am going to have to come up with something else. I have a cruise coming up and thought this would be perfect."
4775,3,The case is pretty and fits a lot of cards and space for money etc. However it does not fit my S8 Note!!!!! I do have the phone in a case and I can shove it into the pocket but cannot fasten the snap so I endded up putting it into the zipper part. Why would they not make the tab big enough? They really don't believe the thin material of the case is protection enough and an unprotected phone being taken in and out of the case is not a smart idea.
4776,3,I loved loved this wallet when it came in two months ago. I’m a stay at home mom with a 8 month old so it was perfect for when we would go out and I would just bring this wallet and his diaper bag. I do not use this wallet everyday since most days we do not leave the house so I was very disappointed while we were out yesterday that the wristlet completely broke off right above the stitching! It wasn’t any of the hardware that broke but the leather itself.
4777,3,"I really liked this wallet at first. It’s super cute, and convenient. Two negative things: 1. When my cell phone is in the cell phone pocket, the sleeve pushes buttons on my phone. I you have any push notifications up on your screen, it’ll open it with the serve of the wallet. One time I phone called someone back. I only knew from hearing the faint ringing coming from the wallet.2. It broke already!! The little strap broke off today and I’ve had the wallet like 2 weeks only.So cute but bad quality."
4778,3,Just received this wallet. I can hardly look at it to review its features because of the strong chemical stench. I am afraid I will poison myself! What is wrong with you Chinese manufacturers? You don't need to use all those poisonous chemicals to ruin your products. Third time this has happened to me with Chinese products - I should know better by now!
4779,3,"The Wallet sure smelled like a leather but It was too smooth. Never seen leather that smooth. It didn't had that feel of leather which I have with my current wallet. The inside lining and the separation cloth between the two Bill's section was made with a thin Silk like cloth. Which I Don't like due to my past experience with other, same kind of wallets. They easily get torn and make it uncomfortable to use.The slots behind the ID card flap are smaller than any credit/debit card I have. I tried putting some of my regular business cards. They wouldn't fit either. Those slots are of no use.Overall, looked as shown in the pics. But didn't fulfill my expectations."
4780,3,I got this wallet based on everyone's reviews and my experience just wasn't that great. & I'm so sad about it. I bought this wallet for my boyfriend. It has all of the pockets however it feels and looks very cheaply made. It looks nothing like the pictures in the others comments and I feel a little cheated. That wallet is very ideal and it just sucks that we didn't get that.
4781,1,"Not very high quality. There were raw edges that weren’t cut evenly through and had fraying. Not sure if it’s called fraying for leather, but I wouldn’t recommend or buy again. The quality looks like a those flea markets where people set up tents and sells ten packs of socks for $3. I should have expected this level of quality for the price."
4782,3,First off this is a very nice wallet. However two of the credit card slots we're too small to fit the cards so instead of 9 slots I only have seven to use. Other than that the quality of the wall that seems to be very well done. It comes in a very nice Velveteen bag inside a presentation box. Very elegant-looking. I only gave it three stars because I took one off for each credit card slot that couldn't be used and I took one off for not catching an air like that in the factory. Other than that so far it seems to be very nice wallet.
4783,2,"I ordered multiple wallets from amazon to test out, and had the highest hopes for this one to end up keeping. Unfortunately, the build quality on this thing just isn’t that great. While I appreciate the overall design, it’s lack in build quality showed within a few days. The leather started looking ragged, and the stitching started falling apart. It already looks frayed and like it’s been used for 2-3yrs whereas I’ve only had it for 10 days. Moreover, the card release mechanism is sticky and doesn’t easily let cards out (although this isn’t as much of a concern). For the price (I paid about $35), I expected a product with much better build quality. I will be returning this and looking elsewhere."
4784,3,"I really like the idea behind this wallet. It's nice and slim but fits all my cards. It worked really well when I first got it and I was super happy with it. However, a month or two into using it semi-regularly, the opening mechanism started to stick, making it harder to get my cards out. I'm unsure if this is a normal occurrence or if it was just mine. I expected this wallet to last longer for the price. It still works, but it is harder to operate now. The lever also sticks open once opened and has to be manually put back into it's normal spot."
4785,3,This is the only wallet that I found that holds 4/5 cards. I own two others that can only effectively hold 3. The money band is a little hard to quickly get the money in and out but on looks it’s the best looking I have. The reason for a 2 star reviews comes from the extremely weak and Ineffective card trigger. (The most important part that ejects the cards) it barely even releases them making the whole thing very useless.
4786,3,"Instead of swiping my wallet over card readers like I used to, I now have to pull out cards out. I tried putting RFID cards in the external pockets on either side of the wallet but they're not picked up by card readers, except for very sensitive ones, at specific angles.Also, the inside cards pop out 2mm apart, it's hard to identify them and pull one out, except the top and bottom ones."
4787,3,"Pretty decent wallet with a slim profile, the leather is a nice touch to that premium feel. The slide mechanism works like it should, comes with 2 money bands but it's better to use it with out the leather casing (kind of damaged the leather getting the band on and taking it off) Also the cards will stay put in the wallet even if you flip it upside down, you would have to shake it like crazy to have the cards slide out. Even if you only had one card in the slot it wont come out. The cons I have with this wallet is the slide mechanism does not push your cards as far as the picture shows which kind of sucks. It serious pushes them like 1 centimeter a part. One of the pockets on the leather casing are WAAAAAY to deep, I end up getting some money stuck in there it took awhile to get it out. I also got some threading that's coming off already which is a bummer when I only had it a week. Over all it's ok if you carry small amounts of cash and about 6 cards it's good. But if you carry more than that skip this wallet."
4788,2,THIS IS NOT LEATHER. REVIEWS MUST BE FAKE. VERY UNHAPPY. GOING BACK.Over half the credit card pockets/slots are glued together.Feels like cheap vinyl.I just got back from a local retail store. Looked at the same wallet. Completely different with quality and stitching.Do not believe the positive reviews.AMAZON YOU NEED TO GET IT TOGETHER WITH ALL THESE COUNTERFEIT GOODS AND WITH ALL THE FAKE REVIEWS.I LOVE YOU BUT IM READY TO LEAVE YOU!!!
4789,2,"This is a longer term review. After a year of use, the surface of the leather has started to flake off and falling off pieces at a time. This is an unusual development and the first time I have experienced with an item made from leather. I am now have serious doubt this is really made of leather as it its claimed. My last leather wallet lasted much longer and the part that broke wasn't the surface. Therefore, if you are looking for longer term use, I would stay away this particular brand/design of the wallet."
4790,1,"All I wanted was a new wallet for my bf's bday because his is over 5 y/o already, but when I received my order I was very disappointed. The leather doesn't feel like genuine. The wallet's trim is just horrible, something that you won't wanna give away as a gift. I just can't believe this is Tommy Hilfiger brand, really disappointing. Its either a really bad brand or simply a fake. Think twice before buying this product guys! Specially if its for someone important."
4791,3,"I have a trifold wallet I've been using for years, and wanted something different. So after seeing the reviews, I thought I'd try this one. People mentioned how it was thin, and I liked the looks.It arrived in the nice leatherish box, and that was about the best thing about it.I understand that things start out stiff - I'm in my 40's, so have been using wallets for a while. But this one was impossible. The slots for the cards were so narrow that I had to use an insane amount of force to get them shoved inside, and for one, I needed to grab a needlenose pliers to pull back out because it was so tight that I couldn't get enough of a grip with my fingers and thumb to pull it out again.It wasn't as thin as it seemed people made it out to be, as it was just barely thinner than my trifold wallet. It was much shorter than I would have preferred as well, so it's a very shallow spot to store bills and if they're just a little bit tilted, it sticks out the top on one side or another.I liked the looks, and could have gotten used to the rest of the issues, but those impossible to use credit card slots just ruined it."
4792,1,"This review is for the buyer, like me, who wants a wallet that doesn't send the message that you're homeless.It's not sturdy. I recommend that you avoid this brand and try a different one. I included pictures that show how the wallet came torn out of the box. The material on mine was so low-quality that it did not survive shipping! If your wallet comes out okay, it's likely it won't survive one season. If you look at the box, it appears you're spending more on the box for this wallet than the wallet itself. To me, that's a message from Tommy Hilfiger that says, ""We want you to think you're getting quality that you're not."" No thanks!I give this wallet two stars because it came from Amazon and saved me a trip to Walmart, which earns it forgiveness, alongside the fact that it's larger than my last Walmart brand. This TH wallet also has clunky photo slips, which do nothing for me, and it has very little space for credit cards, which I need. This wallet would suit you better if you carried cash on you -- but that's a risk, considering this wallet would quickly tear and your money would fall out."
4793,3,"Depending on your need, this might work well for some people. It has a nice area for cash/change and appears to be made of a quality material. The things I don't like is the zippers do not slide easily and if you are holding it, you really don't know which side the cards are on and which side is the cash department. It also is much thicker than other RFID blocking wallets which means it will not easily fit in a small bag. I was looking to replace the aluminum card holder I carry, but this isn't it."
4794,1,"Unfortunately, this wallet is not made well. It has two zippers. One zipper doesn't run smoothly and the other doesn't work at all. I cannot even open the wallet to see the interior. Where is quality control? Don't they check products before selling them?Not only would I not purchase this wallet again due to poor workmanship/quality of materials, but from what I've read,[Google RFID Card Theft and the Reality--I can't post the link for some reason), most people don't have credit cards that use an RFID signal. According to this article, FAR less than 1% of credit cards use RFID signals so we are protecting ourselves from something that is an insignificant risk.This article also suggests that tin foil works as well as the product used in this wallet in safeguarding the less than 1% of credit cards that use the RFID signal.In addition to having purchased an inferior product poorly constructed, I feel that I've been scammed. However, it is probably my own fault for not researching better before making my purchase. I do NOT recommend this product."
4795,3,I was pleased with the color. I was not as happy with the zipper. I am going to try rubbing some oil on the zipper since it is so stiff. Next I noticed how the credit card storage locations and liked what it saw.. But I am not nearly as happy with the other zippered compartment which resembles a change purse but was shocked to see that there were large holes at the bottom so may this section of the wallet is not for change? I don't get it because it sure looks like a change purse though.
4796,2,"I really, really don't like this wallet.There is no reason, that I can see for it to be this thick and bulky.My mistake for buying it.It doesn't have a pocket for currency.And it's hard to fit paper currency into the zippered cash section.As to the coins?The way this thing is designed, the coins keep slipping into the side folds and fall out when you unzip the wallet.AND despite being bulky, you cannot see the cards the way you can in a wallet that has transparent pockets.I am going to buy a new one."
4797,3,"This is the second wallet I have purchased. I had the first one for a little over a year and the zipper broke. I was very hard on the wallet and over stuffed it. I went to purchase another one. Last time I got pink so this time I went with the silver. I got the wallet and started to transfer the items and noticed the wallets is not as wide as the older version. This one also has a little zipper pouch for change. I put some change in there and was unable to get it out because the pouch is so small it doesn't let the change out. So the pouch is a ""0"" they took out the little side pockets in that zipper area so that sucks. In the old one I could hold 3 cards per slot easy not the new one. I think the zipper on this one will give out super easy. Wish I could get one of the old ones!"
4798,3,"I live the design of the wallet and the money clip is secure. However, it stretches out easily and causes cards to slip out easily. For the pull tab compartment I kept my Amex Platinum, Gold, and Sapphire Reserve. Granted they are metal cards and thicker than most but if I were to remove one of them then the other two would fall out easily. Same for the inside compartments. I kept my debit card and Freedom card in one slot and they fall out easily too.So 5 cards in addition to my license and all compartments are loose. If I were to hold my wallet upside down all or most of the cards would fallout.I do like the design as I stated. It’s sleek and well made. I can hold a decent amount of cash and it is the best travel wallet. It’s a shame that I have to keep more cards than I would like so I don’t lose any."
4799,3,"The wallet looks great, I got the Texas brown. The leather looks and feels good. I think it has a good amount of card slots for a minimalist wallet. The money clips works great as well!HOWEVER, on the day of using the wallet, I had to pull my ID out and this happened. The seams holding the cloth under the ID slot came completely out. Now the cloth is bunched up in the ID slot rendering it completely useless and leaving me very disappointed.Hopefully, SERMAN BRANDS will make this right."
4800,3,"Review only for ""California Desert"" color due to strong (and disgusting) turpentine/leather dye odor. I previously ordered a Slate Gray wallet and had no such issues and the wallet design was so phenomenal I decided to order an additional color. Unfortunately I made the mistake of ordering California Desert and the leather dye smell is unbearable. I let it air for a week with little improvement. It is unusable and so ""wet or moist"" with dye it would likely stain business cards or other items. I've contacted the seller today and will update. The is so disappointing mostly because the first wallet was exceptional. I must say the wallet design itself is exceptional and the card strap is ingenious."
4801,2,"I went from the George Castanza wallet to this one and I loved the size and design of it. After a few weeks the 'ribbon' you pull that will lift your credit card out tore off. I decided to keep it anyway as again, great design. Fast forward 11 months and the clip that holds your cash failed one day and I ended up dropping all of my $s on the ground. I was in a hurry to get a new one as I was traveling so I simply reordered a new one hoping for better luck. What I don't appreciate is the co-founder of this company hounding me to review his product multiple times - well he gets his wish with a 1 star rating. Also frustrating is that this was listed as a Prime item and it arrived late so it missed the trip I needed it for. The 1 star rating is for the product itself but I would gave the same one for the company."
4802,3,"Had some major issues with the product. First off, I purchased this wallet 6-7 the months ago and today I have a different wallet (ridge wallet). The first issue I ran into was that the seams of the material were coming out within approximately 2 months. Second issue was the fact that the wallet was staining everything it held (both cards and cash). The staining was so bad that I began to become reluctant to pull a card out knowing it may stain more. Lastly, the wallet claims quick and easy card access to your main card but the card is rather difficult to pull out because it tends to slightly stick to the wallet. This could be due to humidity or a warm environment. All in all, the trouble is not worth the price. Now to replace my inaesthetic cards."
4803,3,"Did anyone notice the hole where you place your bills at. My concern is not for the bills, but rather any change you might put in? I did not notice this in any of the comments or in the advertisement that there is a hole. I don’t carry much change, but find that I do have some every so often in my wallet. It does not have a compartment for any change and where you might put some there is a hole on both sides. For that I will give this product 2 Stars. The wallet overall feels OK for the price. You’re better off getting a Wallet from Ross if you want it cheap. I personally am lazy to go out and find a quality wallet and thought I might purchase one online. It’s just a wallet, right? Just so you know this one comes with a hole. Cheers."
4804,3,"One of my very few negative reviews, but one which I feel is deserved, based on my experience with this item. I ordered this wallet last October, to replace my old one, which I had bought at a garage sale about 7 years ago for $6 and used until it was too small to hold my growing collection of credit and membership/frequent buyer cards. Decided I needed something with more slots for cards and overall more room. Picked this up for less than $15 to give it a try.Looked nice at first - smooth leather looked clean. plenty of room for credit/debit cards, though the window slot where i kept my drivers license was very tight and made it difficult to remove whenever I had to hand that to anyone (*cough cough* police officers). Wallet worked fine until last month, when I noticed a small tear beginning on the lining on the left side of the wallet. Soon after, the right side lining tore wide open from the leather, creating an opening wide enough to let anything stored in that pocket to fall out when you unfold the wallet.Unacceptable.Can't absolutely vouch for the effectiveness of the RID blocking, but I can say that - while I had this wallet - noone stole my identity or spoofed any of my cards... they just kept falling out due to the ripped lining.Replaced it last week and threw this on in the trash.Gave two stars because it is a nice looking wallet - just need to improve their quality control and enlarge the D/L slot and I think they'll have a good product."
4805,3,"My primary reason for buying the wallet was for the extra bill pocket. There is plenty of room for cards and the flip ID pocket is a nice touch. But this is only a tree star rating because, like a good pair of shoes, it takes time to break in a wallet (guys will understand this.) The leather seems a bit on the thin side. I am used to heavier leather. The wallet is also a little bigger than my Fossil (which I have had for over ten years and shows no signs of any wear and tear) and which makes it feel a bit bulkier in my front pocket. If it doesn't work out for me, the wallet did not cost that much in the first place."
4806,1,"This average quality wallet is made from genuine leather and other materials with RFID protection. The leather is thinner than I expected for this price range. I had been looking on Amazon for a reasonably priced wallet with RFID and most I saw were in the price range of $10 to $20 dollars for a bi-fold. The $10 wallets looked cheap -- patent leather cheap. What caught my eyes about the wallet I ordered from GintaXen (02 Coffee) was its beautiful and luxurious top grain texture. I could almost smell the tanning process! Most of the photos I saw of Gintaxen's line of leather wallets all showed beautifully textured and rich looking leathers. It can be rather impressive when you pull out such a great looking leather wallet to make a purchase or to show your ID. That's what I'd hope to get from GintaXen after seeing their marketing photos. But looks can be deceiving! In this case it was. The beautiful photos are the BAIT to get you hooked. After that it's the luck of the draw if you receive exactly what you ordered. Bait and switch, get it?When I received my wallet the order form said 02 Coffee but it looked nothing like what I ordered, more like a cheap patent leather rip-off! It was very smooth and the color was more pale brown than dark coffee. What happened to that beautiful top grain texture? And I could not find the exact same wallet that I received in the marketing photos on Amazon's store page. So, did somebody ship me just any brown wallet they found at random?I hope not. Indeed, natural leathers can vary, and those top grain textures are typically added during the manufacturing process on genuine leathers. I realize that. But that's what I wanted. what I actually got looked more like a little kid's first wallet made from poly-urethane aka nubuck or PU leather. Kind of stiff like it too rather than soft and supple which top grain and genuine leather feels like. Substantially more glove leather-like would've been nice. What I got wasn't impressive at all! My warning to everybody is to beware that what you order might not be what you get -- if you're unlucky like me. But I'm not sending mine back, my old wallet was falling apart at the seams and I needed a new one pronto. But I might give this one to charity after I re-order -- just NOT a GintaXen wallet. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice -- well, you get it...For a few dollars more I could've gotten a genuine Buxton top grain leather wallet that I know would've looked and felt like genuine leather! Or I could've gotten a Levi's wallet with RFID for about $10 more where quality and beauty is assured! Sorry, I cannot recommend GintaXen wallets. Buyer beware!"
4807,3,"This product is not what is shown to be. The quality of the leather is below, below average. I do not like the texture of the wallet and it is not flexible like a higher-quality wallet would be. this was a gift for my husband, and he is not one to return things; as he is very grateful for anything I do for him. Either way, if it wouldn't had been for him needing a wallet as my son's dog chewed his last one, I would have returned this. Again, not good quality leather."
4808,2,"I had a bi-fold wallet before and was happy with it until it wore out. After reading the reviews and description of of this wallet I thought it would be better than my bi-fold. I have never been more wrong. I could not get all my plastic cards from my bi-fold to fit in this wallet. After using it for a while I learned to hate it. The one card holder is sewed into the wallet making like a hinge that flops open every time you open the wallet, making it cumbersome. They could have made it removable. But even then the card pockets are too small making it hard to get your cards in and out. It is already in my trash can."
4809,3,"One star because I had to give one to rate the product. The card slots are too small, and if you force a credit card in good luck in getting it out. I carry a good number of credit, ID ,etc. and I thought the number of slots would be an advantage. Wrong. If you fill all the slots, not only are the wedged in so tightly that you need pliers to get them out, the wallet is as thick as a dictionary. It was cheap so I'm not bothering to return it, but it will soon be an addition to my grandson's toy box."
4810,1,"I bought this wallet because it had so many reviews that seemed ok, the price was ok, and I do not use my wallet a whole lot so I had low expectations. Today, after using it for about three weeks, I finally threw it away. The wallet has a VERY strong chemical smell that even my husband noticed, and it left a 'tingling/itchy"" feeling on my skin whenever I touched it. I suppose this comes from the chemicals. The wallet is NOT a Swiss product, as the name misleads one to think, it is made in India. Even after giving it weeks to air out, the smell was still just as strong. I do not recommend buying this wallet. Invest the extra money to get a safe product from a trusted brand."
4811,3,"The wallet is well-enough constructed: the stitching seems good, the materials are solid, and the plastic is adequate. The reason I'm giving this a low review is because it's quite loudly advertised as an RFID-blocking wallet and it doesn't do that at all. I stuck an RFID card into the wallet, closed it, and put it near a reader--sure enough, it lit up just as if I'd waved the card in front of it. I tried this several times in different configurations and got the same result every time.If you're looking for a plain wallet, this is good enough. If you're looking for something that actually blocks RFID, this is a terrible choice. If your company has a security policy about that sort of thing, you could end up being the weak link in the system despite your best intentions."
4812,2,"The wallet looked good upon arrival, but once I tried to place the credit cards inside, none of them fit. I tried and tried but it was just sewn to tightly together. I could deal with snug, but once the card is in, I could pull out a checkbook, write and sign the check, check the score of the Blackhawks game on my smartphone and walk to my car before being able to pull the card out of its slot. It's a shame because I really needed a new wallet and I thought this was going to be the one. Maybe alpine Swiss can step up their QA/QC procedures and I will try again down the road, until then, I'll have to return this wallet and drive to the mall to get a new one."
4813,3,"The wallet fell apart after 2 months. The stitching is poor and the material is too thin, so it tore apart. Don't trust the high star rating. There's too many sponsored and low quality reviews on this product. I bought this on an impulse and I deserve what I got. I should have scanned the reviews for these sponsored and fake reviews.Edit Jan 30, 2017: In fairness to the seller, I accepted a replacement two months ago and the it has held up better than the original. It's still intact, no stitching has been torn. May be I received a defective wallet the first time."
4814,3,"The wallet ripped along a seam after exactly 3 weeks. Cheap crap. The pockets were very hard to get my cards out of. The 2 I used most, my main card and my DL, were very tough to get while using this wallet, almost like someone had glued the cards in. It was seriously a struggle EVERY time to get a card out. I had to grip the card as hard as I could, then pull. Learned to pull in a way so I didn't hit myself in the face or hit other people once it finally came loose. At first I thought, well maybe my body heat is causing the cards to stick to the wallet material. Nope. I experimented by trying to get cards early in the morning when my wallet had been sitting out all night, I even pre-loosened the cards when I went to bed! Figured that it's just the breaking in period, eventually cards will slide easy, but the wallet ripped open after 3 weeks. Glad it happened inside the return window and glad amazon is so good for returns. I wasn't able to test the RFID blocking capability, but I would guess its quality is on par with the rest."
4815,1,"In fairness, a closer look at the picture on Amazon would have saved me returning this, as I could have seen if I zoomed in that this is not, as advertised, vegan leather (aka cork leather/cork fabric). Real vegan leather made of cork is pretty cool. It looks beautiful and is both soft and durable. It is not some chunks of cork lightly glued to a mesh with huge spaces in between.The wallet layout is great: reasonably thin, ID window, room for just the right amount of cards and a spot for folded bills (if you must). I will be looking for a similar design elsewhere. But while I can't actually speak for the other fabrics, if they are as cheaply constructed and fake as this cork ""fabric"" I would not recommend them. Spring a couple more bucks for something that's not going to disintegrate in your pocket!"
4816,1,"I've had this wallet less than 6 months - the glue that holds it together is leaking into the card slots, which causes the cards to stick and get coated in the tacky glue.Would have expected this to last at least a year. The wallet itself externally is in perfect condition, but spending almost 5 minutes to get a card out, and now having to gently wash all my cards with soap and water is very discouraging.Would not recommend buying one until the quality issue is checked out."
4817,3,"The look of the wallet is not bad, but its not really good. Based on other reviews it seems there is a real lack in quality control and consistency. The one i received is so tight that it can barely hold 1 card in each slot and when they are full i cant open the center pocket for paper bills. If i add a card or something to the couple other internal slots its even worse.Regarding RFID blocking, as with any open wallet you have to be careful how you put your cards in. almost all cards with an RFID chip will have that chip on one end of the card or the other. if you hold the card up to a bright light you can usually see it. When testing this wallet i found that as long as the end of the card with the chip was put in first my reader could not pick up the card, however if the card is put in the other way, with the RFID tag outwards, then i could.Aso the ID slot does not provide any RFID protection, i assumed this in the beginning based on the original pictures. So those that have newer ID's that have RFID tags in them should be aware of this."
4818,3,"Solid construction and at first, it was great--but I noticed 3 very important and irritating things that make me regret the purchase:1. Most foreign currencies do not fit. Outside of the US, many countries have larger bills for larger amounts. I have been to at least 5 countries in the past year with currencies that are too large for this wallet (one of the reasons I got this was to protect my cards and money from getting wet while traveling.2. It holds credit cards so well that after just a few months of use, it will peel off/damage the edges of your credit/debit cards and other cards. Yes, you can call the credit card company to send you a new one for free anytime, but who wants to deal with that on a regular basis? Also, if a corner of the card breaks off when I'm trying to use it, that will be terrible. Of equal importance, it makes even a nice business credit card look worn and damaged...not the kind of thing you want to pull out at a restaurant with a client...3. Although it protects most of what's inside, you can't easily hold even 1-2 business cards in here, it will get very damaged before you even give it to someone (this is the case for most wallets, though).Point #3 is not a huge deal, but #1 and #2 are. I regret purchasing this product as a result--though it took me a long time to notice these issues so it was too late to return it."
4819,3,The worst thing about this product is the price. To expensive for some plastic. The second worst thing is that Dust still gets in it. I bought this wallet to protect my I.D.s and credit cards from dust and dirt that wears them out. For the price this should be built better. There should be a rubber seal that keeps dust out!
4820,2,"I switched to front pocket wallets a couple years ago and really haven't looked back. They seem to have more thought put into their design than back pocket ""Costanza"" wallets.I got sick of leather wallets getting over stretched. I'm coming from a Serman Brands wallet that had a very convenient pull tab for the main pocket and then a front card slot for my most frequently used card. I loved it but did not want to go in on another due to longevity issues.I don't know how I never came across this one before. I really liked the story about how it has evolved over the years. I also liked that it was a local company (Media, Pa). At $40 it was more than I wanted to spend but figured it would look at this one as an investment. After watching reviews on YouTube and reading here, I pulled the trigger.The Good:Super functional - everything works exceptionally wellCards don't fall out (really)SturdyCustomizable (with attachments)Comes in multiple colorsNice cash holderThe Bad:UGLY - there is just no way around this for me. It looks like a toy. I was a bit embarrassed taking it out at first but eventually got used to it because it is so darn functional. There are gaps all over the wallet also. It adds to the cheapness of the look IMO but maybe that's part of the evolution.Expensive - I paid $40 for this wallet but I honestly don't feel like I got a $40 wallet. There is just nothing that looser feels ""premium"" about it.Attachment purchase - I got the front card attachment from their website. The piece itself was overpriced for what it is (single piece of molded plastic). They also force you to pay shipping which I hate. Even being within 20 or 30 miles of their facility, it took quite a while to get to me.Thicker than I had thought- I'll try to get a picture on here. It bulges quite a bit in my pocket but not too bad.If you are definitely a function over form person, this will be great. It does work extremely well, I just now need to purchase another nicer wallet to have for other occasions. I guess I thought I could pull this off if it had a small enough footprint but it does not. I do plan to keep using it but will also keep an eye out for something a little nicer. I realize most other reviewers seem to disagree with me but hopefully this helps someone else make a more informed decision."
4821,3,"This product has received many great reviews. However imho, it has very limited space. The inside can only hold two cards on either side of that. The money clip is limited to only about not even 10 bills unless you want to put your money on the outside. The clip on the inside only allows one to have two cards if that. If someone wants to slide a business card while out doing business on a quick whim there isn’t any room. Other rfid cases allow so much more room than this. Returning."
4822,3,"I think the wallet is ok quality - very plastic feeling and the size is a little small. I wish it was a little bigger to fit my notes without crunching them. I wish they would make a higher quality version of this wallet and a little larger.Also the customer service is not great - they gave me a lot of issues trying to order from their website and would not ship overseas - they didn't even bother responding to my emails asking to clarify my order, they would just cancel it. I finally just ordered it from Amazon."
4823,3,"I really liked this wallet at first - the slim factor was a great trade-up for my older wallet, and while I've never been a fan of money clips - I actually like that in this wallet. I could fit all my cards in it and liked the ID Window - so all around a satisfied purchase.......and then about a month after I started using it - the stitching around the ID Window came loose. Since I use it to hold my Drivers License, which I have to take out all the time, the ID Window gets a lot of use and pulled apart along the seams. So I'm in search of a replacement wallet."
4824,3,"While the wallet seems to be well made and of quality material, there are a few glaring design flaws that led me to stop using it after a few weeks. The biggest concern is that since the money clip has a slight bend at its end, the clip ended up digging into the cards that were placed across from it, leaving indents in them. The other flaw is that since the clip is so tight, it makes it difficult to easily utilize the two card slots directly behind it, as it required a lot of force to put in and take out cards from these two places."
4825,1,"I bought this because it was described as a ""slim"" wallet. It is not slim. When I received it, it was larger (while empty) than my current wallet filled with cards and cash. The wallet is very nice and seems to be very well made, but I had to return it because it was much too big for me. The description is a little misleading. If you're looking for a nice, average-sized bifold wallet, this would be a good choice. If you're looking for a slim wallet, I would not recommend this one."
4826,3,"I liked the idea of having a slot on the front of the wallet for frequent cards. after having this wallet for a while the other slots are a little too tight for me and I really don't think they will improve over time. also the money clip makes it more difficult to place and remove cards on that side. I'm sure there are people that like this wallet, it's just not for me."
4827,3,"I have wondered if a minimalist wallet would be something I'd use ( I carry a lot of stuff in my wallet) BUT the picture of the TRAVANDO appealed to my sense of aesthetics. / Black with a orge/tan interior. If nothing else it would be a nice ""Night Out waller""Oh my. just got it. STUNNING. VERY light very soft leather. seems like careful construction VERY HAPPY. Oh the gift box IS very impressive As a gift .. NO ONE will say this was an under $30USD gift.My ONLY complaints:it smells of chemicals NOT real leather. (PLEATHER) Protein leatherThe money clip pressure interferes with 3 pockets. It is difficult to use and you do not want to put anything there if you want quick access."
