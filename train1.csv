When I spoke to Billy the General Manager after speaking to the reservation manager, i felt like they were using a script. Very cold, very poor customer service, would never consider them again.

I emailed Hunter boots explaining my issue with the fit of the boots and that I received them as a gift, so the online account they were purchased on would not match my name and that I wanted to exchange them for the Adjustable calf boots, which cost more, I am aware of that and willing to pay the difference. I did not receive a reply for 8 days, due to this delay in response I was already frustrated but was understanding due to high volume from the holidays. I got a response asking for multiple pictures of my product and I sent those over within 2 days. 8 more days go by until I receive another response from the company. The second response was from a different employee again asking for basically the same information I had just provided. My frustration level increased at this point due to the delay again and now I felt like I was not a valued customer because they did not care to even look into my issue, instead asked the same thing that was already asked. I provided the information again because I just wanted my problem resolved. 7 days later I receive an email from a 3rd employee confirming I am eligible for a like for like exchange, which is great, however that is not what I was asking for.

I provided the information requested and got a reply 2 days later saying my request could not be complete because I am not the person who purchased the boots. It is now Feb. 8, a month later, and I again had to explain that these boots were a gift and that I was just trying to get all this sorted out that they could refund the money to my friend after I sent the boots back. I finally got a return label and sent the boots back on Feb. 13. The refund finally was processed on February 27. I am shocked that a company that sells expensive products would have such a long turnaround time and lack of care for their customers. My refund process took 49 days, and 4 different employees to sort all of it out.

That got me so irritated .... as if I am making up stories about my complaint. ALL I WANT IS MY PURSE WHICH I PAID FOR. Not too mention their return policy really sucks.... after shipping to return I will be refunded for 10 to 14 days???!!! Unfair. Why does a customer like me suffer this long when it was obviously their mistake? Will definitely return the item to them, but I will cancel my order. I would rather spend the money to a more deserving store. No time to deal with this business that obviously does not see the importance of good customer service. Too bad they just lost one customer.

I do not live close to a store and drove half an hour each way to simply be told to call Zara later on with no help or care from employees or managers in the store. I went home and used the Â“chatÂ” feature online. I spoke with Manesha which was utterly useless. I spent an hour chatting with someone who was unknowledgeable and actually disconnected our chat when I asked to speak to a manager.

IÂ’ve been getting the run around that someone would call me with updates and no call was made. I had to continuously call for updates without any progress made in their part.

Upon arrival (our group did not show up all at once) the 1st arriving friends/family were seated in our reserved section and ordered...Â food & beverages from a waitress. When served the food (one of our guests were not satisfied with their selection, it was spinach dip and was visibly dry, she then asked the waitress if it could be changed/altered after tasting it. At this time the waitress began to become agitated by the request and rolled her eyes and told the guest that ""she already bit the food and could not change it"". Shortly after that the bill for that specific meal was asked for and when paid the guest did not leave a tip with the bill (at this time the entire group of people still have not arrived). Upon reviewing the check, the waitress returned to the table and confronted the guest pointing her finger in the face of the guest saying ""oh your not going to tip me!"" this resulted in the two having a rather loud discussion over the issue. As I use the word loud I would like to point out that this is a bar and music is played at high levels leaving any type of conversation to be loud. As the waitress left our seated area, more guests for our celebration arrived and purchased beverages from the bar area and food from the table area, approximately 20 guests. About 15-20 minutes pass and then security comes to our area and directly tells us that we need to leave and that all he knows is the waitress told him that we were being aggressive, rude and rowdy. All of which were just not true, this establishment was packed on both floors with drunk and disorderly people, the group of people who arrived with our party were not that. Any of their camera footage will show that. I was able to ask the security to speak with me to the side and asked him as to why he was telling our party to leave and that we have a reserved section. He then let me know that he would go and get the manager to help clear up the situation. Prior to the manager arriving I personally witnessed the waitress proceed to tell her manager the same lies she had told security to get us to leave. I then approached the manager as he was yelling at our party ""Who is in charge, who disrespected my waitress"". Trying to explain to him the situation with the service of his waitress all he kept doing was repeating himself ""Anyone who disrespect my staff has to leave"" and then just ignoring anytime myself or any one else from our party by pulling his phone out and looking down. This was completely handled unprofessionally and was a major inconvenience to even attempt to relocate a planned birthday celebration to another location at 11:30pm. Frankly the manager was very arrogant as if he has bar in NYC and will fill it anyway. This situation could have been resolved in a much better way than how it was handled. As we were forced to leave I was unable to ask for a refund on any food & beverage that was purchased as the majority of the goods & services could not be consumed or used.",146,51,52,1,"I reserved a section/table on the evening of Saturday December, 2017 at Hudson Terrace.

They kept lying and telling me ""Oh we didn't charge you twice, we reversed the transaction"" (which was another lie) because again they took a total of almost $1,400 from my acct.

She advices me does the opposite. Anyways, I called and the first lady I spoke to, put me on hold and spoke to the restaurant I believe. Then she told me that the restaurant's manager would like to speak to me and he was going to call me from the number on my account. Okay. He did called me right after and I tried to explain him the same thing as I did to everybody. You sent me a different salad than what was written on your online menu and I wouldn't order it if I knew it had mushrooms and green peppers and I simply want you to take back your salad and give back my money. He told me these things won't work that way that he sent me a cobb salad and he wouldn't give me a refund. When I didn't accept what he was trying to pull, he literally hung up the phone on my face.

However, I have not received any communication from the insurance carrier nor Ala Carte Entertainment regarding this matter. It is my understanding that Ala Carte Entertainment has a commercial insurance policy as mandated by local municipal law to cover injuries.

When we arrived at the event at 2:23 pm, we began waiting in a line that wrapped around the building. We did not move for almost 45 minutes. Then a huge thunderstorm caused us to run for cover at a neighboring establishment because the venue offered did not provide shelter. After the rain finally stopped, we got back into the long line for about an hour. We were so excited to finally reach the door. We reached the door at 5:17 pm. We waited in line for a total of 2 hours before entering. We received our 10 yellow tickets (per person) and our orange wristbands. To our unfortunate disappointment, we only entered the threshold of yet another line for all of the dessert vendors. The venue was extremely packed and very unsafe in the event of a disaster. Once inside, all of the customers were confused. None of the event volunteers knew details about what our ""Boozy Bites"" tickets bought us. We waited in line for another hour in hopes of receiving some of the promised samples. After the first 3 vendors admitted to being ""out"" of samples, my group decided to check out the outside vendors in hopes of using our 10 tickets for something. However, none of the food vendors would take the tickets. They did have a few free samples, but these were not the ""Booozy Bites"" we paid for. We then decided to try and at least get the ""ice cream brew"" that we were promised - only to find out that line snaked around and over a couple hours long.

No one at the door was capable of honoring my request. They were volunteers who were likely plucked off the street - they knew nothing about the festival details.

If a product is promised, it should be provided, otherwise this is sadly false advertisement.Â Every single customer at this ""festival"" was unhappy, and many of them wrote reviews on Facebook and Yelp. However, the owner of this establishment has since deleted many of the negative comments. Through some serious digging, I found out that last year's event was a disaster as well, the owner simply hid the negative comments to get more people to come this year.

While I was there, the service was EXTREMELY slow (they only had 2 bartenders for a widely advertised New Years Eve event), and the bartenders were pretty rude. Secondly, my boyfriend got thrown out for ""throwing up"" when he did not. I was with him the entire time. The security guard told me he just needed fresh air and would bring him back to where I was after. Now, the security guard didn't allow me to go outside with him when I tried, and ended up just kicking him out and not letting him back in (so I sat inside the club by myself for awhile before realizing he wasn't coming back).

If they tell you you're approved, the numbers don't matter, approval is approval. The only number that might increase is your down payment, but that will subsequently decrease your monthly payments; this is only done for security purposes as people with lower credit have a higher tendency to default on payments, so that is why dealerships feel more secure with a larger down payment and smaller monthly payments (easier for a person in debt to maintain smaller monthly payments). Wily dealerships, like this one, increase your down payment but do not decrease your monthly payments, they never explain any of this to you, they try to make it seem as people with lower credit have to pay more because they have lower credit, but there is no logic behind that, other than the fact that a person with lower credit ends up paying more for credit options in general because he/she tends to make lower payments and therefore ends up paying more in interest.

After the first hour, we started to notice a loud, frequent, thumping sound coming from the left front side of the car. This sound and the vibration associated with it, progressively got louder and louder to a point of concern. Due to our hyper-vigilance, we drove 15 miles off route to the nearest Lexus Dealership. Upon inspection, they informed us that the LUG NUTS were NEVER TIGHTENED to Lexus spec (see invoice from Lexus of Chester Springs). Due to the negligence of Lexus of Queens, we were told that our wheel had progressively been coming off the car and could eventually have completely fallen off while we were driving on the highway between 60-70 miles per hour.

Both the Manager and General Manager started off their conversations with me saying ""if your lug nuts were actually loose, you wouldn't have been able to drive more than 3 blocks without your wheel falling off"". This comment made the whole situation seem like a coincidence. Only after outright requesting an apology, did Tim the General Manager simply repeat the apology we asked for and say that the lug nuts being loose was ""highly likely"" due to their error but ""anything is possible"".

No one has returned my call.",191,105,106,2,"First, I'd like to point out that this was at the Massage Luxe in St.Charles, Mo off 5th street but there was no option for that so I clicked on the location that is listed as their world headquarters on google. I received a gift card to massage luxe for Christmas after requesting one from my...Â family. On 1/28/17, I redeemed my gift card. As I was about to leave they offered me a ""membership"". The girl told me it was only $10 to join and then there would be a monthly fee each month, BUT that the membership could be canceled ANYTIME. I explained that I would first have to speak to my husband before purchasing a membership and asked if I could come back up later that weekend to purchase if I decided to get it. She said that I would have to purchase it right then and there or I wouldn't have the opportunity to do so again as I wouldn't be considered a ""new"" customer anymore after I walked out the door. I again said I needed to speak with my husband first and if I couldn't do so then I would just pass on the membership. She then told me that I could go ahead and sign up, and if I changed my mind within 48 hours that I could come back up and get a refund for the $10. Furthermore, she told me after the 48 hours was up, that I wouldn't be able to receive the $10 back if I canceled, but I would be able to cancel ANYTIME as this was a month to month membership. I was reluctant but it seemed like a good deal and as a mother of five, I could benefit from a monthly massage, so I payed the $10. THREE separate times she reaffirmed that I could cancel at ANYTIME and I would only lose $10 if I canceled after the initial 48 hours. So a couple weeks or so goes by and circumstances in our home unexpectantly changed. My husband and I concluded that we could not keep this membership. So I called the location and the girl I spoke with said I needed to come in physically to cancel my membership. So two days later (Friday 2/24/17), I go to the physical location to cancel it. The girl working the desk enters my info in the computer. She then tells me there is some sort of error and she would have to have her manager cancel the membership when she came in the next day. She told me she was leaving a note for her manager about the problem and that I wanted to cancel and not be charged on the 28th. I asked her if I needed to do anything else and she informs me that her manager would take care of it and call me if they needed anything from me. So I assumed everything was taken care of. Then the morning of 2/28/17, my account was charged 58.88 for the membership. I called them and told them of the issue and the girl on the phone said she would have her manager call me back after she wasn't able to fix it. Two days later (3/1/17) the manager finally calls me back and tells me she can cancel my membership today, but she can not refund me the money I was overcharged. She says I signed a contract, but I did not. I signed a receipt that specifically says my membership is a month to month and I can cancel ANYTIME. I made multiple attempts to cancel my account BEFORE the billing date, and now that my account has been charged 58.88, they are basically telling me it's my loss. I WANT MY REFUND of $58.88 for services that I never received, nor wish to in the future after this nonsense.",192,106,107,2,"Went in to the st Charles MO location had massage time at 6 sat in the back for 15/20 min then massage was rushed since they closed at 7 and workers wanted to go home.

I paid 120$ for sitting and being rushed. I talked to and he said he would give us 50% our next massage?

The manager heard me talking to the rep at the front desk and came out to discuss some options with...Â me. The best option was to start a membership which would maximize the number of services I would get. I did have to give my debit card to initialize the service. The gift cards got me several service and got my account paid until 6/14/2017. During the transaction I told the manager I did not want to pay for services past what the gift cards would get me. She told me she understood and she put in my debit card and then after she got my account set up she told me she took my payment information out. I had my last appointment scheduled for 6/14/2017, unfortunately I wasn't going to make it so I called on 6/13/2017 to cancel that service. When I spoke with the representative she asked if I wanted to reschedule i said my account ends on 6/14 and she reviewed the account and agreed that my account was ending on 6/14/2017. I took that conversation as my account was showing cancelled. When I went to check my checking account in August my account had been charged a membership fee on 6/16, 7/16 and 8/16 in the amount of 58.88 each month. I called Massage Luxe on 8/22 and was explaining my situation to the rep and they where unable to assist me and took my name and number down and told me a manager would call me in the next day or so.

My eyebrows are uneven, opposite from the photo we agreed on, her work is terrible and it does not even resemble microblading. Instead of fine hair like strokes I have X signs on my eyebrows. My eyebrows are ruined, and it will take thousands to get this removed and corrected. Her advertising is for microblading, but she performed a different procedure. I payed for two services and she never gave me the receipt. Chased me out of her office saying that she has to keep her schedule. I have been trying to reach her for 4 days to ask for help and she is not responding. I payed for another appointment and she is not responding and refusing the service.

When I had my second visit in August, my first one on the package, I did not...Â have a great experience. The waxing did not remove the hair properly, and I had hair growing back on my lip and brow in less than a weeks time. I called the store to complain, and I was told my next visit would be on them. I showed up for my third visit in September, this one free because of my previous complaint, and had the same issue again, where the hair follicles were broken above the skin and not completely waxed, and I pointed it out to my technician, Kim, while still in the chair. I was told ""Oh Well,"" by her and that was the end of our interaction. All three of these visits were spread out from June to September, about 6 weeks apart each. Immediately following my third visit when checking out, I asked to speak to the manager, Holly, however she was not on site. I left my information for her to contact me. After a week passed and I had not heard back, I started calling and leaving messages with the receptionist for the always unavailable manager about once a week, none to be returned. In early November, I reached out to European Wax Center Headquarters for help with my problem. I was responded to by email, which I still have, apologizing and saying someone from the location in question would be calling me to discuss my problem. After a week, I still heard nothing so I reached out again to Headquarters, with no reply this time. A few more weeks passed and my mother, who was also a client there, canceled her future appointments with them until my problem could be resolved. At that time a new manager Laurie gave my mother her name and number to call to talk to. I called later that day, but she was already gone. I followed up with a few more calls throughout the month of December, always having to leave messages with the receptionist. Not one call has been returned.

I contacted the Tempe location again and the person said that I needed to cancel my account via email. She provided me an email address. I emailed that address saying that I wanted to cancel and wanted to be reimbursed for the few months that I had been charged. I never got a response from the email. In December I was charged again (and was for November as well) and I called and explained that I've been trying to cancel this membership and that I'd talked to two different people and got different answers and I sent an email and could my account please be cancelled and for me to be reimbursed.

Sure enough, that was the building. I parked my car in front of this building and went up to the door that was chained. There was no way to get in, and no one answered the door bell. After 5 minutes, a white truck drove up and a female got out of the passenger side. She went up to the door, unlocked it and did not introduce herself. She walked past me, I smelled marijuana.

Additionally, if I placed a stop payment on the card, on file, they (i.e., Massage Envy) would report due payment to a collections agency.Although I do not agree with the additional fee (of $65), I chose to pay lest I be forced into a continued membership against my will for unwanted services.

Due to my job situation and change in my economic status I completed a form to cancel my membership in May 2016. However, before I submitted my cancelation form my account was debited $59 dollars. I called Massage Envy to find out why the membership fee was now $59 dollars and why I never received any correspondence stating that the membership fees had increased. This further confirmed my decision to cancel my membership. The representative I spoke with emailed me the cancelation form and informed me that I had five pre-paid massages that I needed to use within 60 days of my cancelation notice.

However, he never asked for my name or phone number. I had to ask him if he was going to take my name and number so the manager would know to contact me. I then proceeded to ask about making an appointment so that I could use my pre-paid massages and he then informed me that my account has been suspended for non-payment. I told him that I submitted a cancelation for a month ago and that was no fault of mine.

Past complaints have been reported to the corporate office. Bottom line, I should be able to use the existing pre-paids that I have paid for and cancel my membership with Massage Envy. As far as I am concerned any agreement that I signed when I became a member at $49 dollars a month was breached the moment $59 dollars was withdrawn from my account because that is not what I signed up for nor did I ever receive any notification stating this change or sign anything agreeing to that change.

The manager called back and said that they came under new ownership in June so they would only be able to refund the June payment, and allow me to use my accrued massages. I responded that it was not any fault of mine that the form went unnoticed and there was a change in ownership. I followed the formal steps for a cancellation so I would need a full refund of the monthly payments that were taken out after my cancellation was in effect. The manager responded by saying he would speak to the owner and come up with a conclusion. The manager called back a couple days later after speaking to the owner and repeated the same solution he previously stated. This has been very stressful and not handled adequately.

We placed our order on June 28, began trying to get all the parts that weren't sent in the shipment on July 9th, and on July 17th, still don't have everything.

The tech came to my home and replace my screen within a hour, hour and a half of me making the call. When the tech finishes the service he demonstrated how the phone is in working condition, he has you make a call, try to type...Â on your screen and so forth. He also shows the camera and how it works as well. He turned on the front facing camera, then flipped it to the back facing camera. The tech only shows that the camera works at no point did I take a picture. My original problem was only with my front screen there is zero damage to the back of the phone what so ever. There is no damage to my back camera. Later in the week when I tried to take a picture with my back facing camera, I notice that the camera doesnÂ’t focus I literally have to tap my screen repeatedly to make the camera focus. Prior to the repair the tech examined my phone for any other damage and there was zero. This has only been happening since IÂ’ve had my screen replaced. I contacted PulsÂ’s customer service department Sunday May the 20th 2018, they then sent me a what they called a Guarantee Form to my email and said that a person from that department would get back to me within 24 hours. Later in the day I received a email reply from stating the following, Hello, Thank you for submitting your Guarantee request. We apologize that your device is experiencing complications following our services. We honor a lifetime guarantee on our parts that were used on your device and our installation as well. At this time, we are unable to correlate the issue that you are experiencing with our completed repair. However, we sincerely care about all of our customers' devices and want to help.

During this battery replacement, the technician cut a critical wire for my screen. This technician then went on to replace my screen. The issue is that Puls does not use the same Apple iPhone 7 screen, the...Â colors are different from the original Apple iPhone 7 screen. I pointed this out that 1) I did not want a screen replacement but since their technician damaged my phone, I had to get their screen replacement from a 3rd party screen & 2) The 3rd party screen has colors that are 'off' and different from the original screen than I had. They sent another technician on 01/07/2018 to replace the 3rd party screen with another 3rd party screen. The colors are still off and it was even noted by the technician during that visit that the colors are not right. The issues IÂ’m having are that the screen replacement voids my warranty with T-mobile, so it renders my phone unable to be traded in.

After all that, Puls Technologies Inc support team contacted claiming wrongly a defective product and want payment for a diagnostic service that I did not request, and further threatened with a collection notice even when I explained that service was not completed as promised. I hope you will look into this unreasonable practice of not disclosing before that they would demand fees even if their technicians fail to deliver the service, and that they would demand a payment for a service for false diagnosis that they make up, demand fees that they do not disclose at the time of requesting service. I saw many advertisements on TV about their service and thought that they have a legitimate business, and am certainly disappointed that their service feels like a scam after trying for the very first time.

If I had known that, I never would have made a reservation and had a technician come. Nowhere on the site does it explain that, and I had also indicated in my ORIGINAL request to the company that the device issue was related to the LCD screen, so they should have rejected my request and directed me elsewhere instead of sending a technician knowing he wouldn't be able to fix it and would charge me for the visit.",1123,138,139,0,"I preordered my Chronos on 5/24/16 from their website and was charged in full on that date. After numerous product delays, I finally received my Chronos on 11/21/16 (this is the date I consider my one year warranty to have commenced). The product worked, more or less, as advertised for 6 months; but...Â on 6/1/17 the back panel of the device fell off. This panel is not supposed to be removable and would not stay back in place, without this panel the device is uncomfortable to wear and will not charge. I immediately emailed Chronos Wearables and was very pleased when they responded in less than 30 minutes and sent me a return label. Approximately a week later I received a brand new Chronos device. Unfortunately, after using the new device for only 8 days the same thing happened. I emailed them on 6/17/17, and this time it took them 4 days to reply. In this reply dated 6/21/17 they did offer to replace my device and admitted to a known defect causing the back to fall off. ""Please rest assured we are actively working with our manufacturer to remedy this bottom plate defect as soon as possible as we definitely want to build a long-lasting product for our customers. It is certainly not our goal to further burden you with the task of receiving replacements repeatedly. To be completely transparent, we are noticing that some units in our current batch seems to be facing the same issue, which is definitely frustrating. We are awaiting a new shipment from our manufacturers in a few weeks which will ideally contain remedied units."" Although I was not entirely pleased that I would have to wait a few weeks for my replacement, the explanation of needing to wait for a new batch to be made without the known defect made sense. It ended up taking more than a few weeks and I sent a follow up email to which they replied they were still working on getting reliable and defect free units in stock. On 8/27/17, two months after my second defective device failed, I received a replacement unit. I was very surprised that after waiting for several months for a unit from the new batch with the defect remedied, that I was sent a refurbished unit. I understand that per the warranty this is an option, however I was led to believe I was waiting for a new unit. I emailed Chronos Wearables to express my dissatisfaction with receiving a refurbished unit and to ask specifically about the warranty conditions regarding the refurbished device. Over a week went by and I resent my email on 9/5/17, I never received a reply. This brings us to the present, where on 1/4/18 the back panel of my refurbished unit fell off. I sent Chronos Wearables an email on 1/4/18 and again on 1/10/18 and have not received a reply. It seems to me that this defect is a known design flaw and the delay in sending me the refurbished unit was a strategic and deliberate attempt to ensure that my warranty would expire before the back panel inevitably fell off again. If it was their intent to send me a refurbished unit, why did I need to wait for a new batch to be manufactured? I also find it suspicious that the refurbished unit arrived on a date that the 90-day warranty on the replacement and my original 1-year warranty would both expire at approximately the same time. The fact that a company that had always been very responsive, sometimes replying in under 30 minutes, is suddenly refusing to reply to multiple emails only strengthens my suspicion. If the two-month delay in which I was waiting for my second replacement and I was without the product in my possession is removed from the timeline, my one year warranty would still be in effect.",1124,139,140,0,"I had pre-ordered a Chronos smart disk back in December 2015.

Unfortunately, this is one of the latter reviews. I ordered a DAC and a set of cables from Sound Stage Direct (SSD); an order totaling nearly $740. Payment was made immediately via my PayPal account. The order was placed on a Sunday and showed online as 'processing'. A week later it was still 'processing' so I called Sound Stage and was greeted by their answering service, who took my contact information and order number, and said that SSD would call me back. After not hearing from SSD for a few days, I called again. Then again. And again. And again. Each time I reached SSD's answering service and I gave them the same information, which they said they would pass on to SSD. In addition, I emailed SSD directly and left messages via their website requesting an update on the order, but no one ever returned my calls or emails. After two weeks of trying to get an update, I sent a message via their website asking them to cancel my order. The very next day I received a call from Seth (the store owner) who apologized extensively, explaining that it was a perfect storm of people being on vacation, out sick and otherwise unavailable to return my calls. I accepted Seth's apology and he quickly shipped the DAC (the most expensive part of the order at $600), which I received a few days later. The DAC was exactly what I had ordered and all was good even if it did take three and a half weeks to get a product described as 'ships in 3-5 days' via UPS ground. But what about the rest of the order: the cables? After receiving the DAC I called SSD again regarding the cables. The call was immediately answered by Jim (suggesting that Seth's explanation regarding staffing challenges was valid; a good sign - or so I thought). Jim located my order and said he would call back later that day with an update regarding the cables. Needless to say, he did not call back that day or anytime during the next three days. I called again and Jim answered. He recalled my order and our conversation, and said that they would not be able to ship the cables until the following week. I said that this was not a problem and asked him to keep me updated, which he agreed to do. Two hours later I received an email from PayPal saying that my account had received a credit/refund from SSD for the cost of the cables. I went online to check the status of my order; it showed as 'cancelled'. No communication or explanation was received from SSD. Based on this experience, I am lead to believe that SSD is a business significantly smaller than it's website would suggest. They clearly have challenges stocking and supplying all of the items that they advertise on their website. This is not necessarily a problem if the customer knows and accepts this. However, when this is combined with disorganization in the way the business is run and a lack of transparency by their staff, then it is a problem. This lack or transparency, integrity and service results in a business who provides, at best, a 'hit and miss' experience. The service I received from SSD was unreliable and showed a fundamental lack of respect. Businesses like this are being driven 'out of business' by the likes of Amazon every day, which is one of the reasons I look to shop at places like SSD. But if they do not focus their attention on the customer experience, their customers will eventually turn to the Jeff Bezos' of the world - and they will have only themselves to blame.",1136,156,157,1,"Horrible.

Almost all orders say that they will be shipped within 2-4 business days, unless otherwise noted. My first order was placed on 1/31. It was still processing after 4 business days. I sent an email to the company that took more than 24 hours to respond to. They didn't explain why there was a delay, and said that they had everything ready and I should get a confirmation of shipment by the end of that day, and that they had expedited the shipping. I did get an email by the end of the day, but it hadn't shipped. It had just had a UPS label scanned and that it was ready for pick up from UPS. The estimated time of arrival is for 2/15.

Your store is organized and had a clean feel. I usually have a simple and successful time getting what I stop by to grab. But... I've got to tell you. I feel judged and scolded buying fish. And, this isn't something that just happened. Okay, it did happen yesterday. But it's also happened to my husband 1-2 other times while I was with him. Both of his experiences have been within the past year. Awhile back my husband went to bring home a beta fish, then a few weeks later he wanted a snail. My daughter and I stopped in yesterday to get her very own beta. She's 6. But, here's how the interaction goes. I'll start with yesterday... My daughter and I walk up to the employee in the fish department with a fish bowl and food in tow and say we want a goldfish. He asks if we wanted to put it in an open bowl. We said yes. He says he can't sell us a goldfish unless we put it in a tank with a pump. Surprised, I cite how as a college student I had a really cool black goldfish with big eye in an open bowl that lived a long while. He tells me it's actually inhumane. Trying to recover quickly, he suggests a beta fish saying it can be in an open bowl. My daughter being flexible, agrees. Then, we got to check out and I tell the cashier that as someone who works in communication every day there has to be a nicer way to coach and guide customers in their purchases instead of coming across as authoritative. I even suggest having a sign like ""Interested in buying a fish? We'd love to help you make sure you have everything you need to set up your ideal environment."" She said people don't read and says it depends on who I talk to in the store. I swallow my opinion and leave the store. But, here's the deal, Petco. If I owned a store and people had this kind of experience trying to buy things I wanted them to enjoy, I would be heart-broken if I lost a customer because they didn't feel like they could tell me or that I would listen. I do think it's important to treat animals humanely. I do think that people should be screened for having the right environment for their pet. The shelter my family got our rescue dachshund/poodle had a whole application for this and made sure we were aware of the grooming expenses for this breed. But... the conversation was a conversation. An educational conversation. NOT a conversation that made the employee sound like they were in control and I was an idiot for even considering putting a fish in a certain container. I don't keep up with the changes in how a goldfish is sold. It would have been a better experience if when I approached the employee about getting a fish for my daughter... who was standing just beside me... if the employee would ask if I preferred an open bowl fish. Upon saying yes, he could have made it a very magical experience for my daughter and said, ""Well, I'd love to introduce you to some really special fish that would love to live in that bowl."" Then... he could have walked us over and showed off the fish or at least said... ""Here they are... take a look."" So, here I am, begging you to really think about your employee training on communication. Your commercials and marketing are so happy and friendly. But, this customer's experience in your store doesn't line up. Thanks for listening.",1167,188,189,1,"I was in the Petco in Fairfield, OH the other morning, and I was looking at their small animals. A woman and her son, who looked to be about 3 years old, were looking at the animals, as well. An employee was assisting the woman and proceeded to take a Pac-Man frog out of its enclosure. I was no more than 3 feet away, so while she showed the frog to the other customer, I looked, too. Well, this dimwit employee, who has no business handling animals, was holding the frog on her open palm, making no effort to cup it in her hand or hold it securely. She then poked at it with her other hand, and to the surprise of no one, the frog tried to escape and fell at least 4Â’ to the bare concrete floor onto its head. Casually leaned down and retrieved the now dazed frog saying, Â“Ha, he doesnÂ’t care, he just thinks, Â‘IÂ’m free!Â’. I was speechless. She proceeded to hold the frog in the exact same manner and poke at it again, and the dumbass let the frog fall AGAIN!!! By this point, I was furious. I cannot comprehend the carelessness and nonchalance exhibited toward the welfare of an animal by someone in charge of looking after it, or how someone so stupid could be put in that position at all. Before I could bite my tongue, I muttered something along the lines of, Â“Jesus effing Christ!Â” I then quickly turned and walked a couple aisles away, as I was on the verge of losing my temper. I continued to watch as this twit went on showing animals to the woman and her kid. She took out a lizard next. I looked away for a moment and next thing I see is the employee on the floor reaching under the aquariums to retrieve the lizard and saying, Â“He canÂ’t go anywhere.Â” I donÂ’t know if this animal also fell to the floor, but it would appear that it did. Either way, it had escaped her, as well, and was in danger of being lost in the store. IÂ’m reporting this incident to their corporate office, but I have little faith that anything will be done. I learned from another employee that while Petco likes to preach about adopting animals as opposed to purchasing them from breeders, their own animals are purchased from breeders. The best part is that the animals are shipped like mail through the likes. One really must wonder if getting dropped on their heads is the worst thing to happen to these animals. Petco should be ashamed of letting such a careless and irresponsible person tend their animals, and for having hired her in the first place. Did not show the least bit of concern that the animals may have been hurt because of her and that seems to be right on par with the mentality of this corporation.",1168,189,190,1,I would like to give this business a 1 star.

Yes leave the dog for grooming. Petco made the decision that this dog was also a violent dog but rather have us take both dogs at the same time; they told us about one and had us leave the other.

Okay, she said that after she bathed my pup, he pooped and then rolled in it and had to rebate him. I suspect it happened in the drying crate. She probably left him there without any reassurance, and he probably got scared Shit, pardon the pun. When she told me she did not seem to be annoyed, but when she handed my pup over to me and I examined my pup, I knew she was! 1) She didn't shave his face and paws as I had requested. I told her and she said oh right, I forgot. I observed her from the window as she took the buzzer and began to work on his face, of course this being his first time, he was hesitant and resistant, Diana looked very annoyed and went back to get someone to hold him, she never introduced him to the sound and feeling of the buzzer prior to buzzing him, and she didn't do a good job of it, his muzzle was all uneven and I had to ask her to get under his chin as well. Still did a horrible job, my pup now has uneven hair on his muzzle, and it looked better before she touched it. She made it look worse. 2) She didn't even bother to clean his ears! I was shocked when I looked at them, heck if I was able to do it I wouldn't have brought him there. The chunks of hair inside his ears were not touched, and there was ear gook all over. She was on the phone and told the person she was talking to that she was almost done with this customer, to which I stated...no your not.... you didn't clean his ears...she replied once again, oh sorry I forgot. She stated she would take him in the back (the room with the mirrored door that you can't see into) for some unknown reason. A short time later she returned and told me to watch one ear because there was a lot of stuff in it and it had a slight order which could mean sign of infection, so much for the ""7-Point Pet Care Check"" which was not done automatically. Besides I have never been to a groomer that did not groom the ears! 3) When I got home, I noticed that she did not even clean his paw pads nor clip his nails! This was supposed to be part of the service, not to mention I asked her to shave his paws on top and she didn't do that either. 4) She did not clean his wee wee! Another thing I have never seen a groomer not do! I complained to the store and they offered me 15% off. Heck they should not have even charged me the extra $15.00 for the services that were not done at all or the ones that were not done properly.

My dog had been groomed several times at other businesses with no issue. I paid at 3:05 PM, and immediately after picking him up, at 3:09 PM, he urinated dark...red, nearly black, urine. I immediately took him to, the nearest emergency veterinary hospital. While end route to the ER, I contacted Doggie Style and spoke with the store's manager who informed me my 100 lb dog jumped from the bathtub while being groomed, but it didn't appear severe at the time. I was not informed of this at checkout, which is where I believe the dishonest business practices begin. I was told that the business uses their own, in-house veterinary service, but that it was not an emergency veterinarian. I stated my distress at the severity of the situation, and that I believed immediate emergency veterinary care was required. I was assured by the manager that if the veterinarian determines trauma to be the cause, they would handle veterinary expenses. On September 2, 2016, I mailed Doggie Style Pets pictures of my dog with the bloody urine timestamped 4 minutes after the time on my receipt from the store. I included a copy of my receipt, my dog's medical chart demonstrating bloody found in his bladder, with trauma as the diagnosis, and requested a full refund for the grooming service rendered at the store and reimbursement for the veterinary medical expenses that were previously promised. Over one month later, on October 17, 2016, the business owner, Howard, denied the previous claim that my dog jumped from the bath tub. I was also denied the full reimbursement that previously promised by the business and offered $220 in store credit. My dog received physical harm at this location and they could not pay me to bring him back, therefore the credit is absolutely useless to me. The business reneged on its promise to cover medical costs, which I believe to be dishonest.",1171,192,193,0,"Brought my cat for the 2nd time to this grooming place. I requested the lion cut grooming package which costs $75 which includes: nail trim, ears cleaned, wet or dry bath and a haircut. I also requested her teeth be brushed since I had a coupon. The staff called me 5 hours later that my cat is ready...Â to be picked up. Upon arrival I asked how she did because last time I brought her there she was calm and given a bath. No problems at all. The staff said she was trying to bite and scratch the groomers. I asked if she had her teeth brushed and they completely forgot. I asked if she got a bath. They said she didn't need one because she's clean. First of all, she hasn't had a bath in 8 months. only thing they did was give my cat this horrible cut that she looks like she's been skinned, and I do not recognize her. She looks like she has cancer or leprosy. I asked if they trimmed her back claws, cleaned her ears, gave her at least a dry bath and they said no because she was difficult to handle but they were able to do the most difficult thing which was cut and shave her WHOLE body. They charged me $81 for the whole package that originally costs $75 and they did not do any other service but did a terrible job on the haircut. If she was aggressive, their staff should've called me ASAP and I would've picked her up since I only live 5 mins away. She did not receive the most important service, which was a bath. Spoke with owner and she said she has to pay those two groomers. She then told me that I don't have hair from head to toe, I don't bite or scratch, so that's why they charge me the full price and an additional $6 which came out to a total of $81. This cost more than a woman's wash, cut and blow dry. my cat wasn't even washed. They could manage to shave her whole body but not be able to wrap her in a towel and trim her claws or clean her ears with a q-tip?? Doesn't make any sense.

I spoke with the business employees (maybe owners) Lana and Jen and they indicated the additional bills were an error and that my credit card would be refunded. My credit card was never credited and upon numerous emails and phone calls to correct this error and adjust my account, the error was never corrected. I ceased using Red Opal on 6/15/2017 because I was not receiving an adequate response. I'm hoping for a resolution of being credited for the dog walks that were never provided.

She was the typical liberal white black heart attack. So many American moms should have their license to be moms revoked. When I came into the store I was applying for a job. She became belligerent and committed disorderly conduct. If you want to save your life, do not trust those people Frankie. Food Lions employees and customers are insane. See mob scene from Frankenstein. I would shop at Giant on Centre Park Drive. The food is better. The selection is better. Some of the customer service employees are nice at Giant.

Because of the treatment and conduct of a cashier at Food Lion Store #1343, I felt it was necessary to write a complaint and give it to the Store Manager. Because of the convenient location, I continued to shop at this Food Lion store avoiding the checkout line where this cashier was working. I did not know that my written complaint was known by other Food Lion employees in this store. This became very clear recently when I was at the checkout line and a cashier treated me in a very disrespectful way. She seemed to especially have a problem with the bottle of wine I was purchasing because after placing all my groceries in a bag, she left the wine unbagged. I asked her to please put the wine in a bag. She told me in a very harsh voice to pay first. I did not know what to think. Was she questioning my ability to pay or did she have a problem with people purchasing alcohol? I paid as she told me. She then placed the wine in a bag while telling me in a sarcastic tone to ""have a blessed day."" I was dumbfounded as to why this cashier acted the way she did. On another day, I went back to this Food Lion store. I told a Food Lion customer service representative about what had occurred. I showed her my receipt which had the cashier's name on it. I was told that this cashier was there and I could just talk to her. I went over to this cashier and asked her why she treated me the way she did. This Food Lion employee started yelling and saying she was busy and did not have time to talk to me. I told her that I could have gone straight to the Store Manager instead of coming to her. This cashier told me to go ahead and go to the Manager. I then turned and went back to the Customer Service Desk. Before I could say anything, this cashier ran up to the service desk and said that I am the one who made a complaint against a Food Lion employee. I then knew why I had been treated with such animosity. It was because this cashier was retaliating against me because of the written complaint I had made. The Store Manager gave me a $15 Food Lion Gift Card as an apology for what happened. I will be using this Gift Card at another Food Lion store.",2179,202,203,0,"On Jan. 8, 2014, I picked up 2 packages of lunch meat (Oscar Meyer Deli Fresh) (ironic) at Food Lion #809 (3037 Legion Rd.

I gave him a Tylenol and had him take a shower. Before I knew it, he started vomiting profusely and had diarrhea. The only thing he had ate in the two hours he was home was the sandwich, so I checked the date on the lunch meat and sure enough it was expired (Jan. 2, 2014).

He is 4 years of age and I was denied to purchase the beer from the cashier. I demanded to speak to The Manager. He goes by the name of Scott. He informed me that I couldn't buy it since my son was present and it was up to him to sell it to me or not. I was very respectful and polite to him and I asked him for the corporate phone number which he replied that they were closed and that if I wanted to call corporate, I should google the number. After feeling very disrespected by Mr. Scott, I decided to call the police so that they can write a report and present it to an attorney to find out if my rights were violated.
When the police arrived, I was able to purchase the beer. My Wife also came to the store demanding answers from the manager but he refused to speak with my wife. I will not recommend this place to anybody. This manager thinks he can take the law into his own hands. Please stay away from this place. The customer service is the worst I had ever experienced.

She is a very good worker, shows up to work every day. She found out Friday she was going to have a baby. Went to her boss and told him. He took it upon his self to go tell other managers in the store. She was called stupid...and has been put down since then. I called in to the store and voiced my concern. Her boss, Nancy, was saying all kinda stuff, ""she should be married"", etc. I told her mind her own business. She told me ""now the drama will start."" The bosses are very rude to the people that work there...my daughter did not want the store to know about this until she went to the doc, but boy, news traveled real fast. Shame on them. Then today, she goes and someone tells her that ""they are going to hire someone else because you probably will not show up."" Her dog was sick, we took it to the vets, and this is what she hears today. I would like to know your privacy act. I do believe your bosses at the Hanover location broke it. I will no longer shop there or support a store that cannot treat their workers better than this. I know they are messing with my daughter and grand baby. My son worked there two years. He could not wait to found another job. They are so rude. There is plenty of people will back this up. You may call me. I would love to talk to management. She is so upset how she is being treated.

The clerk went to the office and left me standing for about 15 minutes before he returned with $10. A lady came out with him and said the video showed I loaded the groceries in my cart. I asked her if the video showed those items in any of the bags. She repeated that I loaded them in my cart; I still do not have the items I purchased. And if they erred in giving me my $10 change couldn't they have erred in bagging my frozen items? I told them I wouldn't be back. They said okay.

Two store employees were blocking the deli counter interacting and laughing as I tried to find a way to get around them and make it a quick trip. When I saw a sale placard for a ham brand on sale, I asked one of three ladies behind the deli case to supply me with a pound of the sale ham. The reply that I got was that they couldn't see the placard and would have to walk out from behind the case to see it even though she had me read it to her, in full, on two occasions. I was yelled at and reprimanded as she walked out and I simply had to stifle any remarks as this woman seemed to be looking for a public fight. I'd rather not be arrested for fighting back with a store employee even if defending myself. I left the counter to go after other items as this lady cut the ham, in order not to instigate any other altercations. I thought perhaps she had been joking with me or would apologize for her behavior but there was no such event, even upon picking up the sliced meat. I will never patronize this store again unless under dire circumstances. It was not just this particular young African American employee but others in the store were unwilling to move out of the way for me to see the deli case.

Then one man comes behind me with about three items. The checker of the express was involved with the other three chatting.

Rather than calling a manager as I requested, a checker tells me she is acting manager and that she will not exchange my milks purchased at another food for less for a different flavor because she can tell from the computer scan that the milk is a different price. There was an angry customer with many groceries in line behind me who asked her to check her out so she could leave. I once again asked her to speak to a store manager. The checker tells me that she is the acting manager. I asked her to give me the number to her corporate office and she tells me that she will call the manager. This is over a price difference in milk from a Food for Less one more exit over, less than a mile and 1/2 away. I know that for exchanges of items the price make no difference for an exchange, at least it hasn't the last couple of years I have shopped and worked for grocery and my mother has worked for grocery and my husband and every other time I have exchanged bad or wrong items. However, today this employee decides to act as if I am taking something from her personal pocket and she wants to play manager, until I ask for the corporate number. Meanwhile, my handicapped aunt is still sitting in the car waiting for me to get out and take her home with the sugar free milk. Scenario: Checker, whose name I neglected to get. She was about 5'6 with tattoos on her right forearm, black hair, medium length, she wore it pulled back in a mid length bun. I believe she is of Hispanic descent. I stood in the back of the line with three Califia milks and asked if she could call the store manager. She asked me what the problem was. She asked if I needed a price check. I told her I would like to speak with the acting manager. She told me to stay in line and she would help me. Background: Food for less on Imperial and Long Beach are out of stock on Califia toasted almond coconut milk 6/10/15. The milk was priced at $2.99. This is a dollar cheaper than the price I saw in Maywood at the Food For Less on Slauson and Pine Ave 6/09/15 $3.99 the morning before, and they were also out of stock. This time I asked an employee at the Imperial location to check in the back for me. After checking he found there was no more milk available, I asked for a rain check. He spoke to the lady who was ""acting manager"" or ""team..."" is what she calls herself. I have seen her there numerous times, tall, she wears a short, high bun in her hair, and wears it pulled back. The male employee who helped me told me that the manager said that rain checks are only given for things that are in the sell paper. I did not bother to check the sell paper to see if the milk was there because I have never personally seen Califia milk advertised in a sell paper. What is the deal with the customer service around these parts. When do the food for less in the area get the new stock in? Why are the prices different from Los Angeles to Lynwood. They are both poor areas.",2200,224,225,0,"As I was leaving Food 4 Less my cart locks on me right on the exit door hitting me hard on the front of my right leg. Right away I get the help of one of the cart guys and security guy as they are trying to unlock the cart and could unlock it they start dragging it out. Meanwhile I'm in pain lifting up my pant, I show them it's bruising and getting swollen. I ask the cart guy ""can I get a manager?"" He runs to help get him out. The manager comes out already piss off asking, ""Why it happen? Did you go through our registers because this normally doesn't happen,"" he try accusing me of a thief now. I ask ""can I get an ice pack?"" He said ""we don't provide any. I can get you some from the meat department. I ask ""let me file an incident report,"" he say ""we don't offer incident reports unless you ask for one.""
Then he runs back inside the store, brings me an icepack and says ""here you go and if something really happened here we have cameras on out entrance and exit door,"" well guess what good you tell me that this manager was a total punk. When he brought the icepack he thought I was just going to leave, so I said ""thanks for the ice supposedly you didn't have but I still want to file the incident report."" He's all mad say ""follow me."" I tried following as fast as I can but now I'm limping and lost him for a minute. Ok he comes back out, throws me the paper, and still has the nerve to say I don't have any witness. I said the security guard, he says ""no he doesn't count, he does not work for us."" The cart guy finally, he just gave me the cart guy's name, went home, called corporate office's managers at Food 4 Less, seriously need training on how to give good customer service.",2201,226,227,2,"I have been a customer for years buying from Roaman's Women's Clothing, and will no longer be a customer of theirs! Was told when I received a coupon code that I could use it on a specific item, even called twice to verify. Then when time to use it would not allow me to use it. The item was excluded from the sale, after waiting WEEKS to buy this item that was normally $179.99 they told me that some items are not in the sale. Well they need to train their customer service people on this, because even the morning of trying to buy the item the lady told me that it should be allowing it to discount the price, and even gave me another code that was expired and would not allow me to use that one.

Never will buy from them again. They don't appreciate their customers. This woman Melinda desired she wanted to argue with me like I'm some child. At this rate it won't be long before Roaman's is out of business. People don't put yourself through it. There are too many good online companies out there. I HATE this experience, and this company.

Ordered twice in July, both times the website froze up during the searching process, crashed, took FOREVER (customer service phone line backed up too). Took 2 HOURS (during a promotion) to place the 2nd order (about an hour for the 1st order). WOW, guess I REALLY wanted these items!! Tried multiple ways to order (my PC, cell phone, bla... bla). Outcome was the same. Because it kept freezing up, it changed the quantities and shipping info. Even when it looked like the info/changes had not gone through. Finally, I got everything ready to order, ordered, expedited shipping, so I could have for my high school reunion trip, and... it got worse. Even though I saved in cart, it froze up and popped me back to an earlier screen. WORST part was it changed the shipping preference back to the earliest preference, NOT the expedited I requested.",2204,229,230,2,"This company is deceptive in the way they do returns and exchanges. They offer a 30-day FREE exchange, however when I used the enclosed form and returned it with a formal dress requesting an exchange for a smaller size, they sent me an email saying that my RETURN had been received and they showed they have charged me $7.50 for shipping on my returned item. I wrote an email to their customer service email and never heard a word. So I went out and reordered the dress in the size I had requested in my exchange. The dress arrived and fit. My credit card had been credited for the differences and recharged.
A week goes by and I notice another charge on my account pending and receive another email from Roaman's stating that my order has shipped. I again reached out by email as there is not a telephone number to call and the number listed on the charge on my credit card goes directly to a Direct Marketing company. Long story short, the dress showed up yesterday, I am refusing the delivery and have reported Roaman's to my credit card company as a disputed charge. Loved the dress, but will never do business again with this company based the lack of customer service and inability to speak with customer service.",2205,230,231,2,"I bought some new clothes online from Roaman's catalogue for women. I just got the order yesterday. I did not open it until today. It was sealed in plastic and paper. Brand new. Well, I open the pants I got and noticed a smudge on the crotch.

So now here's the thing, I call them up and talked to customer service. I tell them there is this whatever (looks like you know what) in the pants. No blood... So she checks and says ""well, I am so sorry but we are sold out of that item in all sizes..."" I got angry and hung up... I called back and talked to someone else. He said they were totally out of the item as well. So he suggested they would give me a $7 refund on my card. Ok, so now I have to wash the item.

I was waiting for this sale to purchase 5 shirts in different colors just like the one I bought recently during a 40% off sale. The shirt I bought at 40% off was a better final price that the same shirt at 50% off! The only way that can happen is that the regular price was raised. It isn't the actual dollar amount that makes me so angry. It is the intentional lying and deception. Please carefully check the prices before taking out your credit card.

When I checked the status of my order it said it was just shipped from China. What??!! If I had known that I would have to wait at least a month for this order I never would have placed it. I am also questioning the quality of the items I will receive since they were made in China. I try to purchase products made in the USA.

Once I told them IÂ’d like my refund sent to my bank account because I no longer wish to do business with Zulily or order anything else from their website due to such an inconvenience, I was still told that IÂ’m being offered a courtesy store credit and that the name says what it is supposed to say.",2209,236,237,0,"In May, several orders were placed on my Zulily account that totaled over $1,000 within a span of a few hours. Since I have alerts set up on my accounts, I called both my credit card company and Zulily to advise them of the fraud. My credit card company cancelled my account and issued a new card. Zulily said they would cancel all transactions (which were addressed to Cypress TX - which should have set up a flag?) and they also closed my account. However, during the next billing cycle, Zulily charged my credit card for some of the items. I had to call my credit card company again and dispute the charges.
I called Zulily and they said that disputing the charges was the best route. My Credit Card company is going to take another week to investigate. While waiting on hold for Zulily, their policy is to take orders and then place the order with the vendor to make the items, so shipping is usually delayed for a few weeks. How did these items get expedited to ship the next day? Something doesn't seem quite right that I should have to keep beating back these fraudulent charges.",2210,237,238,1,"If I could give them 0 stars I would!! I ordered an Dusty Rose Maxi Dress for my pregnancy, when I received it I tried it on and it was nothing like the picture or what I was expecting.

I been e-mailing customer service for weeks and they did not resolve my problem, and they tell me the same thing that I have a store credit of $7.04?? I did not ask for store credit and never even wore this dress more than 1 minute to try it on. Right when I received it in the mail I sent it right back.
Customer service at Zulily is so crappy and do not help you. They did not explain the return or exchanges and when I read it before I purchased it said I could get my money with no hassle and easy returns which is a LIE!! They scammed me out of a purchase around $24 and kept the shipping for a re-stocking fee plus customer service said I can either get the $15.99 for the dress for store credit or only get the $7.04 back on my original payment method. Which is pretty messed up when I received an e-mail saying I would get it back from the original payment method. I e-mailed customer service saying I will never shop with them again.

I was traveling light and had brought a black and tan pair of Dressbarn pants knowing that I could mix and match for the week. Both pairs of pants shrunk causing me to take a cab to a local store and spend money purchasing new pants to get through the remainder of the conference. On 4/5/18, I called customer service to return or replace the pants. I explained that there was no indication on the tag that shrinkage may occur and was very disappointing that the product had let me down. I was read a scripted response from a call center employee and she was unwilling to deviate from her script to offer me any assistance. The return policy states that returns can be made within 60 days (I purchased them on Feb 19th) so, I am well within the 60 days however, because they had been worn and the tags removed, I was not able to return them. I asked for them to be replaced and again referring to her script, she was unable to help me. I asked to speak to a supervisor. The ""supervisor"" which come to find out was not, read the same script. I tried to have a reasonable conversation but it is hard when employees are scripted. After a very frustrating conversation, where I was told there were NO supervisors available ""because they are all in a meeting"", I was told that I was going to be put on hold ""probably for a long time"" while she waited for a supervisor, she was rude. Finally a woman named McKaila came on the line. She was not able to assist and made it clear that the call center does not have any authority to truly assist the customer. This is shameful, Dressbarn must empower their employees to provide customer service. It was very clear to me that this call center was nothing but an automated center in which the standard is NO. I will not support a company that does not care for the customer and employs low paid, low impact personnel to read scripts to people vs. talking to the customer and standing behind their products and service. This whole experience has shown me what kind of company Dressbarn is and I will make sure I inform my friends and network what a poorly run company this is.",2213,241,242,0,"I have purchased a lot of nice things from Dressbarn but found that a pair of pants I had bought were not going to work for me. I took them back to the store and explained to the person helping me that I had tried them on twice and realized I was not happy with them and wouldn't wear them. She had a distrustful attitude toward me from the get-go. The first thing she asked, in not a very nice way, was if I had worn them. I told her I had not. She then said she could not take them back because the tags were off. I had a receipt and I did not see how I could not return them if I had the receipt.
She then informed me that it was on the back of the receipt that the tags must be on the item. I told her it never occurred to me to read the back of my receipt and she informed me that was my contract!! I need a contract to buy a pair of pants!!? She picked up the pants again and said, ""you didn't wear these???"" I am not sure how I kept my cool but I did and after a long time and a lot of stalling and treating me like I was trying to pull something I did get my refund. After reading some of the other reviews I see that this kind of treatment is not an uncommon occurrence.",2214,242,243,2,"First let me say I don't shop anywhere else but Dressbarn, not anymore. I bought a pair of black crop pants. I wore them twice and I felt something weird and I noticed that the whole inside of the leg was shredding. I went back to the San Dimas store in CA. I picked up another pair just like it to do an exchange. The manager said (we don't take back damaged items). I said I only wore them twice and she repeated herself. I said ""I heard you might be closing"" and she said ""yes probably"" and then discarded me and walked away. I can tell you that I shopped there so much they knew my name. I am going to call corporate. What really made me angry was her disrespect for me. I spent $40.00 on these pants.",2215,243,244,2,"I have been a loyal and active customer of Dressbarn for almost 10 years. What happened today was the only bad experience I have ever had at Dressbarn. I have never had any problems with the store I shop at in Laurel, MD, but today was so surprising and made me rethink the value they place on customer relations.
I bought a top for my mum with couple of other garments and tried to return the top, which was NEVER worn (obviously so) with tags and receipt intact, only to be told that the return cannot be processed as it ""appears"" to have been worn because it smells. Customers try on garments in stores and I'm sure some wear heavy perfumes or have body odor. We normally just pick a clothing off the rack that we like. I did not know when it became a requirement for DB that customers smell clothes before buying otherwise they will be unable to return due to the smell of the garment. I find this preposterous as I was at a loss.
Bear in mind that it was even confirmed by customer service after calling to make a complaint that my record shows that I am a very active customer with little or no returns. I sometimes do exchanges only for size changes. I have a Credit Card with DB that I pay on time on, and even take visiting family members to shop there. Just within these past 2 weeks, my sister and mum made purchases to the tune of almost $500. It is so unfair to be looked in the face and told you did something you didn't do especially when your record even speaks for itself.
I definitely will no longer be shopping here again. I will pay off my credit card with DB ($180 or so) and close the card. I honestly do not want to have anything to do with a store that treats its loyal customers like trash. My mother still loves the store. That is the only store she gets all her garments from when she is town with me, which is rather unfortunate. I waited for over 30 minutes this morning for the store to open up and quite frankly, the store manager, who I believe did not do her job well, really messed up my day. She readily and gleefully gave me her name to call customer service. I guess it is because she probably knows the company's customer service wouldn't do anything, which was exactly what happened.",2216,244,245,2,"I've shopped at Dressbarn on various occasions in the stores, but in April I decided to order two dresses online through their website. I thought I was getting a deal when the shipping charges were free; however, it took three weeks for me to get the items. I bought items from two other stores through their websites at the same time; their shipping fees were also free; but I received those items within 7 days of order. Gladly I wasn't in any hurry for the items; however, I didn't like the dresses and had to return them. Here's where the problem began.
With the shipping return label that is provided there is no way to track the package further than post office, because that package is passed onto another shipping company and that tracking number is not available to you. I mailed the package back on May 1 and still have not received my refund. In contacting customer service, I was told it takes at least 30 days to receive a refund. Next week will be the thirty-day mark and I hope I to receive my refund by then. Regardless, I won't be using Dressbarn's online ordering system again.",2217,245,246,2,"This is my first time writing a review as to clothing. I thought I had finally found a store that had my style of clothing. This summer I purchased approximately 6-7 tops at DressBarn and I received many compliments on them. The problem is after a few washings the stitching around the neck, sleeves, hem, etc. started unraveling. Rather than pay extra money to a seamstress to repair the tops, I gave them to a thrift store and cut my losses. I had no receipts to return the tops to the store. My last purchase at DressBarn was skinny jeans, that I love, but I'm concerned the jeans may fall apart after a few washings. Sad to say, I doubt if I will buy any future clothing at DressBarn. It's too bad because I do love the styles but the quality is poor.",2218,246,247,2,"I purchased an item at Dressbarn that I decided not to keep and never even wore it. I went back the very next day to return the item. When I took the item out of the bag, I somehow lost the tags that were not attached any longer. I told the lady at the counter that they must have fallen out at home or in my car that I would look for them and bring them back. The lady said that they could not take them back because even if I found the tags, they were not still attached to the garment and it was policy not to take them back unless the tags were still attached. I explained to the lady that the tags had fallen off the item when I tried them on in the dressing room the day before and that the lady who cashed me out said it wasn't a problem and just scanned the price and threw the loose tags in the bag with the item.
This very rude lady then told me that all employees reattach the tags before a customer leaves so there is no problem with returns. I was so upset at this point! This rude person was basically calling me a liar! I again told her that the lady did NOT reattach the tags and that I walked out of the store with them like that. She pushed the item back at me and said she would not accept them without tags. I felt so disrespected as a customer. I drove all the way home and looked everywhere and of course I couldn't find them so I'm stuck with merchandise I will never use. At that point, however, I was more upset they treated me so badly.

When I got back home I went on live chat and ask why it was that way and they said PayPal is third party. I stated that they should have that on the web page and I was told they did. They provided me with the web address and I went to that site and could not find anything explaining that if you use PayPal you can only get store credit!

We had to wait outside because the benches inside were full. Our 10 minute wait time went into 20 minutes. I went in and asked about our table, the woman said she called our name. I asked her if she bothered to check outside, she said she didn't think to do that. Really? You have enough seats for maybe 6 people and at least 10 of us were waiting, where do you think we would be. Others were outside waiting as well.
She sat us in the bar area. After 10 minutes, our waitress named Rosa took our order. Waited 15 minutes for our food. Once the food came, we never saw Rosa again. She never checked back with us to see how our order was or to see if we needed anything else.

But, my son loves it, so I cave in now and then and go. The food and service was mediocre, as usual. I paid with my debit card on that little table top machine. Later that night my bank emailed me about 5 suspicious transactions on my account. Whoever got my debit card number wiped my bank account out. I didn't use my card any other place that day or the day before, so I have to assume the table top payment machine had a skimmer on it.
Fortunately, my bank is not holding me responsible for the charges and I will have my money back in my account in 5 business days. I called the manager of Chili's the next day to warn him about his tabletop payment machines. He refused to believe it could have been his machine. He said in the two years they have had those machines this has never happened. I can't prove that it happened at Chili's, but I don't know how else it could have happened.

There is not much selection on the menu. On our table, there was an electronic device that allows you to sign up to become a member, pay your bill and play games. While waiting for the food to arrive, I played a game. To my shock, they charge for this. I had no idea. Nothing was mentioned anywhere about there being a fee. I have seen little games at other places I had been to and there was never a fee. That was the final straw for me. I went there because someone gave me a gift card but as far as I am concerned, I won't be back.",2228,256,257,0,"Unfortunately the service at Chili's is inconsistent. I once a week ago and had a wonderful experience than this past Sunday. My daughter, mother and friend went and had a horrible experience. They went Sunday around 2 p.m. There was a female manager and a short waitress blonde hair who treated them terribly. The waitress overcharge them, double charge them, upcharge them without letting them know. When brought to her attention she made excuses and actually blamed them saying they probably touched something on the little kiosk that they keep on the tables. Instead of taking responsibility for her mistake and fixing it she had them wait there for an extensive amount of time and the manager didn't really seem to care. Very sad that the service is so inconsistent. This was the Chili's in Pennsylvania in the Tannersville area.",2229,257,258,2,"I went to Chili's (Diamond Bar, CA) last night with my son. I am already apprehensive about going there because the quality of the food and the service has gone way done in the past couple of years. We get seated and wait at least 5 or 10 minutes before our drinks even come out. We order and wait another good 20 - 25 minutes for the food. I ordered the sirloin steak, medium well. Well when I get it, it looks rather pale and almost as if it were boiled. No grill marks on it whatsoever. It didn't even look like a steak, it looked like a blob of putty on my plate. I go to cut into it and it is completely raw/rare. It starts to bleed all over my mashed potatoes and corn. I ate those right away and waited about 15 more minutes before my waitress ever came back to check on my food, by this time I am aggravated and grossed out. She finally comes over and I show her the steak and I tell her I can't eat it because it is way too bloody.
She takes it back to the kitchen, and she did ask me if I wanted a soup or salad while I waited but I declined. I just wanted my steak and to get out of there. It finally arrives about another 5 or 10 minutes later and they ask me to cut into it to see if it is cooked correctly. It was, but it was the toughest, rubberiest, chewiest steak I have ever eaten. I chewed certain pieces for what seemed like 2 or 3 minutes until I finally spit them out into my napkin. What a huge disappointment in the steak. And I've been disappointed by their steaks before so I kind of kick myself in the butt for even ordering them and trying to give them another chance. I don 't know what's going on with Chili's lately but my last 5 trips, at least, have been substandard. Seriously not going back anytime soon. Maybe ever.",2230,258,259,0,"We were at Chili's Khalidiyah Mall last Friday 19th Jan 2018 and it was really a BAD experience. We asked for New York Steak and it came as if it is BOILED, no taste, no herbs, no salt. The mashed potato was as if it is the leftover collected. We asked for the sauce. They said, ""You will need to pay for sauce!!"" We asked for the standard steak sauce in bottle. They said, ""Sorry not available."" My husband went to the manager at the branch asking for money refund as we didnÂ’t see any value and he didnÂ’t eat his meal as the food was really awful, she said, ""Sorry we can't. We can change only."" Neither the waiter nor the manager cared about people's satisfaction and it is really bad to see the Quality of Chili's declining that way.",2231,259,260,2,"On this day December 16, 2017 I went for a visit at Chili's with my daughters to relax out and it was the worst experience ever. First of all when we arrived we were seated fast then the waiter was Bobby came to the table, introduced himself and asked if we were ready to order. We stated, Â“Give us a minuteÂ” but we ordered the drinks. He brought the drinks without the straws so we then asked him for the straws. He passed our table at least 4 times going other places for other customers and then next he brought our appetizers out which didn't bring our straws nor silverware out and then he said, Â“Huh I need to get silverware and straws?Â” We were just sitting there waiting all that time and then he came back with the stuff and few minutes later here he come with our meals which we were trying to finish the appetizers and the meal just sitting losing temperature.
We ate our food. He wasn't acting like he wanted to be bothered with us really. I almost just walked out of the place. I was so unhappy. Finally he came and we were ready to pay so I handed him my gift card and cash. Well I knew I last had 22.18 left on my card so she, he came back I asked him to see a receipt because I didn't feel the amount of change wasn't right so he mumbled again. Hmmm when he came back he said, Â“You had 11.08 on your card.Â” So my change was 2.12 which he still didn't leave the 12 cents which at that time I was feed up with him and the point of it all is that everything was just horrible. One thing after the other and I surely don't want to visit again just poor customer service and I am a Nutrition Manager and we serve the same way at our facility in course so I know the ropes that place need a major turnaround if the staff all work that way.",2232,260,261,0,"I tried Chili's for the first time with my daughter. We were sat next to a booth that was closed off with buckets beside it to catch water from a leaky roof... Nasty! We both order Fajitas and a appetizer. We requested the app have the guacamole removed, it was still put on there. Her meal came out first and was very charred and missing the pico from the beans. I had to wait 10 mins for mine. When mine finally arrived, there were no limes with it. The server suggested I use the limes from my drink, and I quote ""take it from your drink"" with a smile she said. This was the worst experience ever! I did speak with the manager Zack. He said he would speak with the server and apologized and offered to send Gift Cards to cover our next meal.

I will also write another review as well with that experience.",2233,263,264,0,"We sat down and three other groups were seated after us but ordered before us!

We ordered the two pancakes, hash browns, two eggs over medium, and the two biscuits as shown on website build your own slam.

She stated air has been out for 2 months. This makes no sense. Customer & employees are uncomfortable. I really donÂ’t think corporate cares about anything but making money. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but this really messes with the morale of employees. They are hot and irritated. Come on. Really!!! I was told employees and customers have been complaining for the past 2 months and nothing has been done.
I placed a call to corporate to speak with someone. The person that handles complaints was out to lunch. Her name is Gabby. I provided receptionist my name and call back number. If I donÂ’t receive a call before end of day I will be calling back until this is taken care of...

One burger that is not cooked to order, being that they do not ask how you want the meat cooked, was just under 11.00 dollars. I tried to get a ""new"" featured burger, which in the picture on the menu showed bacon cheddar tots. Well, the joke's on you should you order it as the picture depicts. It is an upcharge for these 6 tiny bacon cheddar tots. Even more irksome, was when the order was placed, the server did not care to let me know about such an upcharge. I requested that the burger not have caramelized onions, tomatoes, or pickles, but suffice it to say, this did not decrease the cost of the burger.
The server and the cook did do the order as requested, however I ate the entirety of the meal, but was not asked whether or not I was enjoying it while eating it. I received the receipt, then found the aforementioned upcharge on the meal. I said this wasn't right and felt as though such dishonesty is the same as stealing. The server shrugged and apologized. This did not mitigate the price listed on the bill. After taxes, it was over 12.00 U. S. dollars. I decided to decline leaving a tip. This is very atypical for me, however, with the rumored raises serving staff has gotten, not by my choice, I no longer feel it prudent to add to it with a tip. Particularly after this kind of service was given. If a large company like this chose to grant such raises, should the consumer be picking up the tab with overpriced menu items? This of course is a rhetorical question.",2236,266,267,0,My family have always went Denny's on payday. We never had a lot of problem with this restaurants. But we had one waiter take our drink but we didn't get them until about twenty mins until a another waiter walked in and then we got our drink. The second waiter took our orders since the first one (Brittany) didn't give our drinks or even take our order. And then once we got our food my daughter had to eat with her hands bc there was no forks or nothing giving to us. And we had to asked the waiter in the pink shirt two times to bring us some... But the good news the food was great. But next I just going to see if Amber or Hannah I think the second girl name is at works. Becasue our family wouldn't of been treating like this at all.

The waiter never refilled our drinks until we had to ask him, he kept telling us that we couldn't do certain things to our order because he wasn't allowed, and he overcharged us on drinks. We go to check out and the manager tells us that we don't qualify for the kids eat free that are from 4 to 10 when I tried to explain it to her that we order the same thing weekly and never had this problem.

Instead of having a hostess seat us we had to wait in line to put in our order. We were then given a number and chose a table. The employee came to our table and gave us silverware and then when the order was ready brought to our table. She also took our dishes when we were done. My granddaughter who is 10 years old didnÂ’t like the way it was done also as we have been a customer many times when a kiosk was on the table and we put our own orders in with the waitress.
We noticed that there were only 4 other groups there and we were used to having a large number of groups at the tables. We left a tip for the employee and asked if she was getting any tips this way and she said sometimes she does and sometimes not. We feel this new way isnÂ’t very friendly and certainly not good for the waitress since this probably is her livelihood.

There appeared to be only one waitress working. Our silverware was dirty with old food stuck on it. I ordered a garden veggie omelet without mushrooms. It came back with mushrooms on it and in it and I sent it back. I then got back my same omelet that was reheated (no garnish on top as I had removed it as it included mushrooms). I opened the omelet and it still had some of the mushrooms in it. I sent it back and said I didn't want any food replacement! My friends had finished eating at this point. One of my friend's eggs were rubbery and my others friend's bacon (ordered extra crispy) was rubbery. The manager was kind enough to take my meal and my coffee off our order. Haha.

I usually go to Friendly's with my 4 grandchildren, daughter and son in law and husband and everything is usually okay. We went for the $2 quarter pounder burgers and fountain drinks. The waitress was nice and tried, but the experience was terrible.
We ordered 4 $2 burgers. We were told $.99 for French fries, $1.99 for waffle fries and $2.49 for a salad. My husband and friend ordered the salad. My friend and I ordered the fries. The waitress came back and said the salad would be $3.69. My husband and my friend changed to fries. We ordered 1 diet coke and 2 lemonades. I order iced tea and was told that is not included. We got square hamburgers that were not quarter pounders and no taste. We then ordered dessert. The bill came and the fries were now $1.99 each. We told the waitress and she said they changed the price. They would not take it off the bill. When we left, the sign said iced tea was included. I am totally upset about the entire situation.",2241,273,274,1,"I can't believe this place still has franchises open. It is absolutely horrible. Friendly's??? How about unorganized, terribly managed and unfairly priced. I watched our waitress seat people, including us, take orders at about 10 tables, run food to tables that were not hers and her own, buss and clean tables (hers and not hers), she said she would be back with our ice creams after SHE had to make them and I even think she had to go in the kitchen and make some of her own food for her tables. Meanwhile, I never saw a manager until this big blond lady came out of the back to use the bathroom.
She went past a table and grabbed a credit card receipt and handed it to our waitress while she was talking to us and said ""make sure you close this out as soon as possible"". I don't know what that really means but our poor waitress is literally running this restaurant and I'm assuming the manager only wants $ or has some kind of quota. What a lazy piece of crap! She could of grabbed a dirty glass or threw away the napkins but NO! Needless to say our waitress was great considering her endless duties. I feel bad for the people that work there. Not to mention, the food sucks!!! 10 for a burger with nasty cold fries. I've had better in a hospital. This place sucks and their management should be ashamed of themselves. You will go down. Hopefully soon.",2242,274,275,0,"My family and I went to Friendly's Restaurant in Norwood, MA recently and had a terrible experience in almost every way. First, it took about 15-20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and come take our drink order. When I asked a waitress about it, the waitress was very rude and unfriendly. The funny thing is that it was lunch time, but there were not too many people in the restaurant that day at all. My family was already complaining about how Friendly's was notoriously slow, but this visit was ridiculous. We waited about 1 hour for our food (4 people all simple orders), and again, not super busy. The waitress did not visit the table even once during that time and did not appear to have any people skills or friendliness skills, ironically. She didn't come once in the entire meal to ask us about drink refills. She seemed bothered to even stop by.
We go out a lot to different restaurants, and this was one of the worst experiences we have had, if not the worst in a long time. The worst waitress we have had too. When the food finally did arrive, it was wrong on multiple accounts. I ordered the crispy chicken breast sandwich, and what I received were three sad chicken fingers on a hamburger bun. I called back the waitress and asked her about it, and she said they ran out of the crispy grilled chicken. Frustrated, I said, ""Oh, Really? So, you just give me chicken fingers without telling me you ran out of my meal and without informing me that you were giving me something else? If I wanted chicken fingers, I would have ordered them..."" To me, this was the antithesis of not caring.
Next, my wife ordered the Chicken Bacon Ranch salad with grilled chicken. It was missing the tortilla chips. It was missing the egg. It came with crispy chicken instead of grilled. And, it was the saddest looking salad I've even seen bar none; and this is coming from someone who worked in restaurants for nearly 10 years. There is more, but I think everyone gets the point and would agree that there was no excuse for this disastrous kind of service. So unfriendly. So not interested in serving us. So unprofessional. And, sooo long of a wait for absolutely no reason.
I thought the service was bad. Apparently, it wasn't as bad as Friendly's management who never even responded to this letter I send them, which is why I'm putting it here. Chipotle responded to my high praises of them the next day and to a recent complaint the same day. That is a business. Friendly's has become a disaster.

They included an invoice from Safelite auto glass for $874.90 - when I obtained a quote for cash from Safelite - it was for $310.00. National then added their own ""fees"" to this as well. Everything about this screams scam and ripoff.
When you rent a vehicle you are told to report everything larger than a quarter. This chip (not a star) was less than 1/2"" in length, and it was not in the driver's line of sight.

Rental car companies can hit consumers false, and possibly fraudulent claims based on their word against yours as to whether the damage was there before you picked up the vehicle.

We started having problems with this car burning oil, rattling and not wanting to pick up speed going uphill in March and we called them about it. They told us to take it into their service department and have them look at it. That's what we did and all they did was top it off with oil. Then in May, we were there again twice for the same thing and again on June 29th. For the same thing, they did the same thing again and sent us on our way and told us that we would need to bring it back. But before we could do that, the car put us down not too long after we left there. We had to have the car towed into their service department over at Southlake and that is were the car is still. When we got the car, the car had a warranty on it for 90 days 3000 miles and we had 2000 more miles to go before the warranty was up. I think about 3 more days.

They called today, July 5th, 12PM, telling me that the warranty has ran out and we will have to pay $3,100 to have the motor replaced in the car because that is the problem.

This company needs to be put out of business and not be able to sell any more cars.",2256,290,291,1,"I only had $500.00, and I also had a 1999 Volkswagen Passat that I had to trade in because of the cost of maintenance for it. I don't know what I was thinking. I needed a reliable car, and I thought I could get one from them. I was there for 8 hours. I qualified for this 2003 Impala, in which they initially stated that the monthly payments would be $390.00 per month. I had enough sense to know that was ridiculous, and I talked them down to $315.00 after four hours.
After driving the car for about a month, it began to slip very often. I took the car to the Chevy Dealer for a diagnostic test, before my warranty ran out, and received paperwork stating that the transmission and the engine was bad. They told me that the car was no good. They looked at me in pity, as if they knew how crooked Pars Cars was. So I took the car back, and showed them the paperwork. Pars Cars stated that they couldnÂ’t go by the paperwork and had to do their own diagnostic test and that it will cost me $95.00. So I had to pay them for the diagnostic test. How crazy is that? So I was just waiting for them to disagree with the Chevy DealershipÂ’s diagnostic results, but they agreed that the engine and transmission was going bad. Maybe it was because I said if they don't give me another car, I will leave that car there. Not that another car would be any better.
So they said I qualified for a 2002 Honda Accord with 150,000 miles. The payment for this car was much higher, $350.00, and I had to spend four hours again talking them down to $315.00. One of the sales manager's spoke with such professional ""crooked persuasion"". He just kept saying, ""Oh you have a great car here""! I knew that I made a bad decision going to that place. After a couple of months, the Honda began slipping, the D4 light was blinking on and off, and the car was idling to 4-5k. I took the car to several places to get it fixed, replaced all the mounts, the head gasket, water pump, and other things that I have paperwork on. I went to Mr. Transmission in Riverdale, GA, and was advised that the transmission is bad. He said that it would cost about $1700 to repair the vehicle. This is money that I don't have. So they gave me another lemon! My interest rate is about 28%. I owe about $23,000 on the car and if I paid it off with cash, it would cost $12,000.
I didn't really know what I was getting into. I just knew that I needed a reliable car. There's nothing reliable about Pars Cars! So this car is going back! It's not worth the crazy headache, that it has been costing me. Now everybody tells me, ""I could've told you not to go there"". ""Everybody knows their crooked as hell""! I'm a single parent, with two kids, struggling enough. They do ** so slick, you don't even know what hits you, if you're not hipped to the game! I will never recommend anybody to go there ever. And if they try to throw paperwork at me to go to court, I have my paperwork too! And I will use the $$$$ that I save from taking this junk car back, to pay for an attorney! I know that we live and we learn. This place definitely helped to open my eyes. ItÂ’s sad what people will do for money.",2257,291,292,1,"I purchased a used 2000 Ford Escort from Pars Cars in Morrow and the car did not last 6 months. The car had a bad engine. I paid full in cash for the car. The customer service I received was awful. I had to put the car in the shop twice, at Pars Cars dealership. The first time, I had to pay them $600. The 2nd time, they asked for an additional $2400. I refused to pay. The car is still sitting on their lot. Do not buy from this company!",2258,292,293,0,"I purchased a used vehicle from Pars Cars on 4/29/09. I was not aware of Georgia's lack of lemon laws until I heard it repeated to me several times after they took my money. But Pars CarsÂ’ claim is that they will put credit challenged individuals in safe, reliable vehicles while you are making affordable payments while rebuilding your credit. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I sit here writing this complaint, I have spent $1,267.39 in repairs while still making $350.85 monthly payments. It started with the ABS light, then the ball joints, then fuel pan leaking, then the tire rods. Now, we are back to the ball joints again because they were not installed correctly by Pars Cars.
Due to the amount of money I had to be paying to repair the vehicle, I communicated with the credit department that my first couple payments would not be on time and was granted extensions; however, I was not aware that I was accessing late fees for those months. I went on to make my payments and was never told about the fees until September when United Auto Acceptance debited my account without my authorization for an amount that exceeded my payment amount. When I tried to use my debit card and it declined, I was notified that they had debited my account twice totaling over $900.00 and sent my account into overdraft because I had other charges pending in addition to a money order I had already purchased for the car payment.
I have been paying with money orders for the past few months. I notified Carol of UAA that I would be sending the payment on 12/7/09, and I did. On 12/9/09, I took the car in for the ball joints inspection, and after making the arrangements to do the repairs, and as I was getting ready to pick up the vehicle, I was advised by Ms. **, the Credit Manager, that the vehicle will not be released until the full payment is received. I offered to bring my portion of the money order as proof of payment, and she refused and claimed I owed $421.07 and that is what I would need to get the vehicle back today. I have been paying an average of over $300.00 for repairs on this vehicle every other month. The late fees are $70.16; that is nothing compared to $300.00.
When I expressed to her that I have no other means of transportation and I need the vehicle to go to work, her response (while eating) was she needs my account to be current for me to get the vehicle. When I questioned as to why I was charged late fees when UAA agreed to give me an extension, she became nasty and asked me what did I expect when I purchased such an old vehicle. She went on to emphasize the year and make of the vehicle. Doing business with Pars Cars/United Auto Acceptance has been a nightmare. I did not pick this vehicle. After they took my deposit, I was basically led to the vehicle and told that is what I was qualified for. Please help me.",2259,293,294,1,"Newark, NJ - Rented a car from them several weeks ago now, purchased the EZ Pass thinking it would save me time and be worth the money. Had a charge several weeks later for the tolls. Okay no problem $50 plus dollars worth of tolls seemed a little much but okay I'll pay it. Then receive another fee of $60 plus dollars several days later with no explanation to what it could be. When I call Enterprise (can't get a hold of the exact location; how convenient). I talk with customer service they say they can't tell me what the fee is exactly for but it's a cleaning fee for the car. $60 plus dollars?! She asked if I smoked in the car? No I don't smoke. Did I have a pet? No was on vacation; didn't even eat in the car and yeah thought it was taken care of when they looked over the car with me. I mean they gave me a receipt that says no discrepancies... so she says she has to contact them and they will give me call to talk about it. It's been over a week and haven't heard anything? 2 days later I get another $20 dollar toll charge? As if $50 wasn't enough. Now I want a list of the tolls I went through; how much each cost. The details would be real helpful but you can't get a hold of them no matter how many messages you leave. Really great customer service too. They all act like well it wasn't them that made the charge. So funny enough started working with an ex-employee of Enterprise recently and they told me a lot about how sketchy they are and how much they're pushed to tack on as much fees as they can get away with. Honestly completely unsatisfied with this company's behaviour. It's absurd you share your private information with them and they think they can get away with adding themselves to some type of payroll without your consent. Super dodgy people that are inconsiderate about wasting your time. Probably just want you to give up trying to get these absurd charges back.",2260,294,295,1,"Hello, I would like to leave negative stars if it would allow me too. I have been with Enterprise for the past 4 years and a platinum member all four years. Not only will I not ever use Enterprise again due to this location and the location at the Houston Bush location, but I will spread the word on the horrific experience I experienced and the negligence of Enterprise taking care of the situation. It's been over week since this incident happened and I can not even get a hold of the branch manager or district manager. Several messages and emails has been sent.
I had to use the Enterprise road service and needed my car towed. They told me that they could not tow it back to Hobby, and that I needed to get towed to Bush airport. I said that was fine. This was a 50 minute trip. But instead it turned to a three hour trip. I was first taken to Buckeyes for him to use the restroom. That was okay till we stopped to talked to another tow truck driver (not the same company) for 20 minutes and not using language you would use in from of a customer.
After getting on the road he tells me, ""Oh ** my tires are flat."" We just left a gas station that had air. I said, ""Okay what now."" He said we need to fill them up. After driving for 15 minutes we pull into a neighborhood. At this point in time I am very scared and nervous and tried to remain calm. He parks and goes into a house. I send my family my location and tell them the situation. I am not from Texas and this made my family nervous and I was not sure really what to do.
I literally froze. My tow truck driver then gets back into the truck after going into the house for a few minutes. He states all better. I said, ""The tires?"" He said yes. I did not want to cause him to get upset so I said, ""Please take me straight to the airport."" He said okay. I may not be the brightest when it comes to cars, but I know going into a house will not inflate tires. After driving for an hour and 20 minutes, we pull into another gas station and he looks at his phone and says,""Oh my god we have been going the wrong way."" I told him that I was very nervous and need to know if I need to get out and Uber. He said, ""No the airport is half an hour away."" We then get to the place that he needs to drop the car off and he leaves the car and finally drops me off on the ramp to get to the car rental.
I explained my situation to the employees at Bush, the attendant taking care of me apologized and said, ""Geeze I hope we get our car."" I said, ""Oh yea you got it. It's about 5 minutes from here."" He said, ""Wait he took you there too."" I said yes. Obviously he was not supposed to take me there either. The gentleman that was checking me into my car told his manager what happened and he did not seem to care at all how horrified I was. I told him, ""Look you can look at the GPS tracker in his truck and get all the locations and stops that we made."" I told him that you can see that the pick up is 50 minutes from here and not 3 hours.
The next day I told the branch assistant manager of Hobby and I was told that the manager would call me. After 2 days the manager did call me, left me a voicemail with a number that no one ever answers. I have emailed him asking him to please call me over a week ago. I have called the customer service line and have left a message for both the Branch manager and District manager to call me back and here we are a week later and nothing. They obviously do not care about their customers or the fact that they have experience a terrifying experience.",2261,295,296,1,"This is a review of Enterprise Rental Car Company, specifically in Kirkland, Washington. I was tasked with a job of driving the shuttle bus I normally drive for work to a location in Kirkland, Washington to have a new paint job done for a rebranding of the location I drive the bus for. It was arranged in advance by my employer to have a rental car reserved so that I might get back to Bellingham, Washington to retrieve my car and get home. When I called the Enterprise location to get picked up, I was put on hold for a couple minutes, while on hold I listened to the recorded advertisement for the company, which repeated over and over, with the main theme being Â“we pick you upÂ”Â…Â”relax and leave it all to usÂ”.
When the agent came back on the line I explained who I was and that I was calling to get picked up, he then informed me that they donÂ’t actually do that on Saturdays, as they are understaffed and too busy. I explained that my employer had arranged this rental car specifically because I would need to be picked up from the shop where the bus was to be painted. I also explained that I had no other form of transport to get to them to get the car. At that point the agent relented and said they would pick me up.
Once he had and had brought me back to their office, another agent Â“the managerÂ” asked for my driverÂ’s license which I provided to him. He entered it into the computer and then announced that I was on the Â“do not rent to listÂ”, I asked what was he talking about and he said I had an outstanding balance with Enterprise from 2011 and that they would not be able to rent to me until that was paid. I had rented a vehicle in 2011 and had prepaid for the rental IN FULL. I never received any additional bill in the mail, never received a phone call, never had anything appear on my credit report, and was never contacted by collection of any kind. All of which I told him, and he said I would have to take that up with his corporate office which would be open on Monday (this was Saturday).
The actual rental was being procured by my employer who is a nationwide company and the billing information had been provided by my employer, I was only listed as the driver of the vehicle. This did not matter to these agents in this Kirkland office, they reiterated that I would have to pay my balance before they would Â“rent me the carÂ”.
I was now stuck 90 miles from my home. Attempts were made to obtain another car from other rental car companies in the area, but there were none available. So while all of the options of transport for me to get home were being exhausted and subsequently another employee of the company had to drive down from Bellingham, 90 miles to pick me up and return to me my vehicle and home. This all took 6 hours, 3 of which I spent in the parking lot of Enterprise where I was told to move twice by the manager to smoke a cigarette, ending up across the parking lot, and the office closed while I waited in the parking lot, all without another word to me. I strongly advise anyone contemplating using Enterprise Car Rental to NOT. Find someone else to give your business to.",2262,296,297,1,"I had a car rental because I was in an accident.

When I got my car back in May 2017, I returned the rental. In Aug, 1 day apart, both the auto body shop and my bank acct was charged. Enterprise received payment twice for 1 account.

When I arrived I was told that there were absolutely no cars available and I should just come back at 9 am the following day when there ""should"" be some cars available. Am I expecting too much, that if I make a booking on their website and even call first for confirmation, that a booking should not go through or be accepted if the car(s) is not available? Is that too much to ask? I really felt that the situation was treated with such a cavalier attitude.

Just shocking!",2264,298,299,1,"I didn't rent a car from Enterprise, my parked car was hit by an Enterprise Rent-A-Car driver who purchased supplemental insurance. I've been waiting three months and RIS, the rental insurance services company in Tempe, AZ, refuses to pay citing they don't have enough information--not sure it's covered and a host of other reasons. Story: My car was parked in a residential neighborhood in LA three months ago. This woman who rented a Toyota from Enterprise in Beverly Hills and purchased the supplemental insurance hit my parked car and another parked car on a Sunday @ 2:00 a.m. How do I know? There were police reports on his car and mine. My car was towed later in the morning to my mechanic. I called Enterprise, reported it. Submitted BOTH police reports, pictures of my car, tow truck bill and my mechanic's bill. According to Enterprise in Beverly Hills all is good because the driver purchased their supplemental insurance.
Enterprise's Liability rep. Jaclyn says not so fast. Not sure it's covered etc. I called the Insurance Commissioner of California. Enterprise is a private company--I can sue the driver in small claims, if I win (She said how could I not) Enterprise would have to pay my court fees and the claim. Meantime, I can't get this rep to talk to me and Enterprise is ignoring me. Because the damage is not enough, I can't get an attorney. Enterprise knows this which is why they're playing this game. I travel for work and will no longer use Enterprise for a car rental. If you HAVE to rent from Enterprise, use a credit card and say NO to any of the insurance options. The Salespeople make commission on selling it to you and there are NO guarantees you will be protected from purchasing it.",2265,299,300,1,"When I rented from Enterprise I used a debit Visa Card and the website let me reserve the car.

So I put down the deposit. When I returned the Car I was then only then told that the deposit couldn't be reversed and a check would have to be mailed to me. I said that!

See this is a true sign of a Sociopath, make the other person feel even though you made all this happen! Jamie should be fired and charged with theft!

I have resulted in having severe face pain and numbness on above my ears all the way down around my jaw, up to the other side of my temple as having no feeling whatsoever except the horrible tingling so it is painful all of the time. If there is a class action lawsuit against this Lifestyle facelift I would love to be a part of it. Please let me know.",2274,310,311,1,"Without a doubt the worse decision I have ever made. I had watched the infomercial on this procedure over and over and it sounded so good, I finally made the call and set up an appointment for my consultation. Everything seemed fine and I felt good about the procedure. On the morning of my procedure I was very calm and relaxed, not scared at all. Even the nurse who took my vitals made a comment on how calm I was. I was given 20 mg of and put in a room to relax. When I was good and sleepy they came in to start the procedure. Well there is no stimulus like pain. I chose to have the fat pockets removed from under my eyes. It felt like pure fire in my eyes. I could not be still and my surgeon became very upset with me. When my blood pressure shot up they gave me 10 mg more of and went to the lobby and told my husband they were having a little problem with my blood pressure. When the procedure was finally over, they wheeled me to my car and sent me home with 30 mg of in my system. Look up, 2 mg is a huge dose.

They did some lipo and lifted my chin-somewhat. The results were minimal and lasted only a few months. The trade-off? They DISFIGURED my ears. I have no lobe and where there was a lobe it is now attached to my face. For years there was considerable scarring in front of and behind my ears. Thankfully the scarring diminished about 5 years after the surgery. My temples had a lump on each side where it appears they bunched up skin. It took years for the lump on my right temple to diminish to the point of nearly invisible but the lump on left side of my face is still there. For years I have also had a lump in front of my ears. It is more pronounced on one ear than the other. It appears that is were they gathered skin and just sewed it up.
I never went back to ""fix issues"" because clearly they have proven their incompetence the first time around so why would I risk further disfigurement? After seeing numerous disaster plastic surgeries from Lifestyle Lift and other surgeons around the country to include those that do surgery on celebrities which are known to pay millions, I have come to the conclusion that 90% of plastic surgeons are incompetent and only in it for the money. They couldn't care less if they disfigure someone. In spite of it all, I consider myself one of the lucky ones. My disfigurement is nowhere near as bad as others I have seen online compliments of Lifestyle Lift.
My belief now is that facial/chin plastic surgery should only be done on someone whose face is already disfigured as a result of accident or illness and surgery is done to eliminate or alleviate that disfigurement not for the purposes of eliminating wrinkles or sagging skin. There are better, safer non-invasive procedures these days that can eliminate or reduce wrinkles and sagging skin in face and neck. If I could go back in time I would have NEVER EVER done this procedure. Ever since this surgery I have little faith in Doctors in general and avoid them like the plague. I do my research and look for alternatives if I have to have a procedure done. Please please please do not do this! The amount of ""successes"" are small compared to the failure rate.

On November 12, 2012, I returned to the clinic to report my disappointment with the outcome of the neck lift procedure and was told by the nurse no doctor again, that yes there was a problem, the results of the procedure were not what they told me they would be and they would correct the problem at a reduced cost.
At that time they scheduled me for a return appointment which they later cancelled. I tried many times to contact the office to reschedule an appointment and I was always put on hold and could never get through to talk with anyone in the office. I am disappointed and dissatisfied with the outcome of my neck lift and even though I attempted to have my situation corrected I was never able to do so.

After healing, my face had deeper lines and scars, my face fell drooping and neck was very loose and I can still feel pulling from my ears down the side of my face with expressions and eating when doing this the skin puckers up. I look older than before. I have a huge scar under chin and behind my ears looks chewed up. I had problems healing under chin and ears, I had bleeding and oozing behind my ears for about a month after stitches were removed.
After calling their office I was told someone would get back to me, no one did. After repeated tries to call and phone just rang with no answers or the same runaround and excuses, I gave up. I managed to keep the areas clean with otc products till completely healed. I did go to a clinic and I was told they wouldn't help me because it was cosmetic and I needed to go back to the dr. that performed the surgery - as I said I was given the runaround. This was very painful and now I can't wear my hair up because of the horrible scars and have to deal with this pulling when I make any facial expression or chew and the scars from the resurfacing and incisions.

All department store cosmetic people don't know what they are doing. I cannot say how many bottles of foundation that I have thrown away. So, I am looking for another loose powder.

This is NOT a case where I just got something wrong. By the way this is the second time this is happened to me with Clinique. The makeup isnÂ’t that great. Armani does a much better job with foundation. It cost a little bit more but youÂ’ve got to try it.

The scent also use to last all day and by the end of my day the scent is gone. This is horrible considering the price of this perfume is much more expensive than before.

I came on here looking to find out what that could be... Apparently there are many other bad reactions in the customer base too. I don't know how a company could hope to remain in business like this.

I also got into using the mascara, eyeliner, lip stains, face wash and eyeshadows. By Jan 2018, I had tried every product they offer. I even was a seller for a few months. Now the bad part. In mid 2017, my skin began changing for the worst. I was getting cystic acne all over my face. I never had acne growing up so this was a shock.

When she came back over to get an order again, I explained to her what happened. She laughed and said hypoallergenic makeup don't do that and she insisted that I had to order. I told her no I wasn't ordering again.
She actually put in an order without my consent and had them ship her the order. She came by a little over a week later with $100+ worth of products and told me that it was my order. When I told her I never placed any order with her she got irritated and demanded money for this order. I never asked for or even knew what it was! My husband came to the door and told her to leave.

He said he would call service and get back with me. That was 11 days ago! During that time, I realized the oven was not getting to the temperate the display indicated. The upper oven was running about 100 degrees cold. The lower oven about 75 degrees cold. Neither oven can maintain the temperature and takes forever to heat up again if you open the door.
March 10 rolls around and I had not been contacted about a service call or update on what was to be done. I called store and spoke, Assistant Manager, he said he just spoke and they are working on it and will call me back. Ok, that didn't happen, again. On March 14, I called the sales associate who sold me the oven and told him what was going on. He said his service guy just happened to be there and he would talk with him and call me right back. Guess what? No return call. I can't use my $2000 oven properly. They never give an answer to any question. Their reply is ""I'll look into it and call you back"". But they won't call you back.

When the two men installed the refrigerator, one damaged the freezer door with a 6-inch dent. I'm not talking a small dent, but a significantly large dent. The delivery guy was so proud he admitted to us HE had dented the door! He was also very apologetic. He made note on the delivery paperwork the freezer door was damaged. He explained he would turn in the paperwork to the repair guy and a new door cover would be ordered immediately. Two weeks goes by and no response.

No return phone call, no follow-up from the store manager.

I notified the store. A representative came to my home, took photographs and assured me that everything would be taken care of. After failing to hear from them, I sent an e-mail, visited the store, made a number of calls, always finding the manager ""not in"".
Eventually, I lodged a complaint with the BBB. Nothing was achieved. Sometime after this unfortunate series of incidents, I purchased a disposal at Lowe's.

He takes it up to the front desk and he looks to see if it has been opened and he and the manager both said ""no it has not been opened."" So I told them both I wanted to look at it and I notice it has been opened.
From there the manager spoke up and said it has been opened and he had been used because the manager said an employee had bought it but lost their job and they brought it back. So they tried to sell me a new comp at a new price.

We bought this on December 31, 2011 for my 50th birthday. We were very happy with the great picture and features. At the time we purchased it from Richard our salesman, he went over all the 3d features with us. We looked through the glasses as he explained how great 3d is. That was a big selling point to us. After we had it a while, we could finally afford to buy blu-ray 3d player, 3d glasses, 3d HDMI chord, & movies totaling around $400. Then we went home & hooked everything up. It wouldn't play! After a while we decided to contact Samsung for their assistance. They had us on hold forever only to come back & inform us that 4600 series was not a 3d TV. We had to have at least a 4700 series or higher. That was news to us!
So we went back to Cleveland store where we purchased it & spoke to Richard. We informed him of our problem & he told us he thought it was a 3d TV as well. We both discussed how it said 3d on the box at time of purchase. He said he was very sorry & that we should speak to Chris the manager. Chris looked at computer with our info & told us sorry, too much time had passed. The only thing he could do is maybe discount $50 off a new 3d TV. At this time, he informed us there is no profit in TVs anymore with the competition out there. But if we wanted to contact the regional manager, Dwayne, maybe he could do something. At this point we felt everyone was passing the ball.
So we called the regional manager Dwayne. He was very short with us. He almost acted like we were a thorn in his foot. He ALSO said there was nothing HE could do about the ""misunderstanding"" and too much time had passed. We really wondered how these 2 managers got in the positions they have with their lack of people skills. All they said they were willing to do was give us a discount buying a NEW TV! Their attitude was that everyone has the money around to spend $900 just to fix the problem. We had saved a long time for that TV, then saved another year to buy the 3d equipment and we don't have the money to just run out & buy a new one!
I recommend to all of you before you buy a TV from Electronics Express to have them plug in the exact TV or item you plan on purchasing. Don't go buy what the box says or salesman tell you. CERTAINLY don't expect them to make any thing right that was done wrong to you. It seems like Electronics Express has some bad business policies, so I guess all I can do is say SHAME ON YOU ELECTRONICS EXPRESS!!!

Be careful of this clown when you see him and guard your wallets. Coming back a few weeks later hoping another salesperson who knew their product would assist me, I run into the salesperson who by the name of Kenny sold my neighbor's their 65"" Samsung.

We had been to various stores and had finally decided on a Bose SoundDock Series II. It was the perfect size and price for our needs. I had seen the SoundDock II at Best Buy for $199.99 and had found the same price on Bose's website. We decided to check to see if Electronic Express at the 100 Oaks Mall in Nashville had it in stock, since the HH Gregg next door did not. Electronic Express did indeed have it in stock, but they were charging $249.99 for it! That's $50 more than the Bose website was listing it!
When we asked if they could price match, and showed them the $199.99 price on the actual Bose website, the manager told us no. That's absolutely ridiculous in my opinion and a lesson well-learned. Be careful what you buy from them. They increase the price for no good reason and rip people off. If they can't price match from the manufacturer's own website, something's definitely wrong with the way they do business. I don't understand how they are still in business, given today's technology. People can just check for lower prices elsewhere at the touch of a button on their phones.
There was a happy ending. We promptly left that store, announcing loudly that we were going to the Bose store at the Opry Mills Mall. When we arrived, we found the SoundDock Series II priced at $199.99, as advertised online. However, there was even a better deal to be found! They had a factory-renewed SoundDock II for only $179.95 plus an extra 10% off! It even comes with a one-year warranty, something Electronic Express wouldn't offer (or if they did, they'd surely charge you for it). It is the perfect system, with clear sound but enough volume to fill the tiny banquet hall for our wedding. We are very pleased with the sales associates at Bose - they were very polite and obviously knew their product.
Long story short, do not buy from Electronic Express! They will overcharge you. If you are looking for a Bose system, go to the actual Bose store. And do your research before shopping. Know which prices are the lowest and where. Don't let Electronic Express bully you into buying a product you know you can buy cheaper elsewhere.",2299,335,336,2,"At the Tullahoma store, an employee by the name of Jeremy installed my high-powered amp on top of my gas tank in a 1996 Mercury Grand Marquis.

Abt needs to call in a specialist to clean the vent? Is vent cleaning brain surgery? I asked if the call applies to vent cleaning and tech said that it did not.
The morning of service he called to say that he was going to put parts for my dryer on the truck but after saying that he'd call back he didn't take 60 seconds to call back. This leads me to believe that I was set up for a second call long before the tech arrived. The vent cleaning is $189 and so I called to complain. They gave me a $33 credit. This token gesture isn't good enough. Maybe Abt is forgetting that half the reason people shop at Abt is service. If I am buying at Abt solely for price then I better shop around a whole lot more. I am feeling that Abt has such a good business that they are not worried about individual customer complaints. Additionally, the tech was in such a rush when he called in the morning and such a rush when he came for service in the afternoon. It was almost rude.",2307,345,346,0,"I have no complaints about the sales agents or prices. 9 days after my order, I hadn't heard anything about my appliances' delivery, so I called Abt and discovered the range had been discontinued, but no one had notified me. The agent nicely threw in a little freebie to the order to make them look good. A couple of days later I called in to make sure the right phone number was in the record (we'd dropped our landline) and was told that my appliances were in the nearby city.
I should be hearing from them anytime to schedule the delivery. But 5 days later I'd heard nothing. Abt uses Custom Global air freight and Custom Global contracts with locals to deliver. But their local partner didn't deliver to our area, so the appliances just sat on their dock until I called and raised a ruckus.

This never happened, and they have now refused to provide communications or assistance in providing access to my Samsung TV when trying to attempt activation that recognizes my account and provides an activation code to enter that returns with an incorrect activation code.
It appears that this company is now owned and operated by a foreign subsidy that appears to be milking the Napster accounts without providing services being paid for nor providing client follow up.

The managers are rude and unprofessional and they tell me there is nothing they can do because it has been over 60 days since the charge appeared!!! That is a lie since I have been calling since day 2. They drag your case so days go by and they claim you are responsible for not pursuing your case. That is 100% lies. They are the most unprofessional and rude managers I have ever talked to. Instead of resolving your case, they argue and insult. They are liars.

I called about 5 times back to back, each time the same man answered the phone, and when I told him I had already made the purchase and didn't need to purchase anything, he hung up. After the 3rd attempt I called the number on both my home phone and my cell. The cell call was again cut off--because he probably recognized the number; however the same guy answered the call made from the home phone. When I started talking, he said ""just a minute"" and then played music--on hold I assume. The music played for at least 30 minutes, and eventually that call was disconnected as well.
If I have to go to iTunes, I'll just do without the product. All I needed was assistance for a product purchased from their site. They could have answered the question and been off the call in a matter of seconds. This was a mean-spirited individual, who after 5 calls, gives a pretty good representation of iTunes as a whole.

What started out about $2 is now up to $56! Today I call to try and figure out how to get to the root of the problem so there won't be any issues. First call is 26 minutes, was placed on hold while the rep credited my account and was to send links on all the ways I can prevent the issue only for her to disconnect the call and not call back.
Call a second time, call last 38 minutes with a rep and supervisor. I was told the previous call a supervisor denied the refund because I've been credited previously. Said in the notes I've received information on how to correct the issues when in reality I had not. Nasty supervisor and by the end of the call she says she can't discuss the account because he's listed as an adult even though she understands he's 12! Are you serious Apple?! She refuses to help any further. So in order for me to dispute the $56 in charges that will reoccur monthly I have to cancel the debit card and dispute the charges with the bank. Problem is, it's my husband's card and he's out of town on business so that would leave him without any funds and he has to be the one to cancel and complete the paperwork anyways. I had previously deleted the card off my son's phone but that also removed it from being able to track.
Can't have that, as the tracking option has saved his phone from a person that stole it last year. In order for me to gain control of his phone I had to lie about his age, and make him 13. No help to Apple support with that either as they didn't provide the information. I've now done everything on my end to stop the charges and just want my money back and I'm only asking for the month of March! We had deleted the apps but didn't realize that doesn't matter.

I re-positioned the antenna and still no signal. I tried a backup satellite radio that had never been used and I had the exact same problem: no signal in the house or in the car.

Today, same scenario, except I was told that the plan didn't cover car maker installed sets, only portable units. So I reminded the idiot that I did it before and paid a $75 fee, that incidentally I was never advised when I asked back in 09. I was then informed ""we did it as a courtesy"" yet I wasn't told that at the time, of said ""courtesy"". I was reminded that I must have read the terms and conditions... I guess over the phone...

I recall telling the thief that sold me this garbage plan that I always upgrade vehicles every 2-4 years sometimes more, so I didn't see this as something for me. But she assured me that I get 3 (maybe 4?) vehicle changes, didn't matter when, so it's seemed like a pretty decent deal. Now I am told that it was only for portable units. But since I never owned one in the first place, why on earth would I have needed that plan then anyway! And I think that would have/should have been relayed back in 2013 upon that transfer.

The unauthorized charge of $102.44 which equates to $17.07/mo. Did the current rate go up $2.08 in two weeks?
Next complaint is I was excited for the low fee and got it for my dad to travel with me so he could listen to oldies. Never really used it much on my own. He paid the fee, so I wasn't aware of a need to cancel anything but used my card and he paid me. I now see the new letter has this at the bottom. But Sirius XM doesn't sent out any reminders, they just charge the card. My payday hadn't occurred, so when XM charged my card I had low funds in my account. The charge was $102.44 + an NSF fee of $35. The next few charges that day for Amazon, food etc. caused me to be charged 6 more NSF fees total. My bank agreed that if SiriusXM was unwilling to credit this much they would reimburse me with a letter from SiriusXM.
After faxing my personal banking information to god knows where I finally got a message from a I believe. She responded ""I like only see one NSF fee so that is all I'm wiling to send you.""

When I called Orbitz I asked specifically if my flight tickets would be refundable if my trip to Texas had to be postponed for this reason. She reassured me a number of times that for $44 per ticket, they would be refundable. Then I told her that I possibly may rent a car. After giving me the price of the tickets, she proceeded to give me the price of the car rental.
As I was questioning her about the prices, all of a sudden she told me the price of the tickets went up a considerable amount. Then she said, ""But if you rent the car I can give you a lower price on the tickets."" Red flags suddenly went up but I was so pleased that I was getting refundable tickets I figured paying a bit more for the tickets was worth it. After I told her the times of the flights that I wanted she said I would be receiving an itinerary in my email. I hung up. I saw I received the itinerary, but I did not check it over.
A couple days later I went into my email and noticed one of the flights was not correct. I called Orbitz and the man told me there was nothing he could do and if I wanted to change/cancel the flight it would cost $200 per ticket. Then I figured since I was on the phone with him I would confirm with him the refundable tickets and asked if my tickets would be refundable for the reason stated above. He told me my tickets are only refundable for medical emergencies. Needless to say, I was furious. I cancelled the insurance. I then told him I wanted to talk to a supervisor about the mistake on my flight. He said a supervisor would call me within 48 hours. I waited 2 days... no call. I called them back. Waited a long time on the phone. Finally spoke to a supervisor. It got me nowhere.
The 2 previous people I talked to were foreigners. They were extremely difficult to communicate with. (That's probably why she made a mistake.) I asked the supervisor a few times if she could listen to the recording of my conversation with the girl who placed my reservation, but she totally ignored my request. At the beginning of each phone call they state that the conversation is recorded. If it is, then why can't they go back and listen to it? Isn't that why it's supposedly being recorded?

Obviously my last call was a complete waste of time. They re-did the transaction. Then the sales rep told me that were having a special promotion where I could receive a free second radio to use at home with a 30-day free promotion and a minimal monthly charge after that. I decided to try it (what was I thinking?). The only thing I had to pay for was the shipping.
When I received the radio, I could not get a signal (no windows facing south). So I had to call Customer Care again. They gave me the information to mail the radio back and told me that they had cancelled the second subscription. I mailed the radio out the next day. A few days later, I received an email confirming that they had received the radio back. I thought all was well (I should have known better). Several weeks later I logged into my account and lo and behold, the second subscription was still active and about to automatically renew! I called Customer Service again. The rep I spoke to said that there would be a $50 early termination fee...for the free promotional period for a radio that I couldn't get a signal for and had returned! I hit the roof with these clowns. They transferred me to sales where a rep admitted that the previous reps probably did not tell me about the early termination fee and didn't properly cancel the second subscription.
When I threatened to cancel all service, then she fixed the error and told me that there wouldn't be an early termination fee even though the confirmation email would say that there might be one. What the heck?? Her explanation was that they don't know exactly what these emails say. For real! So now I am going to have to be vigilant to make sure that there are no inappropriate charges. This is perhaps the worst customer service group that I have ever encountered. I do like the radio service, but if what I encountered this past month is any indication, trying to cancel any type of service is an absolute nightmare. I was going to try their internet radio service, but now I won't because they make it impossible to cancel anything!
Their phone tree is also impossible to navigate. No matter how deep you go, you won't find a selection to speak to a representative. The only way I got through to one was to say ""speak to a representative"" when asked if I wanted choice 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. And their call centers are located overseas which meant that I got to speak to a rep named ""Jay"" whose Indian accent was so thick I couldn't understand him. I kept telling the sales rep throughout our conversation that ""this is how you lose customers.Â” She also put me on hold for ten minutes. Nightmare service!",2331,372,373,2,"Every year in December I receive all sorts of mail offers regarding renewal deals and telephone calls asking me about my intentions about renewing my account. Each year, I'm told the going rate is about $175. For the last 3 years I have worked with the service folks and have negotiated a yearly rate somewhere between $80 and $90. This year however, I received a notice stating that I now have a past due balance of $178.32. A week later, I received another notice stating that my account was overdue and I owed $25.34 and that I could renew my service by paying $176.32.
When I spoke to the service representative last year, I was ""guaranteed"" 1 year of service for $96 if I paid at that moment, which I did. I was told that my end of contract date was January 10, 2015 and I was no longer under ANY OBLIGATION. Today, when I called about the ""past due"" notice, I was told that my account was now past due in the about of $34. I told Janea the representative last year told me that my obligation ended on 1/10 and she told me that it did, but I failed to call to cancel my membership and that my membership was ""suspended"".
I told the Janea again that the previous rep told me that I was paying for 1 year of service and that I was not under any obligation for anything more than that year and she insisted that my account reflected a past due amount. Interestingly, each time I call, I get a different story. I simply will not pay for a service which I did not opt for, nor did I receive. I wish that I could just remove the Sirius hardware from my vehicle. What a racket!",2332,374,375,2,"I have received 1-2 calls everyday from Sirius for a month. My husband had a subscription running from Dec. 2013-Dec. 2014 and we had decided not to opt in for ""automatic renewal"" when we subscribed last year. In December 2014, we decided to NOT renew the subscription. After answering the non-stop, hardcore sales calls twice and declining to renew our subscription, I stopped answering the phone calls from Sirius. Some calls came from our local area code, and Sirius is not based locally, so I assume they are running through spoofed numbers, and some have come from toll-free numbers.
Today, one month after the subscription ran out, I received a call from Sirius billing, demanding $18.79 for an overdue bill. Upon returning the call, I was informed that Sirius had let the subscription run for an extra month as a ""courtesy"" and now wanted payment for that month of unauthorized, unwanted service. I refused to pay and urged Sirius to send me a bill, along with a signed contract or copy of a phone call, wherein I authorized the month of ""courtesy"" service. Really shocking that a company is so desperately, illegally, and unethically demanding money for services that were never authorized. I certainly will not be paying the bogus bill, and I will NEVER subscribe to Sirius again.",2333,375,376,2,"I recently purchased a baby bunny from Pet Kingdom. She was very sweet and I was instantly attached to her. A day or two after I had her I noticed she was weak and had a large amount of wet stool. I did some research and saw that this could be a sign of a fatal illness. I rushed her to an emergency vet at 2 am in Naples. I found out she was infested with worms and that the worms had caused a bloat in her intestines that is fatal to rabbits. Over a period of three days I racked up over $1300 in vet bills.
She is currently stable but still has quite a fight. I have worked/managed pet stores in the past and am familiar with pet store issues and animals mills. I called Pet Kingdom to make them aware of the situation since these worms are extremely contagious and most likely all the other bunnies are infected. My main concern is the health of all animals and those who purchase their companions. I have purchased animals from pet stores before but this will be my last. BREEDER OR RESCUE ONLY!!!",2334,376,377,0,"I am very upset with this pet store... I recently purchased a German Shepherd puppy that was 12 weeks old. She seemed fine at the time. I have had her less than a week and knew there was something wrong with her. She wasn't playful like a normal HEALTHY puppy should be. So I took her into my vet. Come to find out she was running a 103.5 temp and has a major respiratory infection. While we were at Pet Kingdom there was another German Shepherd puppy there that was not moving and look very very thin. I am assuming she caught this from him.
I went onto Pet Kingdom's site to read other reviews and have read a lot of similar reviews stating that people have purchased sick puppies and Pet Kingdom's response to them is to just return the dog for another one or a full refund. SERIOUSLY? This place need an overhaul and to hire new employees who truly care about the well-being of these animals.",2335,378,379,1,"From the front door it may seem like a awesome pet store, BUT do not be fooled. Just bought an animal yesterday from this ""Pet Kingdom"". The animal we bought was nothing like they told me it would be. It was all just lies. Had to tear up the house to get the stinker out of the wall, went to give it back (not even 24 hours later) and just had accusations and rudeness thrown at us. They are not helpful what-so-ever nor do they even care about the health or well-being of the animals there. The animals in the pet store seem sick; runny noses, fuzzy eyes, wheezing, wounds and sores on the animals... Not to mention, the poor puppies did not have any room in their encounter at all, plus it all reeks of urine.
The owner and staff do not Love animals, they just want Money. It is completely absurd. Very disappointed. EXTREMELY RUDE SERVICE - NOT ANIMAL LOVERS. THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. How can we do something about this?",2336,379,380,1,"I'm organizing a group lawsuit against this store. The conditions those animals are kept in are horrible. The puppy I have bought from this place had Giardia Infection and Coccidiosis in addition to kennel cough. As you know Giardia is contagious to humans and other pets. It's not enough to return the sick pet to the store (you have 24 hours from purchasing to return the pet for full refund).
PLEASE get a vet, check your other pets, Kids and yourself for Giardia. Ask the vet for an ELISA test. The parasite not always shows on a regular fecal float test at the vet office. Keep checking monthly fecal float test for the first 3 to 4 months after treatment is completed, followed by an ELISA test to make sure the infection is truly cleared. If you had a bitter experience with Pet Kingdom, please call me with information. This place got to be stopped. No animal deserve to get there. My phone is 869-853-9924.",2337,380,381,2,"I purchased a Beagle for my wife and kids on Valentines Day 2012. They had fallen in love with him on a previous visit. We would occasionally stop in when we were out and about just to look at all the animals. I have always been against buying from pets stores and instead going through private breeders or sellers. For the same reasons all of these other folks have stated.
The dog ""has papers."" Except after two years, he still doesn't. They won by waiting us out. After nearly a year, I finally gave up. It was always ""We'll get back to you"", or ""There's a holdup with this or that"", etc. No one ever did a thing. I am giving the extremely condensed version of that whole fiasco. I grew up with a Beagle, then had a roommate who had a Beagle that lived with us. I am no expert, although the dog we got from Pet Kingdom was like no Beagle I'd ever been around. Again, long story short. Problem after problem with health and demeanor, etc.
I have also never been a fan of circuses. Over the years, it seems as though Pet Kingdom has turned into as much a kind of mini zoo/animal attraction type of place as a pet store. They really load up on the exotics to draw people in, but do not seem as though they are equipped to properly care for the animals they have. Maybe the bare minimum to pass state standards but that's really a shame. I'm not some hippie treehugger but come on, these animals are clearly not happy or comfortable. And by the comments on here, including mine, it's obvious they are not concerned with operating an ethically proper business.",2338,381,382,0,"I am very disappointed that there are so many employees and none of them care for the animals in the shop. I first went to check on the Betta section where they always put them in little cups. I almost cry looking at just some of them because the water was all green for most of it and two Betta fishes (maybe more) were dead and many seem like they were about to die too. I just walked away while looking for an employee to talk with. I think those dumb people do not feed them because they also looked very hungry. I felt like punching those fools in the face. How would they feel if that was them in the cage sitting in their piss and until taken into a better place?
I went to speak with the cashier and told her about this situation. They better do something and fix it or it will be sent to the authorities (and YouTube) after I film it. Well I'm just getting started. After checking the Bettas, I saw another dead one in a large tank maybe dead for 2 days now... It was even worse than what I saw earlier. While looking at the rabbits that were displayed for the customers, one of the larger ones jumped over to eat the hamsters' food and none of the employees did anything. Whatever I guess... One day, those who does not care for all living things will be treated the same in their after life. Working in these kinds of environment should have more caring people, not people who want to kill time and play games.",2339,382,383,1,"I just want to say that anyone that has had a bad experience there should contact an attorney, when it comes to a sick animal and not entitled (as they say) to a full refund because they are absolutely required by law to refund your money if you have a sick pet. Any contract or purchase in the United States, you have 72 business hours to get out of any purchase made. Any attorney would be more than happy to go after a store like this with no charge to you as the consumer. They work based upon contingency. So if you do not get your money back, they do not get paid. Just thought I would put that out there for all of the misfortunate people that have had a bad experience.",2340,383,384,2,"I purchased a 5-month-old Weimaraner from Pet Kingdom in 2002. After he grew a little, it was very obvious that he was not a pure breed Weimaraner. He grew to be a lean 120 lbs., about 40 lbs. more than the breed standard. My veterinarian believed he probably had Great Dane in his blood line as his muzzle was also very square and not standard to the breed.
Additionally, my dog had health problems from the time I brought him home. The worst was the severe allergies he had to almost everything. He would swell up so much he couldn't breathe and had to be taken to the emergency vet many times over the years. After years of medications and trips to specialists to keep my pet going, he passed away recently with hip dysplasia. In his 11-year life I spent over $25,000 on emergency and additional medical treatments for my dog.
I purchased a second Weimaraner in 2005 from a reputable breeder and we have not had a single vet visit outside of her regular visits. She has been healthy and I believe it is because of good breeding. Unfortunately, my first dog who I loved so very much did not start off with the same good genes and Pet Kingdom is to blame for that.",2341,386,387,1,"Purchased a King Charles Cavalier in May 2017. Dog had kennel cough, but I waited until she was cured before taking her home. I was told she came from a reputable Amish breeder. Recently I noticed she was not walking right on her back legs. As required, after contacting Petland, I was told to take her to the Petland vet. She was diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia. Then Petland told me to call Pet Solutions the company that handles the guarantees. After numerous calls to them I still have not received a course of action or a resolution to this serious problem. If she came from a reputable breeder this could not have happened as it is a hereditary condition. They recently had another Cavalier from the same breeder and they were aware of this problem with mine and still did not remove the dog from being on display for sale. At this point I do not know what further action I can take to rectify this situation. I really need help.
Updated on 06/23/2018: In spite of all efforts I cannot get any satisfaction from either Petland or Pet Solutions the guarantee company, and now it is almost the end of June. The guarantee they give with the dogs are useless because if you need to use it all you get from them is that paperwork needs to be done or they didn't receive paperwork needed. Paper documentation was sent to them 3 different times. My advice to anyone considering buying a dog from Petland is NOT to walk away from Petland BUT TO RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN.",2342,387,388,0,"We bought a Shiba Inu May 13, 2018 as a Mother's Day gift for $3300. We were told that the $500 off promo they had plus the $100 off upon reserving was already taken out of the price. This was the first flag, surely a Shiba Inu from a pet store is not that expensive?! Unless the puppy has a legitimate line? When asked about the puppy's parents we were told that they were AKC registered, no other response regarding pedigree information. Upon reading the paperwork afterwards, they are only ACA registered, and I can't find any information online about the sire and dam of 'Tri-Star Kennels'. When we were at the store, the puppy pooped soft to watery stools 3x.
We thought she was just stressed. Brought her home and diarrhea continued in the car and in the house. Did not sleep due to her pooping all night till morning. Brought her to the vet they say she has worms and giardia virus. She's been coughing and still pooping with blood. I have had dogs, never did I see them in the state this Shiba is in.

The staff reassured her that the puppy she fell in love with was a perfect match. Having spent a small fortune for the puppy she then took the pup to the vet that Petland recommend. They put the pup on antibiotics straight away. Over the next day the pup went to a registered trainer who noticed very quickly that the pup was very sick. Dreadful hacking cough, not eating at all - regardless what she tried to give her, very lethargic & very runny stools.
We contacted the store whom said that there was nothing wrong with the pup. In the end we took the puppy back to the store. She was in such a sick state. It was such a heartbreaking experience for my daughter to go through - there was no way this puppy should have been sold to my daughter. Esp as the staff knew it was to be a service animal. Please Please Please beware of the state these poor animals in. They are too many dogs in each crate that is one has a illness they will all get it.

Everyone please read this! I purchased a puppy from this establishment. I purchased him because I felt sorry for him and my kids really wanted him. We asked to see the puppy and when they brought him to us he smelled so disgusting I wanted to throw up! Every one of the cages had urine and feces all over. When I made the final decision to purchase the puppy I asked the associate to please give him a bath because he stunk so bad. They told me they would take him back to give him a bath. So when they took him back I watched through the glass and they did not give him a bath. All they did was spray him with dog cologne. I still took him anyways, even though I wasnÂ’t happy about that.
When we were doing the paperwork, I flat out asked the associate if he had all his shots. He showed me the paperwork that showed the shots that he has received and told me that yes he had all the shots except for rabies. The associate told me that all he needed was rabies and his yearly shots. This was a complete lie to my face. I took the puppy to the veterinarian 4 days after purchasing him and the veterinarian told me that he needed several series of shots still that were going to cost me even more money. This establishment is ripping people off! They charged me over $2000 for this puppy that isnÂ’t even recognized as a breed with the AKC. The associate also lied to my face when I asked point-blank about the refund policy.

They said that I would have to place a new order. I then placed a new order for 2 Choat Leopard Wrasse and asked that if both were not available to please send at least one.
I called several times including the day of shipment to verify this. The day the order was to ship they canceled my order again. I called to find out why and was told they had only one Choat Wrasse so the order was canceled. I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

At the time of purchase she had a slight runny nose. (This purchase was made on a Friday). I was informed this was normal and that she was fine. Then on Monday she was hospitalized for a severe case of pneumonia. I was not guaranteed that she would survive. I tried getting in contact with a manager there and was told that I needed to contact another company to report this to. Also at the time of purchase, I was rushed through all the paperwork and was not explained everything that was included. She was financed through a 3rd party and I ""wasn't"" given all of the paperwork.
It took me almost a year to get a copy especially of the ""guarantee"". Also when I took her to my vet for the pneumonia, I found/saw that there was a possible heart defect. On the paperwork from her wellness check, it was handwritten to have the heart rechecked. Months later I have taken her back due to other problems, my vet recommends me to have her spade. There is no guarantee, due to her size, that she would be able to carry a litter. I have an AKC registered English Mastiff that I wanted to breed her with and cannot. (FYI... on the guarantee form, that I was rushed through, says there is no guarantee on being able to breed or on show quality).
My vet has informed me that she is the ""smallest"" Mastiff she has ever seen. (1 year old @ 80 lbs.) If I bred her with my Mastiff, it would kill her. NOW, we are working to have surgery on her eyes and have had to deal with ""dog acne"". These are hereditary traits. I was trying to contact the breeder, but guess what, they are being investigated also. What I don't understand is, WHY does Petland charge so much for the animals if there is no guarantee? I have tried to solve this problem and I keep getting the run around from them and Solutions.Pet, that now I'm going public!! I DO NOT recommend Petland of Kennesaw. I'm glad I have my Annie Oakley.

I contacted Petland where I purchased her, in which they in turn had me call their Management group.

We usually don't care for choke or prong collars, but we had tried harnesses and leather collars and she chewed them up while she was wearing them and even during walks. So we bought a Top Paw choke chain, thinking she can't chew it up, right? well, it broke. At first it didn't occur to me that this was a bad quality product, even though my dog is only 50 lbs. So I went back to PetSmart and bought a prong collar. I bought it in the store, so I didn't think of reading the online reviews which was a big mistake. I fitted the collar according to the tag ""rest gently on the neck"" not too tight, not too loose.
But the links in the collar just came apart during a walk, which resulted in my dog running into traffic and getting killed by a truck. The collar didn't break, it just unclasped, and my dog wasn't pulling hard, she was barely putting any force at all. When I started looking into it, I found that I am not the only one. Some people have had this specific collars fitted by professional trainers and it would still come apart, some people say they have tried other brands and this problem is only with Top Paw, many people have had their dogs run off because of this issue and PetSmart has known about it for over a year.
They know this is a safety issue and they haven't done anything about it, not even a label on the collar to advise of this safety concern so that people take the necessary precautions. When I contacted PetSmart about it they tried to blame it on me, saying the collar comes with an user guide that explains this, which is a lie. The collar does not come with a warning nor an user guide, the tag in the collar says you can buy additional tips separately as if a safety warning is optional to provide. They don't care about the safety of our pets, they only care about making money. I understand it is a business and businesses need money, but no matter what, you cannot sell products that are unsafe and much less without a warning.
And these collars are not even the only unsafe product sold at their stores. There is a large quantity and variety of bones that are unsafe and can easily kill a dog, I never buy them because as a Veterinary Assistant I know the dangers of those products. But not everyone knows about it, just like I didn't know about their brand of collars.

I made an appointment about two weeks ago for this morning at 7:30, bundled the cat into her carrier and headed to PetSmart. Checking her in, I produced her rabies vaccination certificate, and was asked if she has any health problems. No, I said. Then I was asked if she had a heart murmur. She has been diagnosed with a slight murmur -- but so have I and no one tells me I can't run ultramarathons or anything.
So I said, yes, but she's not on treatment for it because it's not serious. And they refused to shave her. I said, ok, what if I told you she doesn't have a heart murmur, and they said, no, can't do it. The question is -- why didn't they ask these questions when I made the appointment? And why don't they have a waiver or indemnification clause? I've had the same thing done twice before with no problem. They must've had a cat die on them and then blamed it on a heart murmur. Ridiculous. I""m going to start shopping for dog food and cat food and turtle food by mail.",2353,399,400,2,"Called PetSmart/Banfield regarding my dog's ear infection. I explained to the receptionist that my dog would absolutely not let anyone examine her and that we've been down that road before. (Previously, I had to swab my dog in order for them to run the lab work) so taking her in for an examination is a waste of my time unless the plan is to put her to sleep for a simple ear examination... I told her that I'd misplaced the ear drops and never completed the cycle hence why she is displaying the same exact symptoms, mind it has only been about 2.5 weeks since her ear infection was diagnosed.
I asked if they could please provide a new Rx since it was pretty clear it never healed properly. I called about 5 p.m., was told they'd speak to the Dr. and someone would call me back. I called again ""before they close"" around 6:20 p.m....the receptionist stated Dr. is still there and that I would get a call back around 7. The receptionist (not the Dr.) called back and stated Dr. would need to see my dog in order to make a determination whether she would require same med, etc.
I told the girl once again that my dog will NOT let anyone examine her, and if I could speak with the Dr...at this point she had already became defensive and her tone was altered, she proceeded to place me on hold, came back and said Dr. is now off the clock and there's nothing she could do and ended call. I tried calling back and of course once place is closed, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of anyone, not even management.
The point to my review here, is that the Dr. could not take one minute out of her day to speak with me regarding my dog. The customer service turns ugly if you don't follow their protocol of ""nickel and diming"" the customer. I've gone to PetSmart Banfield for some years now for my cats, turtle and recently for my German Shepherd. I've always looked the other way when they came at us with their nickel and diming, but now it's different, my German Shepherd is in pain and the Dr. could not even take the time to speak with me.
Isn't that their job? To care for animals? If you don't appreciate your job as an animal caregiver then leave.

The clothing arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but upon recieving the clothes it was apparent that nothing was going to fit. We repackaged the items and sent them all back for exchanges for a smaller size. I specifically requested the amount for any clothing that couldn't be exchanged be refunded to my card. At the beginning of October, I was notified that most of the clothing was no longer available, the clothing that could be exchanged totaled approximately $90. The remainder of the balance should have been a net $142. There is some slight return charge on your order which was less than $10. So lets call the net balance owed to me $132. Here is where things get very fishy. My account was refunded an incorrect $125, about $7 to $10 dollars short of the correct refund amount. But it only gets stranger from there. The next thing that occurred was a $90 charge on my credit card for the clothing they exhanged.Â Let me be clear. I paid $232 to express, the clothing that was kept by me in the end totaled $90 in value. The rest was returned. The difference owed to my account $142 minus $10 return charge. As I said a credit of $125 was added to my account (almost correct, just ~$10 short) and THEN express.com charged my account $90 dollar. They did this so that I would have an exact $100-dollar value which they then tried to send to me as a gift card instead of my requested cash refund. I am fully aware that if you pay with a gift card you will be refunded with that form of payment. But the clothing i kept ($90 worth) accounts for 90% of the gift card. The money should have been refunded into my bank account. WHICH IT WAS. They then removed funds fraudulently from my account, essentially ordering a $100 gift card without my permission. KEEP IN MIND I SPENT MY GIFT CARD. I kept $90 in clothes. A ten dollar refund to my gift card would be one thing. It appeared that they were going to do that when I received the $125 dollar credit to my bank account. When express.com charged my account $90 (two days after i received the $125 credit) and then attempted to send me a gift card, it was underhanded, slimy, and borderline fraudulent. When I asked why this happened I was told it was their policy to refund the first form of payment. I asked the express.com representative (a supervisor at this pont) if they were aware of any online store that didnÂ’t first require you apply the gift card and then pay the remaining balance, including express.com. There isn't of course, thatÂ’s just not how these online payment forms work. To make it simple, the express.com policy on an order where a gift card is applied, is to refund the gift card first instead of the money you paid out of pocket. A terrible business practice that was obviously created so they could keep your money obligated to their Express Stores. In short, the paragraph before this one IS NOT what happened. They sent the exchange on Friday (notified me of shipment) and issued a (slightly incorrect by $10) refund on the next day. On Monday three days after I was notified of the exchange shipment, express.com charged my account $90 and attempted to send me a gift card that I didn't authorize. They USED my account FREUDULENTLY to purchase a gift card to send me in place of a cash refund I requested and deserved.

At around 7 weeks I was attempting to call and call and no one called me back. I finally received the bottoms to the suit at about 7 1/2 weeks out. They didn't fit right. At about 8 weeks I received my top which also didn't fit. By this time I just wanted my money back (having heard they were out of the sizes I would need). I made contact with the consultant who told me I could return it and be refunded my money. She told me what form to fill out, what to send and where to send it. I sent it back the beginning of June. Here it is the middle of July and they still have my money and my swimsuit. I just phoned the owner who was completely rude and she replied We don't refund for swimming suits.

We had horrible service. We sat down at 5:30pm. We were not served our food until 7:15pm. One hour and 45 minutes later? I even had to get our own drink refills multiple times. Once we had our food, it was not done correctly but we were afraid to send it back due to time constraints. For example, my wife ordered cheesy broccoli soup. She commented that it was dipped and set out awhile because the top layer of cheese was not melty. It had formed at the top. My steak was over done. I ordered medium, but it came well done. No pink at all. My daughter ordered the kids pancakes with sprinkles. There were no sprinkles. I had to ask for a steak knife and my rolls. When we were able to talk to the manager, her response was that we have a new waitress, and this is her first time. It was not crowded so she should have been fine. I assume that you train them before hand? We were also told that the average wait time is 12 minutes for food. We waited 105 minutes. That is 8.75 times longer than the average. If the average is 12 minutes, that would mean that some people would be getting their food in 60 seconds. We had my parents who had to get home and were delayed because of this.

I have tried to contact the restaurant for a refund at least partial since they had lied to us about the show. But the restaurant is not willing to fix the problem.

There were small children in close vicinity that unfortunately heard her derogatory statements/ outburst and even the children's parents were so offended by the repugnant comments made by Windi they left shortly after I did.

I was with my girlfriend at the time and mentioned that I did not order the platter. Instead of the waitress admitting she made a mistake on her ticket order, she played it off as if it was my fault, yelled at me several times even thoughÂ I was acting calm, and told the manager I was a liar. The manager came over and told me that I had to pay for the platter since I ordered it even though I did not order it or he was going to call the police. He raised his voice several times at me and was threatening. This was my first time at Ike's in Sterling Heights and I will never go back there again.

Here is why: The place was cold, we asked if they could change our table, they did but it was still cold. The server looked like hated his job, he wasnÂ’t rude, but as you may imagine eating in a restaurant that the server hated his job and just wanted to get ride of customers was a pain. Â  I asked for a glass of wine. He brought wine but not in regular glass wine, but in a small cup! If you ever drank wine, you know when the wine is old, you get headache. The wine he brought me was old. Because that old bad wine, I got headache for the rest of the day. They charged me $9 for such a nasty wine! Those guys think people are stupid! I asked him; till our lunch is ready can we have some bread and butter or something like it, just like other restaurants. He brought some bread with no butter and charged me $3 for it. Those kinds of bread are free in other restaurants. Â  I asked the server why that place is so wired; she said that place is a sport fast food. But they charged me $10 for service!Â  Â  We order two salads and I asked him to bring me their popular food but not sandwich. I told him that I hate eating sandwich in a restaurant. He brought a burger sandwich anyway! There was nothing especial about food, really nothing especial and just ordinary food that you can find everywhere.Â  Â  After all those pain, they gave us the check that was about $70 for two salads, a burger and a glass of wine. As I said they charged me $10 as service. Â  That RAM restaurant was way overpriced. The food and service never ever worth even near the half of $70. I donÂ’t recommend this place to anybody at all.

They would frequently get the order incorrect, but nothing major and nothing that they would not fix IF I caught it before taking it home. This one particular time, I went through the drive-thru since I had my children in the car with me. After a less-than-friendly greeting and request for my order, I started giving my 5-item selection. After listing only 2 items, the voice at the other end of the speaker started to rattle on about something incoherent to me. I stopped giving my order and said Excuse me? and was told (rudely) that she was not talking to me and that she was listening, finish my order. I started over again, not truly convinced that someone having 2 conversations would be paying all that much attention to either, and was told with as much sass as I am sure that she could muster up, I am not deaf. You gave me those things already. Did you want something else or are you done? I was stunned to silence for a moment which prompted that sassy voice to again ask, Did you want something? I don't have all day! I told her that she could delete my order and that I would not be returning as I did not appreciate her tone. Now, before someone assumes that I was rude, I did say this firmly but professionally as I am in the company of my children. I rode around to exit the drive-thru and was greeted by the voice, now a person standing behind a bullet-proof window, with her middle finger extended to me in what I can only assume is her best attempt at a Goodbye. This branch of Wendy's is not listed in the phone book, so I called another branch manager (Lincoln, RI) that heard my story and was appalled. They stated that their branch was privately owned and that the troubled branch was corporate-owned. They graciously gave me the phone# for Corporate Headquarters and wished me luck. Before hanging up the phone, the privately owned branch offered me a few free meal coupons for my trouble as he felt bad for the service that I received at another branch carrying the same name! How nice! I called Corporate Headquarters and, after 2 failed attempts to locate a human being, was told by the secretary that I would need to speak with Chris and that he would call me back if I left him a message. Needless to say, I left 2 messages 2 days apart and never received any calls back.

In Feb. of 2003, the love of my life changed her mind, and the wedding was off. Heart broken, I went to the restaurant asking for the deposit back, having noted that I gave them way over a years notice to fill that room. They assured me that when the room was filled, I would get my deposit back. Well, here it is, a year later, and less than a week to the day that I would have been married, and they tell me that the room is not booked, after all that time. They refuse to give me even a small part of that money back. Imagine, $750.00 just for the half hour it took them to show me the room and scribble my name in a book. They are hiding behind company policy while doing something that at best is greedy, and at worst, is downright WRONG!

A group of 14 people visited the Spanish restaurant complete with flaminco dancers, this past Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. The group was originally supposed to be 20 people, but after a few could not make it, 14 was the final number. After a couple hours of eating and drinking, the bill came...just shy of $700.00. After carefully inspecting the bill, it was determined that the party was charged for the additional 6 people included in the reservation EVEN THOUGH NO FOOD WAS ORDERED OR PREPARED FOR THOSE PEOPLE! When the manager was confronted with the extra meals that were added to the FOOD portion of the bill as one lump sum so as to hide the extra phony charges he said they have a policy that whatever your reservation is for, you are charged for that many meals. After explaining that this was a birthday and the night was being ruined by adding food to the bill, the manager agreed to take two of the meals off of the bill. This still left over $100.00 in extra food that was not order or prepared. In fact, the food that was added to the bill was not even offered to eat there or to take home. The manager was not swayed by the fact that the Better Business Bureau, untold numbers of friends and associates and internet sites would be told of this gouging. He said that was their policy, which was NEVER relayed on the phone or in person. His customer service came to an end when he stated that if we were angry and vowed to never return, there was nothing he could do about it. Do not frequent this establishment. It is a shady establishment at best that despite the acceptable food and entertainment, is not worth the headache when it comes time to settle the bill.",2414,466,467,1,"My wife and I were on vacation in Nags Head, N.C. At 3:50 p.m. we decided to dine at the KFC restaurant there. After ordering our food, we went to be seated. We looked the dining area over to find a clean table but ended up wiping one off our selves. The seats were covered with crumbs of food also, so we had to wipe the seats too. While dining there were several young people, dressed in KFC uniforms sitting at nearby tables. They were having a rap session or something. You would not believe the vulgarities they were using in their conversations. Very, very ugly language. They paid us no attention. I thought to myself that colonel Sanders would roll over in his grave if he knew his employees were being so disrespectful while customers were dining.

They had no way to run their tickets to serve dinner and the needed an emergency response call. I am a computer/network specialist with my own business serving small businesses in the greater Knoxville area. I arrived on scene to find that they had blown the motherboard in their main PC due to shorting out their primary parallel printer cable repeatedly. Within 3 hours I had located a similar Pc and migrated their POS software (which they had a pirated copy and not payed for... should have known) over to the new PC and had it up and working including installing all of their printer drivers (aside from the one with the short) correctly. I even stayed close by for the dinner rush in case they needed me. I billed them for the new (used) PC and the time that I spent working (not being on call) and they never paid me or even acknowledged my bills.

And Wow, watch your credit card, and the amount you sign for! Food is expensive for a strip mall atmosphere,Â OK but not fine dining. Entrees are bare, with no garnish or side items included. Corkage fee and a plate fee (for bringing in wine or a Birthday cake) are extra added charges. AND, as I recently found out, if THEY forget to add an item to your bill (like a soda refill), they will arbitrarily increase the charge amount you have authorized on your credit card AFTER YOU LEAVE, to pay themselvesÂ later for THEIR own mistake.

Luke told me it would be $800. I told him I was quoted $600-$700 by Jordan. He talked to his superior and they agreed to do it for $700, but they needed my debit card information now.

Chef Ramsey would definitely agree with me about the fact that this establishment has no regard whatsoever for the customer's concerns- much less, the quality of service to put it quite politely. It's one thing when you have had a bad experience with a waitress, but when you try to tell the Manager or Owner's wife- to advise them of a bad customer service experience with their staff and they publicly embarrass you as well as themselves (yelling at customers with flailing arms and telling them not to complain and that if they don't like how they are treated then they don't have to come back again!).

Companies like Car Outlet pray on poor, desperate people for a quick and easy buck. Please be aware when purchasing a car from Car Outlet. In all honesty just walk, take a bus take a taxi because in the long run a taxi will be cheaper. Â  I purchased a car here a few years back and thankfully just finished paying it off. They screwed me over with a mediocre, BS insurance that when I needed it, it didn't cover me and I ended up paying out of pocket. If you can get an insurance elsewhere that is valid and will cover you don't let Car Outlet screw you over with their phony excuse of an insurance that if you're already struggling will certainly land you in the poor house. Â  At the time that I bought the car I was desperate to get a car, what a fool I was getting a car from Car Outlet. Let me start with, this car ended up costing me after the crazy interest rate (which the sales person said would be lower, he wrote it on the paper, but it turned out to be much higher, like I said I was a fool.) Started paying in 2013 and after the 4 years of finishing paying off a 2004 (it is now going to be 2017) Chevy Trailblazer cost me $20,000! For a car that is now worth around $2,500.

Please learn from my foolishness/experience and shop. Elsewhere.",2434,486,487,0,"In latter September, I purchased a 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe intended to accommodate various HAM radio support functions IÂ’m involved in.Â  I installed a second battery along with the wires needed to mount a HAM radio under the back seat, but was leery about running the wires myself, as IÂ’ve not had sufficient experience in doing such work.Â  At this point I need to make it clear that IÂ’ve used the vehicle for a few weeks, and have had ample time to make sure that pretty much everything is in good working order.Â  On October 2nd, I went to a meeting to discuss a recent success in supporting a 100 mile marathon.Â  Prior to the meeting, I stopped by Car Toys on SE 82nd Ave in Portland and initially talked to Parke Arnold, one of their sales people, to find out how much it would cost to have them run the wires for me.Â  The tech explained that rather than try to run them through the firewall, and down under the center console, it would be easier and just as clean to run them along the doors.Â  I was quoted $65.00 for labor and $6.50 for parts to complete the job, and it would take about an hour. As I live a considerable distance from the SE 82nd Ave store, I decided to go to the closer store at 12195 SW Canyon Rd in Beaverton.Â  I drove down on October 3rd to have the installation completed.Â  The person I talked to told me it would cost $93.00 an hour for a little over an hour to complete the job.Â  I mentioned that IÂ’d had a quote from the SE 82nd Ave store for $71.50 for the complete job.Â  The salesperson seemed a little uncomfortable, and talked to an installer, then told me he would talk to the manager.Â  We agreed on a total installation cost of $75.00.Â  I wasnÂ’t as comfortable with the installers at this store, as they seemed a little unsure of the time it would take, but decided to have them do it anyway as I was going to need the vehicle to provide support for another marathon. The installation seemed to go well, and later that day I completed the installation and setup of the HAM radio I purchased to install in the vehicle.Â  The following day (Sunday) I got up early to get to my support location on time.Â  When I arrived at my location, I went to turn the headlights off, and to my surprise, the knob had been pressed into the dash to the point where I could not easily turn the headlights off.Â  I had to pull the knob out in order to turn it and turn the headlights off (keep in mind that the headlight switch is right next to the area where the wires would have been pulled through the firewall).Â  As IÂ’ve had to perform the same task several times on the previous marathon support, I know for a fact that the light switch was in good working order prior to having the wires run. I took the vehicle back to the Canyon Rd store to ask what could be done about the issue.Â  An installation technician came out to look at it with a salesman and immediately told me that it could not possibly have been the installers as they would not have worked around the switch. I mentioned that they would have had to get under the dash right next to it in order to get the wires through.Â  He still insisted that they could not have been responsible for the damage.Â  I went back into the store to discuss the issue with the manager, and was told he was in the bathroom and would be available shortly.Â  I was asked for the invoice, and provided it.Â  The salesperson stapled the cards of the installation manager and assistant store manager to my invoice and told me that one or the other of them would call me that day (two days ago).Â  IÂ’ve not heard anything back, and at this point IÂ’m not sure that I will.Â  It would seem that the management is taking the word of the installers over me, which I donÂ’t think is very good customer service.Â  I will wait a few more days and see if I am contacted before trying anything.Â  In the meantime, it would seem appropriate to publicize the facts of this case.",2435,488,489,2,"On Tuesday I called in reference to a jeep that was on offer up for 750.00.

The first time I felt a little suspicious of them was when they told me my e-break had gotten stuck and broken...also ruining my rotors. I took it to another shop and they couldn't find anything wrong. To this day....it is fine. My husband said maybe he got us confused with another customer... we let it slide. Fast forward to April. We have them do our 100K service. Tell him to do whatever it says is recommended. So timing belt, flushes... told him to do it all. Now, 8 months later... one of my friends is driving the car down the highway. Loud crashing sound and the car stops. The tow truck guy says the timing belt broke in his opinion. I call Bob and ask him if that was something covered by the 12 month warranty provided on the belt and service performed. He immediately says...we didn't replace the water pump. Ummm... ok. So I ask if he sees the service and he said yes we had it done in April. The belt was changed but not the water pump. He said it wasn't recommended. Every google search I have done says that is recommended for the water pump and belt to be done at the same time. That is not the issue however. He tells us it's the idler pulley, it locked up causing the belt to melt and break. He will have to do a $1200 repair before he can tell me if there is damage to the motor. I trust him...we have done business for years. I say ok. Then he tells us after that there is about $3000 more in damage he can't fix. That will be $1200. My husband calls a buddy of his trying to unload the car. He has a car lot and we were thinking a mechanic may want to buy the car as a project car. He tells us Bob should have known that there was guaranteed damage from her driving 70 miles per hour when it broke. Then tells me that $1200 seems really high... we email him a receipt. While I wait to hear back I get in touch with Mitsubishi....a certified Mitsubishi mechanic tells me that not only did he over charge but it was by about $600... he charges double what the dealership does. Then I notice our receipt... a timing belt component kit... then we were also charged for each component individually. Nice. The next day I get an email from my friendÂ’s buddy, same estimate... $600. Both agree he should have never done the work anyway because there was 100% chance the engine was damaged. They both recommended replacing the motor. Both are suspicious that this should have been a warranty issue. I am told to ask for the parts he bought and receipts for them. Legally he has to provide these. He brings some of the parts (NO WATER PUMP IN TH BOX) He tells us he will not provide the part receipts because he doesn't have to let us see the wholesale pricing he gets. The receipt for the 100 K service? He has a hard time finding (Strangely on day one he pulled it up in seconds while we are on the phone) OH wait he found it... gives it to my husband. Looking over it I notice it is an estimate... not an invoice and it was typed up TODAY. I call him he stutters a bit and said its a list of what they did. I tell him I need the actual receipt,.. The one I signed? If there is a Component kit on there he is liable for all of it and he knows it|. He can't find it/. I send my husband up there to get him to look on the computer in front of him. Him and his friend walk in and there are shredding noises coming from Bob's office. That's reassuring'. So, then to top it off they broke the handle on the driver side. Apparently there was a crack in it... Funny. I never saw one before. So now I have a ruined motor and a broken driver side handle so you can't even get into the car. Thanks Bob... your receipt says Honesty, Accuracy, and Quality... Lies. I feel even worse as I don't even know how many of my friends and family he has ripped off. I referred him to everyone, SADÂ… I am now replacing the water pump he put in, supposedly new. The guy replacing my motor said he would not guarantee the work if I didn't because the one Bob put in is covered in sealant and leaking. Being as the car hasn't been started since he put it in he couldn't have put in a new one. Also, he told us the $1200 repair was the only way to know if I had engine damage. Mitsubishi recommends a compression test, SADÂ… My handle he told my husband was cracked and that is how it broke in their care...he told the BBB it was broken before he got it. I am trying to track down the tow guy to testify that it was not broken. Also, I have the girl that was driving the car that day (not me) as a witness. When I called him about the water pump he told me he had no interest in talking to me. I am building a case to take him to court. I have the water pump and video of the work being done to repair the damage they caused. I have done business with him for years... sent everyone I knew to him.

I am a nurse practitioner in practice for more than 14 years. I work with a physician who operates a busy medical SPA so this training was very important to me. This was advertised by the Aesthetics Medical Educators Training as the most intensive program available compared to all the others. I didnÂ’t pay for the course but I was the one who did all the research and my doctor paid for all of this, including my travel and hotel. I feel horrified and responsible because I told him this was the best course out there, based on the website. He trusted my judgment. Next time I am going to look for videos from people who actually attended the course, not just what I read in print. They have a detailed package explaining why they are different and how much better their training is. The course was a complete joke, I feel violated and ripped off that I believed their advertising. The instructor was poorly trained himself and when he talked about Botox Cosmetic, he was not able to intelligently compare the product to either Xeomin or Dysport, which theyÂ advertiseÂ we would also receive training on. They had comparison chartsÂ but, when asked about one of the products, the instructor told me to Â“just look in the bookÂ”,Â itÂ’sÂ all there. The other students in the class were equally surprised by the ridiculous, retarded answers this instructor continued to give the students. It became clearÂ during the didactic training that the instructor just memorized the slides and was not qualified to teach others. They advertised that their instructors are experienced and top notched plastic surgeons, dermatologists and other experts, but the instructor we have should not be teaching anything in Aesthetics. The hands on in the afternoon was a ZOO! They spent more time trying to collect fees from the volunteers and get them organized then with teaching the students in the class. I learned very little during the hands on because it was too crowded, unorganized, too loud and most importantly, the instructor himself was NOT QUALIFIED to teach and knew very little. I left with none of the Â“pearlsÂ” that they talk about in their website. I doubt whether or not the instructor even practices Aesthetics at all in his practice. What a waste of time, and money, the courses were not cheap either, Thanks a lot Aesthetic Medical Educators Training for the rip off course you deliver.Â ",2450,504,505,1,"I too have a complaint about Aesthetic Solutions in Red Deer, AB. I wish I would have done my research and found out about their shady practices before I went for cosmetic lasers.Â I had Affirm and XPL done by Lynette Curr. Marianne Badenhorst assured me she is/was well qualified and that no scarring or anything bad could happen.Â As a result of these procedures I have DNA and nerve damage (for which I have just finished 4 wks of very expensive Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatments to try and fix, to no avail), thermal cellular injury, burns, rolling, boxcar, ice-pick, atrophic and hypertrophic scarring. As well as irreversible chromosomal damage, active thermal bystander effect, fibroblast and elastin damage, cellular necrosis/apoptosis that hasÂ extendedÂ Â from the epidermis into the papillary and reticular dermis, melasma, nose bleeds, pain in my facial bones, hypo-pigmentation, eyebrow, eyelash and hair loss, ringing in ears, chronically dry eyes and blurred vision, chronically dry skin on my face, itchy skin and so many other Â dishearteningÂ things! I have been diagnosed by my GP, dermatologist and a specialist. In no way was I told that these things would happen...nothing about scarring or burns or nerve damage, etc.Â That's not to mention what it has done to me mentally and emotionally! I no longer leave my house unless I absolutely have to see my doctor and I have groceries delivered. I have been trying to find a plastic surgeon to see if there is anything that can be done. I found Dr. Kirsten Westburg in Red Deer, but she refuses to try to fix their mess because she is in league with Aesthetic Solutions as she sends patients to them for lasers!Â The only plastic surgeon that has been willing to try to fix the extensive damage is a Dr. Nathan Newman in California, but at $20,000 it doesn't look like I'll be getting any help any time soon. Please heed my warning... I advise, from my ownÂ experience, do not go to Aesthetic Solutions in Red Deer, you will regret it and more!!!Â ",2451,505,506,1,"I too was 'duped' by the promise of better, younger looking skin. Marianne told me I was a perfect candidate for Affirm laser. I was dazzled by the blatant lies they told me. I had 2 Affirm lasers and one XPL. I was told.... you have the perfect skin for a high setting on this/these lasers. I'm obviously cutting this story very short.Â  Lynette Curr did the 'procedures' on me. She talked about how her and the others get these done all the time. Â What a load!!! Â She told me how to take care of my skin post-procedure, which I followed exactly! I moisturized, moisturized, moisturized... but it doesn't matter how much you moisturize after having such damaging heat go beyond the skin down to the muscle and bone.Â  After a couple of months my skin started to split apart!!! I complained, and they also told me to come back and have an Erbium laser done to correct what had happened. Isn't that an admittance to what they did wrong?! In my opinion, it is. I wanted my money back, but you can probably guess how that went! Needless to say, the skin on my face now covered with very large pores, deep, deep lines, sagging skin, stretch marks, atrophic scars, rolling scars, ice-pick scars and box-car scars. This is beyond disheartening. There are no words to describe how I feel. I look like someone took a knife to my face and made slices to it. It is literally devastating! I too went to my doctor and dermatologist looking for answers and they are very careful right now not to say too much. I have no answers as to what to do.Â  After my personal experience, I'd advise anyone that is thinking of having a laser treatment done...DON'T!!! You will regret it! It is my belief that all lasers will eventually 'fast-track' your aging process and more!Â  If I had known the kind of damage these money-hungry (in my opinion) people are willing to inflict on others, I would have stuck with facials!

After many years and many entered contests I was finally going to just about give up until a few months ago I was contacted by a non-profit company that told me that if I had gotten all the basic dentistry work done by a insurance dentist locally that I had qualified for a makeover and that a advocacy group could get my services paid for. After I got all my teeth take out that the most expensive part was the extractions and consideration of such medical issues would be enough to qualify for the implants needed at no coast to myself so I proceeded to get this accomplished now after all this the same advocate agency told me that because I didn't have between 5000 and 10000 thousand dollars that I had no longer qualified and that my application would be no longer valid I'm now stuck with this If you have any suggestions for my current position please contact this postÂ Thank you for your time and understanding Sincerely.Â ,2454,508,509,1,"Before having surgery, I had some very important concerns.Â  One was, would there be a doctor where I live (post op) in case there were any problems since it would be difficult to get back to Florida often.Â  The answer was YES.Â  The second concern was if the surgery did NOT turn out right, would the Doctor correct it, again the answer was YES.Â  I was told that he would NEVER abandon his patients, well, after the surgery and the problems began, I called the office and they told me send pictures which I did, they assured all was normal.Â  A week later I still had problems they again told me to send pictures, the answers I got was either, they canÂ’t see the problems in the photos or everything is normal and all will resolve.Â  After so many phone calls and pictures emailed to them I finally went back to Florida where the Doctor assured me that all will resolve\, needless to say over a year later and 30 or more phone calls to him and emails to him the problems STILL EXIST and the Doctor refuses to do anything to correct them.Â  He refuses to even see me, forcing me to seek another doctor who immediately saw the problems, said the surgery looked OFF and knew that this surgery was done by Dr. Cooper since many of his patients seek corrective surgery with these same problems.

I know when it comes to needing dental work, one can get desperate. On March 22,2018Â I found their info online and decided to apply because I figured it couldn't hurt. Desperate times call for desperate measures am i right? So I filled out the application and received a call within half an hour. I was unable to answer, so they left a voicemailÂ asking me to call back to conduct an interview. I received an email as well, letting me know they left a voicemail. I was to call back for a woman named Bita Davis. I called back and she wasn't available, so we set up an appointment for a call the next day at 1:15pm but was advised that if I didn't hear from them, to call around that time anyway. Well the next day rolls around and no call from them, so I call in. I am placed on hold for 10 minutes and in that time, three other people come on and tell me to hold, as if they didn't keep track of the calls or like it was a call center where the calls were answered by everyone in general and they didn't keep track of who they had already placed on hold. Someone finally answers and quickly hangs up before I could get a word out. I call back and explained I was hung up on, she was very polite, told me she would check to see if Bita was available. She immediately comes back and says Bita is on another line setting up another customer but that she could assist me. (I didn't get her name) She proceeded to explain that I would be going to a local dentist and that there is an initial fee of $50 to set up an appointment. She stated it was just a precautionary measure because there are a lot of no-shows. She explained I would pay the $50, set up an appointment, go in and get checked, and the dentist would come up with a treatment plan that we can both agree on. he would then submit that to Cosmetic Dentistry grants for approval. I explained that I didn't have the 50 now so I would have to call back. She let me know that was fine and to just call back Monday and offered to set up an appointment.Â She offered a fewÂ time and seemed irritated when i explained I worked 8-5 and could onlyÂ speak to them from 1-2pm. I then explainedÂ I wouldnÂ’t have the deposit on Monday but can call her Friday. This is when her politeness took a turn for the worst.Â She stated I had to call Monday. That she needed the deposit by then in order to keep my account open or she would have to close it.

I'll just start off with: Once upon a time a Laser Hair removal device was purchased for what was a fair market price from Sam Lehrer's Laser Outlet. Shipment was received and along came instructions that the use of a jim clip or more commonly known as a paper clip to jimmy the unit for normal use would be necessary (after all, it is used). After further evaluation, we've found that this is in violation of use as it is not in working order. In this diminished capacity, the unit worked for a short few months before it became apparent that the unit needed some service. When cleaned by a professional servicing company, a brown sludge was found inside of the unit. They also reiterated that using it in its current state was ill-advised. Sam Lehrer was contacted for replacement. That replacement never came. No compensation, concessions or rebates for the monies paid came either.Â A lawsuit was filed and many transactions between Attorneys transpired. Unfortunately, due the nature of the expenditure, after failed attempts at a resolution, I made the decision that this would not be economically feasible to continue... litigation for restitution might cost me more than I had initially paid for the device. I pulled the plug on the lawsuit. This is my first attempt at relaying the facts of my story. I am not here to mud sling, but to add just another story of the fraud that has been obviouslyÂ perpetrated, evidenced by the 1st page of googling Sam Lehrer Laser.Â I believe there is enough negative press and complaints online that anyone considering doing business with this individual would be for-warned of the likelihood of a bad experience. I am using an alias, because who knows how far a fraud might go to try and retaliate or scream libel from the rooftops (or on an internet message boards~ to be more specific). We can all use our reason and common sense to agree that someone that has to constantly defend their position is, at the very least, suspect. I'm not interested in a fight, I already went the route of trying to do this in a legal manner with which my Attorney was met with outrageous claims of asset redistribution to the tune of 4 Million in earnings from one year to running a business at a loss the next. The name of the company continues to change, but OZ behind the curtain remains Sam Lehrer.Sam, as I'm sure you'll probably read: The truth doesn't have to explain itself. The TRUTH just IS.",2459,514,515,1,"Malti O'Mahoney, James Anthony O'Mahoney and Peter Anthony Grant run a Phoenix Company Anyone thinking of going to this clinic think twice, and think hard.Â In December 2005 after returning from Thailand where I had been living I had a series of laser hair removal sessions in Thailand due to the low cost. The treatments were near completion when I returned to the UK.Â I was, at the time, living close by and found what was then called Boston Clinic at a slightly different address om Moscow RD (same owners) and I enquired about whether they could finish my treatments, which were maybe 1-3 left for complete hair removal. They told me they absolutely could help me and I went for my first treatment with a technician that did a decent job. My second appointment came and then technician advised me that as my hair was so fine it was best for me to use the Lumenis Lightsheer (diode) laser to complete my treatments. I agreed to a patch test.Â I came back and reported that while there were no adverse reactions I did not see a better result than I had with the other laser, safer for my skin type. I chose to proceed with the treatment. During the treatment I felt excruciating pain on my legs as the technician did my treatment. I immediately told her and she said, YOU JUST HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN, I WILL ONLY DO ONE PASS. Around 10 minutes later I felt even worse burning and noted welts up and down my legs which started to blister. I again brought this up to the technician who told me that, THIS HAPPENS SOMETIMES, DO NOT WORRY.Â I left with instructions to use lavender they tried to sell me to put on the wounds. In the coming days the blisters started to ooze and get worse. I could not sleep, I could not shower as it hurt me so much. I called and reported this to the clinic, they told me not to worry. I was worried, I went to a specialist dermatologist in Berlin Germany and was told I had severe burns and would result in permanent scarring.Â I wrote my own demand letter to the clinic and was told Malti O'Mahoney would discuss it with me. On the phone she agreed it was bad and she agreed I deserved some compensation and that they had in fact burnt me. They never offered anything as I was told she needed to speak with the owner, subsequently I found out that was her husband James O'Mahoney and he decided that he did not want to discuss compensation. I got in touch with a man who was not even legal to practice in UK as he was not active but acting as their solicitor and HE ACTUALLY ADVISED ME to get a solicitor telling me his client was not cooperating.Â From 2006-2016 this has dragged on. I was awarded 524,758.93Â UK Sterling for my injuries and losses. I have permanent scarring up and down my legs and have to follow a regimen to try and conceal this.Â If you check the history of Boston Clinic (UK) Ltd and Boston Clinic UK Ltd and now Harley Street Treatments and other names you will see that they have consistently changed their name and dissolved their company with Companies House, which is a joke, to evade this judgement, and presumably other debts and possibly even judgements as their history of changing name and dissolving and re-emerging is so constant. In fact though they never even attended one hearing or defended their actions yet they tried to dissolve themselves mid proceedings and re-form under a slight variation of their name, this was later forced by the courts to be reinstated but to no help to me.Â Though my solicitors have tried to collect the damages I was awarded in the judgement, they have been unsuccessful as the defendant, James O'Mahoney and his wife Malti O'Mahoney and their accountant, Peter Grant, who at the time was a director and destroyed all relevant documents, all ran away from their responsibilities and accountability for their clinic. Â Instead of taking accountability in any form they just dissolve and reform their company over and over, AND I WILL STAY ON TOP OF THAT AND WARN ANYONE I CAN to stay clear of them and make sure you get their medical mal practice insurance details and ensure they have them if you do dare go here for any treatment.Â Quite simply, James Anthony O'Mahoney and Malti O'Mahoney and Peter Grant got away with permanently maiming me and until they pay their debt as ordered by the court, or they cease to exist I will do my best to ensure nobody go through what I had to go through. This is a rogue business and sadly allowed by Companies House to continue to operate and change their name on a regular basis.Â Footnote: In May 2016 they were forced into insolvency and dissolved and now rather than Harley Street Treatments Limited they are Harley Street Treatments Ltd and now the director is listed as Peter Anthony Grant once again.Â STAY AWAY FROM HARLEY STREET TREATMENTS.",2460,515,516,1,"Had a facelift 9 months ago with Dr. Jan Zemplenyi, Bellevue, WA.Â  My facelift results are horrific.Â  Part of my ear (the tragus) was completely cut off on one side and instead of doing a fat grafting procedure which he suggested doing because my face was thin, he removed part of my buccal (cheek) fat or tissue creating a large divot on my cheek which causes my face on one side to look like a skeleton.Â  He pulled one side of my face extremely tight and left one side loose and saggy.

The surgery took him four hours longer than he said it would (10 to 11 hours total).Â  He was supposed to collect the rib cartilage via a 1/4 inch incision under my pectoral muscle like good surgeons do.Â  Instead, he cuts a 2 to 2 1/2 inch incision straight through my top left abdominal muscle.Â  Recovering from this was more painful than the nose reconstruction itself. When he took the bandage off my nose it was HUGE.Â  I mean I looked scary.Â  I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror.Â  The swelling has gone down a lot since then, but my nose is still very big and bulky.Â  The tip of my nose is a big glob of cartilage, the right side of the nose is lower than the left side.Â  Here I am a year and a half later and my nose looks worse than before the surgery.

They make it sound like everything is perfect with their mobile homes. They sell Marlette Schult mobile homes. I have nothing but problems with this company. This company is a bunch of scam artists. They refuse to take any kind of responsibility for any unfinished work, damaged items, or warranty items needing fixed. They are very good about getting out of fixing their mistakes. Just a couple examples: 1. Unfinished trim work that needed fixed was done very poorly. We still have cracks in the ceiling that still haven't been fixed. Another example 2. Carpeting that is not tacked down completely or lined up correctly. They still haven't fixed it, excuse is that they fired the guy who does the carpeting. 3. Frozen water pipes because they never plugged in the heating wrap. Reason, they didn't have to plug it in because they installed the home in the summer months. They never told us this at that time so we assumed that it was plugged in and working. Excuse is that it is stated in the manual that they do not have to plug it in. We have never seen this so called manual...the one that they provided for us doesn't state this issue. ...they called and harassed my aunt, with an unlisted number, to find out what was going on in our mobile home. This company is very slippery and gets out of doing anything that they are responsible for. They can't talk big when they get into trouble then they never open their mouths.

My dear friend have recently purchased some 32gb cards which were charge 6 dollars a piece from this company. While they were making the deal, this lady Lisa also agree to send extra 25 pieces as a gift to first time buyer. However, when he received the products, although all the cards will shown as 32GB when he inserted in the computer, but it all turned out to be 2GB only. Also, even though the shipping label and everything was written as 100 pieces, there were only 75 pieces that he received. When he decided to contact the lady Lisa who's in charge, she called him an idiot to think that he could use such a cheap price to get such high quality products! And insisted that she did not lie. My friend has asked and confirmed if the cards are 32GB before he purchased them. Moreover, when we finally come close to making a deal to have the money returned, she requested to have ALL 100 PIECES back, included the 25 pieces which were never received. So he told her that he have contacted her before and told her that he never received that 25 pieces. Instantly, she got extremely mad and started yelling! She insisted that if we do not have all 100 pieces, she will not make any deal unless he agree to have the money taken off from that 25 pieces which appears to be missing. On top of that, she was trying to take money off from shipping, services and such, which leaves only almost a dollar back for each piece instead of all 6 dollars!

Â Two months after purchasing, the plasma screen went, and a signal board went in it. Â Both were covered by the warranty. There are 4 major components in this TV and 2 of them went in the first 2 months of use. All was fine up until September 2009, just under 3 years after purchasing. Â I began getting the dreaded 6-3 error code. Â the logic board bad died and needed to be replaced. Â I had it replaced at a cost of $350 for the part and $70 for the service call. Fast forward 5 months. Â I am getting the 6-3 error code again. Â The logic board has broken again and that part only comes with a 90 day warranty. Â So I essentially threw $350 away the last time I had the TV repaired. Â Philips refuses to replace the $350 5 month old part. Â  My personal feeling is a $350 part should last longer than 5 months and a $1300 TV should last longer than 3 years. Â But Philips feels otherwise. Â They refuse to stand behind their products. Â From what I understand, Philips was having so many problems with these TV's, thousands and thousands of failures, that they stoppedÂ producingÂ them. Â  I am told that they don't even make the parts anymore. Â I could understand that one if the TV was 20 years old, but it is only 3. So the Broken Philips Plasma TV has not been repaired as I am not too keen on shelling out another $350 to fix a TV that May or may not last another 5 months. I have an option. Â Fix the Philips or buy a new one. I purchased a new PANASONIC Tv over the weekend. Â I am done with the Philips brand.

It was our first time doing business and was learning everything as we go. We received a flyer through the mail from Electronic Business Solutions, Inc. at our business location shortly after we registered the business and started setting up the storefront. The flyer was for a credit card acceptance machine (terminal). One of the representative / owner, Curt Hollis, called us shortly after to see if we were interested in having the machine set up in our store. At first we were reluctant since we did not know what the nature of the customers in the area were like, but after talking to the representative and reading over the flyer we decided to meet with him. We asked Mr. Hollis many questions, especially regarding the terms of the contract, he assured us several times that the lease contract was cancelable at any time. The flyer also states that there is, No contracts. Even though the lease agreement we signed after the terminal was set up said that it was non-cancelable. When we asked him this he said that it was a formality to have that on the contract. He said that if the credit card terminal does not help increase our sales we could cancel the contract at any time and that he would just pick up the machine and give it to another business and we would no longer be responsible for the lease nor the credit card machine (terminal). Three months after we had the credit card terminal in our store it was more of an expense then a profit for us to have it around. As we discovered, very few of our customers had credit cards, thus we decided it was inefficient to have the machine or the service in our store. Since about July of 2004 we have been trying to contact the Electronic Business Solutions, Inc just about every other day. We finally gave up after reporting him to the Better Business Bureau in Colorado Springs Colorado. They did not have any success in receiving a reply to the letters that they sent to the company's representative/owner, Curt Hollis, either. This company has approximately twelve complaints against them according to the BBB. Around September of 2004 when we called once more to Electronic Business Solutions, Inc., we were able to speak with one of Curt Hollis employees. We explained the situation to him and he assured us that we were now on the list to have the machine transferred. That was over 8 months ago since we had any contact with the company and now we cannot even get a hold of anyone in his office. We have talked directly with the leasing agent, Allied Financial Investments, Inc. They said that they understood our misfortune, but refuses to accept responsibility for their subcontractor / representative business practices. We are at a point where we are feeling hopeless and that there is nothing we can do. As of April 30, 2005, we have closed our business, but we still have this issue that we have to deal with. We would like to see if there is any way that we can move forward with this.

They sent this machine three times in service center but the results remained the same. The problem arose when we put some load in it.

Long story short, EPS has been ripping us off forÂ 7 full years.Â  (Yes, shame on us!) Overcharged for terminal rental-instead, look for a company that will let you lease to own, or at least explain in plain terms that you will be paying for oldÂ outdated equipment for years and years! Fees are not competitive.Â  Lots of merchant service co's out there with lower rates! Customer service is extremely rude and does not provide service, just references to your contract while lying to you. Contract terms are unreasonable, even after 6 years, your contract will not allow you to cancel any time you wish.Â  Lots of other co's have a month to month after 1 year of service.Â  Our current co will allow us to cancel any time.Â  In Feb 2009, we realized EPS had been charging us a terminal rental fee that when totaled up over 6 years since our contract began in 2003 was 5x the purchase price of a new terminal.Â  We also realized at that time they were just not competitive enough with their fees and rates to continue doing business with them. If they were a reputable andÂ smart business, at that point they would have offered to give us theÂ 6 year old terminal with a big thank you for your business and for overpaying us for the use of the terminal for the pastÂ 6 years.Â Â  They might have kept our business.Â  But, instead, an employeeÂ gotÂ short verbally over the phone whenÂ askedÂ about the obvious disparity in the fees we'd paid and the price of the old terminal, and when she wasÂ told we wished to terminate their services (7 years),Â she got even nastier, and informed us that our contract automatically renewed every September for an entire year.Â  So, we could no terminate as we wished.Â  There was no Sorry to see you go, are you sure there is nothing we can do?Â  So much for good business and excellent public relations... She then LIED, (sorry, but I can't really minimize this to say she mis-spoke, which seems to be the new PC term for lying!), and stated that a written request to terminate the contract would not be accepted until we were within 90 days of renewal.Â Â  That was in Feb, and our renewal month was September.Â  I went over the requirements carefully with her, and she told me to write the letter after July 1st.Â  At that time, we had no reason not to believe her, and alas, we did not look at our contract, or we would have realized the lie right away, and discovered that the written request was to be received before 90 days of renewal date.Â Â  So, then weÂ put up with their monthly charge being withdrawn from our checking account every month, and waited until July to send in the written request, (which was sent certified mail)Â for terminating our contract in September, 2009.Â  But, afterÂ taking the Sept fee out of our account, we were told tough luck, you should have read your contract.Â  So, of course, we were then ripped off for an additional $505 for the next year.Â  This tactic, or twisting of verbiage is, we feel,Â something their agentsÂ may actually beÂ trained to say, so that people are mislead into carrying another full year complete with annual and monthly charges above their competitors.Â  This is how they are able to stay in business, by making it so hard to terminate them, that they just take money out of their customers accounts instead of truly competing for business.

She kept saying this is not their error so the charge is valid, and I kept saying this is not my error either because simply I didn't receive the first bill. Even though the mistake was not made by me, I realized that getting these charges waived was impossible. And also the experience to deal with these bank employees was the worst I can remember now.

This was posted back in July, and still we've got nothing. Second are the exclusive monthly contests. Out of the 11 months Music Today has been running Xposed, we've had 5 contests.

I originally called to check on a couple of used pianos that seemed good but they had NONE of them available because they were all sold, he said. Jim promptly tried to sell me a different piano (new) and the price seemed good so I ordered one. The piano was shipped because I was in a different state. The day after I received it several keys were getting stuck. I called Jim right away and he said it was because it was new and told me to wiggle the keys to see if it makes it better. I did but it didn't help. Since the first tuning was included, we thought that will fix the problem so waited 3 weeks for the tuner to come. The problem persisted after the tuning session but we just got by thinking it will get better as parts wear. After months the problem didn't go away so we hired our regular tuner to tune it. He found out that there was a problem with the hammer action that was preventing the hammers to get back into ready position after repeatedly hitting certain keys. I called Jim and he refused to believe that it was a faulty piano. I told him what my tuner told me and he asked for the tuner's phone number, told me that he would talk to him and call me back. So, I waited until his promised date but didn't get a call back so I called him and he said he will have the piano exchanged. I asked him if a trade-up to a different piano was possible and he said yes. I'd seen a couple of used Yamahas and Kawais on their site so I asked about them and NONE of them are available. He says he will be getting a new shipment from Japan in a couple of weeks and there's one 30 year old Yamaha that's priced a grand more than what I bought. He said it's either that or a direct replacement of the broken piano. I wasn't about to pay a grand more for a used piano so I said just go ahead and send the replacement.

Why advertise on Ebay when you don't have the product?3. Jim never got back to me as he promised. I always had to call him back and he got angry at me for calling him too often. and we had an argument.

Nowhere did I ever see anything stating I would be charged twice. The billing department was not very helpful and was actually rude. I will NEVER order from them again.",2511,572,573,0,"In 2013, I called to complain because I had purchased wigs from Paula Young since the 70's and had the Adelaide wig for a long time. Then they were no longer true to size so I was asked to return the wigs to Specialty Commerce Co Customer Support. Never heard back from them so I switched to the Trisha Wig. This past month 11/2015 I ordered it on the website and the color was not available. Then I checked the catalog and called and they said it was an error on the website. I returned and received the correct color. Now, the large no longer covers my hairline and the hair itself is much shorter. Not at all true to the ad in the catalog. I was also told the website would be fixed for the color error and has still not been fixed. Paula Young apparently was not great motivated to talk to me on the phone.
Updated on 05/26/2016: I received a phone call the very next day and was informed that they were having issues with the Trisha wig. I received credit for the return and also received free shipping on the Naples that I chose to use in the meantime. I was also given a number to call her back if I had problems with the Naples. Since the Naples has more hair and also a little longer than the Trisha, I thought I would call that number and find out if the issue with the Trisha had been resolved. Previously, when I had called the number and asked for Latonya, I was able to leave a message and she returned my call. This time I was asked which department, and I told her the situation and I didn't know the department. Maybe it was someone in Customer Service. I was transferred and they didn't know Latonya but looked at my account and said nothing was posted as to my previous conversation with Latonya.
They tried to transfer or get some information for me but were unable and then asked if they could help me with anything or if I would like to place an order. I said that I didn't want to order and have to return unless I knew that the issue with the Trisha had been resolved. They were not able to tell me other than maybe the next batch of them that they received might be correct. Apparently, they do not follow up to see if the size or length has been corrected. The only good thing I can say is that someone did contact me originally and they do finally have the color added on their website. I recently looked to see the new wigs they mentioned to see if I could find a different one and now I keep getting emails regarding that, asking if I found anything or if they could help me. IÂ’m waiting to be helped, but not for long timeÂ…",2512,573,574,1,"Never in all my life have I seen such incompetance from a company.

It arrived in sub-standard condition.Â It was defective in the following ways (get ready forÂ  this) ahem.Â 1/The nut on the guitar was so sharp ot cut my han on first use. 2/It had obviously experienced a humidity drop resulting in fretboard shrinkage, overhanging frets and achange in shape of the neck. This rendered the guitar impossible to tune. 3/The printing on the toogle switch surround plate was smudged. 4/The saddle of the G-string was incorrectly filed sitting too high and put of sync with the others. 5/The free gig bag zip was broken.Since then(9/12/13) i was ignored other than one phone call. When i contacted the Canadian distibutor, whose manager (Mike Holman) was a gentleman, this poor guy didn't know what to think. On one hand they're telling him they've communicated with me and lying about it and on the other is me just wanting someone to listen.

The vet has sent three copies of the bill and his report about the office visit but the insurance company refuses to acknowledge that fact. They have stalled on reimbursement (only 80% and $200.00 deductible) long enough to get a second Premium payment out of me.

While I was there, I saw a fiddler crab, but I didn't know how to care for him. The sales associate told me that the crab would be just fine in the freshwater. So I bought them both. Very excited, I took them home and floated their bags so they would get used to the water. This was around 2:00 p.m. About an hour later, I noticed the fiddler crab was moving slowly, and spending lots of time sitting still. I researched them online and found, to my dismay, that they are brackish water animals. Not only that, but many pet stores keep them in freshwater, which greatly weakens them and shortens their lifespan. Sadly, the fiddler crab died about 2 hours later, in spite of my efforts to save him. I called the store and they admitted that they put a little salt in the water, but failed to tell me. Needless to say, I was disappointed and angry. Imagine my surprise when I checked the placo a little while later, and he was dead too!! I don't know what they are doing, but whatever it is, it is terrible for these little animals.

Two weeks after I placed the order, I still had not received the products. When I first contacted the company (by email and phone), I was informed that they were Â“doing maintenanceÂ” on their system and they could not help me at this time. In addition, their website was down for maintenance. I was also told that shipment usually takes 10 to 14 business days. What I had not realized at the time I was placing the order is that they are located in China!! There was no indication on their website as to where they are located. I only figured this out because my bank charged me an international transaction fee. A couple of days later, I checked their website again and noticed that Â“they were up and runningÂ” again. I send them another email asking about my order. They told me once again that it had been sent. When I asked for the carrier information and tracking number, I was informed that they did not have that information because they sent the package by Â“mail.Â” Instead they told me that they would re-send the order. In the same email, they mentioned that I should contact my local post office to find out where the package was. Furthermore, I was informed that once I receive the Â“originalÂ” order, I was to return it to them in order to avoid being charged again. I have never had to deal with a company that does not track their shipments. Nor have I ever experienced customer service that is so ridiculously inept.

Everyone of them I've found to be grossly more expensive than other vets in the area (2X-3X more!) After 2 of my cats ended up racking up some pretty large bills at my vet for various things. Â I was looking closely at my receipt to see that I was receiving all of the discounts that I was suppose to, having been a loyal Pet Assure customer for some 3 odd years.I saw a lot of discrepancies such as a $392.56 bill on one of my cats visits only being discounted $31.44 (not even 10%) all of it was In-house medical perhaps minus a $6.00 medical waste disposal feeI had another cat with an upper respiratory go in for a check up/exam visit and a nail trim. Bill was $133.00 (minus $26 for a take-home prescription & medical waste disposal fee, so $107.00) I received NO Pet Assure discount for her, so I guess Doctor Visit Extended and Nail Trim don't constitute as discountable? The website sure says different. I should have received a $26.75 discount (25% off $107.00), but I received nothing. Â Â So with both of these troubling bills and the vet unwilling to work with me. I contacted Pet Assure for assistance. I faxed her the bills and upon first seeing them agreed that it looked like there were quite a few errors made and that she'd contact the vet and see what she could work out. I was pleased at this point. Then she got back with me and said that every questionable undiscounted item she brought up was defended by the vet and that they made very good points, stating that they would be out of business if they were to take off all this money and that they have competitive prices for the area.. Ummm so you can't honor things that pet assure's website lists as you should be covering because you'll be losing so much money you'd have to shut down. And that constitutes a fair reason? And the most ludicrous part is that she sided with them and said that they seem for the most part to be applying the Pet Assure discount approprotely, that they haven't received any other complaints from Pet Assure members about that particular vet and there's nothing they can do to help me in fighting for my correct discount.Â I ended up losing thousands of dollars at over-priced participating Pet Assure vets that did not discount properly and got crappy support from Pet Assure. (Just as an example I got a quote from the Pet Assure associated vet for $1500.00 to remove my cat's eye. After seeing how little Pet Assure was willing to fight for me, I shopped around at other vets nearby and found 1 other vet with a quote under $1000 & 2 other vets with quotes under $700! I ended up paying $640 and that included his take home medication that the vet wanting $1500 would have charged an extra $200 for! Â It's really a disgrace that Pet Assure would in a sense sponsor vets that are as overpriced as they are and then the vets are't even discounting properly and Pet Assure can't help.

My Girlfriend saw a little white one and wanted that one, so i asked the store employee if the gerbil was treated for major diseases and where they came from. At that time I was assured that they were quality gerbils and all in good health. I got the gerbil home and put him in a new cage that I had bought him. I work nights so sometimes its hard for me to always notice everything, but three days later before i went to work I was changing their water and food and noticed he would not open his eyes and didnÂ’t run from my hand like normal. So I gave him some vitamins and went to work, well while I was at work he passed away. At that time I still had to work the next few nights so I didnÂ’t have time to call the store and get the problem resolved.

She was very rude and had no remorse for either gerbil that had passed away and lied to me telling me that they treat for Wet and Dry Tail Disease every morning. She refused to give me a refund for the gerbil because I did not call a week after I had bought him. I missed by 12 Hours.

The insurance would protect me should the cats have medical problems. So I called the company they recommended - PetFirst. At no time did anyone from PetFirst say anything about pre-existing conditions or worming being excluded. I was told only that the insurance did not include wellness care which I felt was very appropriate. It didn't take long before I realized that I had adopted both cats with a pre-existing problem. One tested positive for roundworms so both were treated. Even after treatment, both had loose stools with some bright red blood in the litter box. In other ways, the cats were healthy. I didn't try to submit a claim until 8 months later when the problem was persisting, and I had already incurred several hundred dollars in vet bills. The cats were given worming medicine again as a precaution even though their previous culture was negative. PetFirst denied all payment on the claim, insisting that it was a pre-existing illness, was routine care (nail cutting was included on the same bill), and that worming was not included. They must have all these rules in their fine print but they certainly don't tell you when they sign you up. And they knew these cats were adopted from a shelter which made them high risk. At the very least, this company is highly unethical and it may be fraud since they do not disclose very important terms and conditions and are signing you up over the phone even before you can't see and review their policy which arrives by mail several weeks later. And they made a point of reviewing normal exclusions on the phone. Then when you really need the insurance, they conveniently have a reason hidden in their exclusions to deny theÂ claim and this is probably after you have paid their premiums for quite some time (as I did).

Anna assured me that both the mother and father of this dog were hers and that she bred them personally. Since then, I have had nothing, but problems and the dog was sick from the get-go. Not long after buying it, it was confirmed by my vet that the dog had an internal parasite, so bad that he had to have had it since birth. Upon learning this, I called Anna to discuss. The truth then came out that she only had the mother and that the father was someone else's dog. I asked if the mother was the Maltese or the Poodle and what the father was and she completely ignored me and moved on to another topic. At that point, she stood by her vet's diagnosis of the dog at the time of purchase...which was the picture of health (she claims!). I asked her if I could have the name of the vet and his phone # to speak to him personally and she, once again, completely ignored me and moved on to another topic. More recently, I had the dog in the emergency room at the vet last week due to a hip injury and, after a series of x-rays, it was determined that the dog has a hereditary bone disorder in which the knees don't sit properly in the socket. The condition is ranked on a scale between 1-4, with 4 being the most severe. The dog was diagnosed between a 3-4, making him a candidate for orthoscopic surgery. This condition also leads into severe arthritis. Being a hereditary disorder, the mother and/or the father had it and, knowing this, breeders are not to breed those dogs. I called her last week to discuss it and Anna proceeded to call me every name in the book, threatened me with bodily harm, to hook me up to the back end of her Hummer and drag my up and down Firestone Boulevard, and threatened to put me in the hospital. I told her I was bringing the dog back to her and I wanted my money back and, if not, I would see her in Court. She told me my b***s weren't big enough and that this was her world and I lived in it. I then called the Sherrif's Department and told them what happened and that she threatened me. I took the dog back that day (with police escort) and, conveniently, she was not there. The Sherrif spoke to her on the phone in which she proceeded to call me every name in the book...again and told him how psycho I and my vets are. I left the dog there, was given a receipt on a scrap of paper by her worker and left. She called my husband that night and told him the dog was ready for pick-up and that he was in perfect health and had been checked out by her vet after we left. My husband asked if he could have the name and # of the vet and was told he could get that info when he picked the dog up the next day (Friday). My daughter called for me the next day and spoke to Anna and asked if Anna could fax the vet paperwork to her so we could speak to the vet personally. Anna, once again, said we could get that info when we picked the dog up on Tuesday after the President's Day holiday (it was supposed to be that day!). At that point, my daughter told her that we were not picking up the dog at all and that we would see her in Court. Anna then showed her true self and proceeded to cuss my daughter out and said she knows how this game is played (obviously, she's been here before with other clients!). Since then, we have found out that there is no vet - she gives all shots and self-diagnoses the animals herself. She also does not breed these dogs herself - she gets them all from puppy mills and passes them off to be affluent breeds. Anna Gabriel needs to be shut down! She not only goes by Anna Gabriel and Norwalk Pet Grooming, but also by...Anna Beradini, Anna Bernadini, Anna M.

They also found several SICK puppies that she was treating without vet supervision or prescription! Anna pleaded not guilty though that was her plea, she was sentenced to 6 months probation. Obviously the state thought differently. In 1999 American Kennel Club yanked her registration privileges for not identifying her dogs properly and not keeping good records and was sentenced to 10 years of no registrations. And just recently on June 16th of 2005 Anna was under the watchful eye again. L. A.

Â My recent claim for allergy-related testing was denied based on the fact that my puppy was seen for a hot spot one month before his insurance policy was activated. Hot spots DO NOT always indicate allergy problems. Â He was never seen for any allergy problems for a year following the initial hot spot visit and was never diagnosed with allergies or treated for the problem until several weeks ago. Â I spoke with supervisor Kelly who informed me that Pet Plan denied the claim on the basis that the allergies were a pre-existing condition. My vet stated that hot spots are not always an indication of allergies; they can be caused by many factors. Â It was never noted in my veterinary record that my dog suffered from allergies, nor was any medical treatment prescribed for an allergy problem. Â The fact that my dog never had any problems over the course of the following year should have substantiated the fact that he had no allergy issues. If this had been an allergy issue, he would have been seen again within a year, testing would have been done at that point and medication would have been prescribed. Â None of this happened until a few weeks ago. Â The denial of this claim in unsubstantiated and unacceptable and conveys to me that this company is in fact, deceptive and unscrupulous in its practices.Â  I have cancelled my policy. Â I am a member of the German Shepherd rescue community and professional dog training community, and I will no longer recommend this deceptive company. Â If this company would twist medical diagnosis to benefit them for a small claim such as this, they would most certainly twist facts in an attempt to weasel out of paying for very expensive claims.

Grooming stresses him out, (that is why I thought by paying more for someone to come to my house would be less stressful on my dog). About 30 minutes later I saw the groomer walking around her van. About 30 minutes after that I saw her again walking around her van, talking on the phone. I decided to see what was going on, she had been a my home for an hour already and I didn't like that my dog was left alone unattended in the van up on a table he was tied to. The groomer still talking on the phone then told me she couldn't find her clippers that they must have been stolen. I then took my dog out of the van he had been tied up in for over an hour. The groomer said she was on the phone w/ the office and would let me know what they could work out w/ either rescheduling me or getting her some clippers delivered. 30 minutes later she knocked my door and said I could either reschedule or wait another 15 minutes and someone to deliver clippers to her. She had already been their for an hour and a half. I told her I could not wait any longer, I had other stuff to do. She told me to call the office to reschedule and left. A few minutes after she left the Pet Love office called me to reschedule. I told them I did not wish to reschedule. I was told I would be charged a cancellation fee. I told them I was not happy that it took their groomer over an hour to even let me know she was unable to do the job I had hired them to do. I was only told after they had been at my house for an hour because I went out to the van to see why she was out the van walking around talking on the phone and why my dog was left unattended and tied up in her van.

Wrong. Not with EA Sports which should be renamed EA Scamsters.
After starting to open the packs one after another doubles of the same players was stacked in my bundle. Over and over the same players in the same positions. Literally when done I went and counted the doubles of players which came to a total of 31. This never happened before with me so I went to EA sports customer support and told a girl named Mary the story and all what she could say was, ""Sorry that's how it work and we can do nothing.""

Over the years, the games made by EA Sports have become increasingly ""pay to win"". The 2018 editions of their sports games has been the last straw with me. The games are absolutely loaded with microtransactions. For example, one of my favorite game modes in the Madden series is draft champions. It's a mode where players get to complete a quick draft involving many elite players from current day and from the past. Then players get to play against one another. Really fun I must say.
But, now this year Madden 18 changed draft champions into MUT Champions and now requires 5 tickets to enter each time. What happens when you're out of tickets? Either you play hours of boring solo challenges just hoping that one of the packs you earn contains more tickets. Or, you can pay a nice price of $3 for 5 more tickets. This is absolute **.

Pretty much ruining my opinion on EA entirely and for a company that's supposedly all about their customers this feels like a punch in the face to someone who has purchased EA games since I was a kid.

You can earn coins by playing matches but the amount of matches one would have to play to acquire e.g. Ronaldo would be thousands. In previous versions, items listed on the transfer market were accompanied with a player I.D. so buyers could identify who they were purchasing players from. This feature has now vanished and so EA can simply duplicate player cards/item cards at will. Therefore player prices can be forced up or down at the whim of the game developer.

What is even more appalling, is that there is no actual person to speak to; only automated e-mails that still take days to reach your inbox. It is simply unfathomable that a company can do these things in this day and age.
I have been playing FIFA 17 for 4 years and also enjoyed the experience. This year, like the other years, I loved my time playing. However, one day my account was hacked into and all of my team was sold off. All the hours and money I spent building a team in the game was gone. This was just the beginning. When I attempted to contact EA customer service, they told me to wait and see if it was a glitch with their servers. 20 minutes later, my account was banned; meaning I could not play the game that I paid for any longer. I tried to contact them again, but was told that the Terms of Service department (TOS team) is in charge of the bans and they do not have a phone number. Rather, you have to write an e-mail disputing the account ban.
I did exactly what they told me to do, and provided all the details as well as hard evidence that I did nothing wrong and that all of my items were stolen from me. 4 days later, an automated response comes back saying that the decision to ban my account was final and that the case was closed. No phone number, no reason, no explanation. Simply, I can no longer play a game that I purchased and invest hours and money into. This is how they treat dedicated customers.

I just wonder that the game favor the players that put more money into the game because there seems to be a little, lopsided favoritism and it's kind of frustrating for a game that supposed to be realistic. Again I ask, ""Why have ratings when they mean absolutely nothing?"" Speed catching, trucking, etc. just take the ratings off and just say it's a free-for-all, it don't matter, instead making you think you're getting a better player.

The worst part is I contacted EA Sports multiple times about it and they basically called me a liar!! Like I'm going to waste my precious time to make up some like this!!! I have better things to do than to lie to a bunch of nerds!!! It speaks volumes as to how this company is run!! I own and run a company too and I would never call a customer a liar.

You would think after all these years they could get it right but they obviously are too lazy to put the real work in for change. I am giving it a 1 star because the only things they changed from last year was not for the better but only made to game worse.

They haven't made an honest FIFA since 98, too many buttons, glitches in the players, no tackling prowess, no passing or shooting accuracy. I went to FIFA 15 thinking they would sort all this franchise, all it is is predictive footballing, passes going to the wrong player, can't tackle worth a damn, totally biased toward the computer team, the AI is non existent, fed up of losing games but controlling the games because the glitches in players when they go in for tackles. There's 1 new thing I noticed on 15, you have the ball, you move forward and as you press r1 and triangle for a lobbed through ball, the player stops and lets the ball slightly move forward, but the player stays where he is, so he loses the ball, glitch, glitch, glitch, on all your players.
The change player on manual isÂ…, most of the time it changes to the wrong player, over biasness toward the computer team from the ref. The amount of free kick, penalties he does my team for but their team can hack me down from anywhere, even behind, and no free kick. Please EA you can't write AI for the computer team so you handicap my team to make it not even equal. Before you go into the match, your madden is just as... Do me a favour and bin this franchise once and for all. I hope this gets sent to you because you clearly can't make a non predictive football sim to save your lives. 90% gameplay what a load ofÂ…, minus 100% gameplay. I don't buy your game because it looks good, I buy it in the hope that you will fix this franchise or just bin it. Pro Evo is too! But at least you can tackle on that game.
Any other game maker please make an honest football sim and not this predictive crap. We've been spoon fed since FIFA 2000. EA if you're going to keep making football sims, give us a PlayStation 3 re-make of the brilliant FIFA 98. The computer doesn't beat me with talent. No it up my gameplay, and handicaps my team. Not fair predictive, to watch when you lose 1-0 so many times, and when you look at the read up of the game you've had 12 shots, 8 on target, the computer has 1- shot, 1 on target, or 3-shot 2 on target. Doesn't add up.
Please, please, people do like I have done after buying this last piece of from EA cheats. I don't buy this anymore and I will do my utmost to put all my friends off this cheating predictive footballing franchise. The players even slower than the computers, but out of it all the tackling is total rubbish.

No wonder I heard you delete all bad reviews of your crap so that people will keep buying this shit!!!",3553,614,615,1,"I've played FIFA all my life and I'm fed up at this point. The game is so inconsistent. I've tried and tried to just forget it and move past it but honestly it's.... Why is my goalie sliding on his butt moving his arms out of the way when it's right to him. And if I have a guy with 90 control how is he so sloppy with the ball. Don't forget the new no touch dribbling works 1 out 100 times if you're lucky. Also their CPUs pick up on patterns but yours will just jog around having a great time doing nothing. If it's the final 10 mins in a game and you're down 1-0 you're telling me if I have 4 guys around the guy with a ball they wouldn't be all out pressuring him. And if you lose the ball or take a bad touch your guy is frozen or stumbles. In real life you can move after a bad touch. There is so much wrong with the game.
If you're going to make a game where you beat Chelsea 5-0 and lose to Aston Villa 2-0 how is that possible. The game is so inconsistent and it's unrealistic. Why are the formations you can choose so weird too. I don't want all my players 30 yards away from each other. And there is no movement from your CPUs. Their team picks up on patterns and if I have Bale just because he's dribbling that doesn't mean Fazio is faster than him who has a speed rating in the 30's. It's a joke. How come their goalie can save an upper 90 shot and mine can't even jump up and grab a ball that was cleared into the air. Also if I have Marcos Rojo and they have Benteke and there is a cross how is Benteke just 1 foot over him pushing him out of the way getting in front and power heading it right to De Gea who of course missed it because the game is fixed. The game completely messes with your team. It's like if you're gonna be bad at least be consistent.
I see so much movement one game and none the next. And you're telling me that Rojo can't go up for a header or get in the way so it's not a goal and force him into a bad header. Also refs suck. If I'm getting my jersey pulled and hacked and unfair tackles and I slide and get the ball how is mine a foul and theirs isn't. Plus you're saying Neymar can't outrun a slow outside back and what's funny is that they know what you're gonna do. They basically know I'm gonna cut inside and then of course it's an automatic goal on a counter attack cross. I want it to seem like I'm playing a real person not a computer. If I have Neymar Depay and Rooney up top how come neither one of them can dribble score or cross it. It's an absolute joke. EA is a joke. I hate to say it but I might switch to PES because I want to play the same that I love and I want a good game.
Stop saying you have all new mechanics and a brand new updated changed game. It's the same game with new updates to ratings. Messi is not a 96. He cuts, he's fast and he shoots. Nothing more. Plus skill moves like rolling the ball and stuff like that shouldn't take me to switch my hand position just so I can't hold L2 and use the right stick when it doesn't even do the right move that I want it to do. It's a joke and I'm done. EA I'm done. Also 2k16 sucks. If a guy blocks me do you see people in real life freeze dribble the ball 5 times and then get back up? No you don't because that doesn't happen. Be realistic and consistent or stop making shot games. It's a joke and so is your company. NHL they pass behind the goal and pass to the front and goal all because my CPUs can't adjust and do something useful.
You suck EA. You can kiss my ass. Make your game realistic and consistent. Even if it's consistently bad at least I know what I'm buying. If you make a game where Ronaldo can make a pass then but can't do it later when it's a short drop pass then goodbye. You make my team so good in one game and thenÂ… suck in the next because you control the CPUs in the background. Also if a ball is in the air why is the guy farthest away running in to go get the header. There's aÂ… guy right below. Just let him go up and get it. It's a complete joke and I'm done with yourÂ… EA. I'm done and so are others.",3554,615,616,2,I've been playing Madden games for many years now.

It seems to me if you don't have a YouTube page with over 2K likes you don't get nothing. I watch people YouTube videos and they pull 90s players out of every pack. This game is totally unfair... That's why this will be the last EA game that I own. I'm not the only one that feels this way either. All my other friends feel the same!!!,3555,616,617,1,"Never buy a EA product. A once great dynasty and franchise has whittled down to nothing. They care not for their customers or the product they are selling. If you want a great EA game purchase Madden 2005. That's the last time they truly cared about their products. Ultimately buying a modern version of the game would be a subpar polished version of 2005 game without them forcing you to purchase extra to have a somewhat decent gaming experience. They are truly the worst company in America. That is not a exaggeration. The management does not care about the customer. If you have a problem with the company, they will not help you. Don't waste your time calling them. Just report them to a consumer report.",3556,617,618,1,"This is why monopolies are BAD FOR THE CONSUMER. Since EA has bought the exclusive rights to the NFL/NHL, these games have been subpar at best and downright BETA at worst. It's clear that they do NOT spend much money on programming and instead sink money into marketing and promotion. Their customer support is condescending. Game play is usually clunky. They never add more than one feature to any game per year.
I did not buy Madden 16 (it was given to me) and I would like to give it back. Overly complicated game play made so to distract you from obvious game script errors and subpar AI on the human team. Same with NHL. The game often plays like old 80's electronic football except with hockey players. Many times, it's as if your teammates don't even know what sport they play. Other times you can't select the player that is closest to the play. Still more times it feels like passing is using a 4 direction D-pad. They don't care, they don't even try, and it's criminal how much money they steal every year. I honestly wish there were a way to sue them for this.",3557,619,620,2,"Without any confirmation via email or phone, an unknown person was able to access and change the email corresponding to my account.

Our shipping company we use has been behind."" Funny they take their money out soon as you hit purchase and tell you 7-14 days shipping but couple days shy of 30 days now and biggest thing is my son won't get his Christmas gift!

I corrected it and placed my order the second time, thinking that was the problem. Well, lo and behold, I got the same error message.
I contacted their online support because the failed charges showed up on my card. Online support said that whether or not my order goes through, there will still be authorization charges and that it will fall off the account in 3-5 business days. That does not make sense! If there is a problem placing any order on any other website, the company will not put through authorization charges at all.

This year, we decided to order the cards online to try and avoid the in store issues we had last year. No better service. The cards were ordered online and the initial order was declined. We found that Academy has limit to the amount of cards you are able to purchase. Nowhere on the website does it say there is a limit - issue #1. Next, we could not re-order the cards until 24-48 hours had passed. I had to contact customer service to order the cards, which meant sitting on hold for over 45 minutes - issue #2. Once cards were ordered, we had to wait 3-5 days before arrival. Cards arrived, required to call back in to customer service and give an activation code that was sent to me via email - issue #3. After sitting on hold for 37 minutes, an employee answered the phone but was not able to assist me because ""she was new and had only been working there for 2 weeks"". She kept me on hold for another 22 minutes only to tell me someone would have to call me back - issue #4. She stated she was sending an email to the person who would be activating the cards and I would get a call ""as soon as she received the email"".

First it takes them 4 days just to pack and purchase shipping label for the order. Then FedEx (the best shipping company) does their part like they always do 3 days it arrives (12/2/17). But all isn't lost. I can still go Sunday morning early before football right!!? Wrong. I open the box pull the pair for me out to check the fit. They're not in the plastic bag and all tags were ripped off. I pull them out, start to put them on and realize they're covered in dried mud and have a finger sized hole right above the boot (Kinda defeats the purpose of waders if they're going to fill up with water while your wading).
So then I open the pair I got for my dad. And they too are covered in dried mud with no tags or packaging. So my next thought was I can't believe they just took returned ones and threw them in a box and shipped them to me. But then I'm think why would their distribution warehouse have returns? I look at shipping label and Oh they shipped my order from a Store (#0247 1650 N Hwy 77 Waxahachie TX 75165) not the warehouse. Seem any respectable company would check all returns to see if they've been damaged or show wear before putting them back out for sale and then sell them instore at a discount properly marked.

So I give it to him, because I donÂ’t have anything to hide, like I said I just bought three here over the summer, and they didnÂ’t ask to run my license just to check it out.
He gets on a computer, starts doing something with my license, then 5 minutes later, he tells me that I'm on a do not sell list, so I canÂ’t even look at it, like I said I just bought 3, 1000 rifles, and I've never been in trouble my whole life.

Thanks for a lot of stress and frustration!",3567,630,631,1,"This was not a great week for us at BSC, Lexington. We've been longtime loyal members supporting the club through regular attendance at the gym and the classes, my daughter over 10 years and me around 5 years. We've made many wonderful friends but this week something happened that changed our outlook of the club. You see my daughter suffers from anxiety and depression so using the gym is a fundamental part of her overall mental health. For 10 years she used the gym undisturbed and just going about her business, but the staff had no idea about her disability.
Anyway, one evening this week I received a call from her cell phone. She was clearly distressed and screaming, ""Dad a man is disrespecting me in the gym."" Without hesitation I jumped into my car and sped quickly to see what was going on. Upon arrival at BSC, Lexington I found her near the entrance sobbing her heart out. There were no staff consoling her. Just the general public. She had just finished using an elliptical machine and in her haste forgot to clean it down as we sometimes do. An older man who had been using another elliptical machine, left his machine, waited for her to finish up in the ladyÂ’s room, then chased and stalked her up the stairs and confronted in a loud voice at the front desk, yelling, ""You did not clean your machine down.""
In the meantime, the staff heard the exchange and did nothing about it. Clearly my daughter's anxiety flew into overdrive and all she could see and hear is this huge older man pursuing her. So when I arrived she escorted me in her distressed state to the older man who was still working out on the machine. As a father of a disabled child I was firstly surprised at the lack of attention from the floor staff who clearly must have seen what was happening. So I did what any dad would do. I confronted the creep, grabbed him by the shirt collar and I warned that if he ever treated my daughter like that again he would feel my wrath. Clearly, he was shaken by this time as all bullies are.
This finally got the attention of staff who escorted my daughter and I out of the gym to one of the offices. In the meantime we were told the man would be escorted out and barred from the gym. We called the police as well who were helpful given the situation and escorted the man out of the gym. Bottomline: The gym manager called me the next day to say my membership would be revoked for threatening physical violence but that the offender would continue his membership. My daughter and I argued that the man could have brought the matter to the attention of the staff instead of stalking and yelling at her all the way to front desk.
There are multiple machines scattered around the gym so this could have been avoided. In my opinion, this clearly indicates weaknesses in the BSC Lexington club procedures. It is not entirely safe or sympathetic or mindful of the safety of young girls and women since they should have at a minimum recognized what was happening and acted swiftly. Instead the offender creep was allowed to continue working out undisturbed until I decided to act. In the meantime I've lost my membership and my daughter canceled hers citing lack of safety for people like her. Shame on you BSC, Lexington. This should never happen to anyone again.",3568,631,632,1,"If you have to save your money and time, steer clear of this business. We went to inquire and were lured to use their $1 each for 2 months no contract scheme to try their business and if we liked it, we were going to be enrolled. Until today I have not expressed my like in any form or factor, however noticed that my card on file was charged an annual fee the end of the first month. There was no communication prior and I just discovered I was charged while checking my expenses. When I called the desk at Westborough to understand how this could have happened, the tone in which I was handled switched from the sweet talks that were used to sell to, there is no way out, no way you will be refunded even if you chose to give up on the trial period and did not want to use the premise.
All this when I have no binding with Boston Sports Club. The manager Tom said and I quote ""yes ma'am, you can write scores of reviews on Yelp or anywhere you choose and we are used to that. You are not getting your money back"". Looks like they have chosen to make money by pilfering from people instead of providing service as that is something they are not capable of. Steer clear of this business as they definitely waste your time.",3569,632,633,2,"HORRIBLE!!! Unscrupulous customer service and business practices!! I called the last week of February to freeze my membership. I spoke to Howard, after I gave him my name and he looked me up, he recognized me right away.

I called BSC Lynnfield, and as soon as someone answered I asked to speak to a manager. She would NOT hand me over to a manager until I explained exactly why I wanted to speak to a manager. I went through my entire story, she looked me up in the computer (after I spelled out my last name and she repeated it back to me), and told me I was not in their system. After a few more tries she located my account and told me there was no note in my account about requesting a freeze on my membership. I became quite frustrated, and I waited on the phone while she explained my situation to a manager. The manager got on the phone and asked me what was going on. He acted as if he had ZERO knowledge as to why I was calling. I heard the employee tell him exactly why I was calling. So, again I go through why I am calling. He completely disregarded me, and absolutely refused to believe that I did in fact have a phone conversation with Howard in February. This is just inexcusable!!! He was rude and disrespectful. He told me there was nothing he could do, except offer me a credit for a month after my freeze was over. A future credit absolutely does not excuse the carelessness and attitude I received. I was told the only way to cancel my membership was in person. I went in this morning to cancel, and the girl behind the desk hit a few buttons on the computer and told me I was all set. I said, ""That's it, I don't need to sign anything."" She told me, ""No."" That was a complete waste of my time!!! Of course this could have been done over the phone.

Repeated calls and emails to managers go unreturned. You are told ""the contract is online"" without any verification, and certainly nothing in writing.
When I upgraded my membership to join the Wellesley club, I was told, twice, that there would be no charge except for the monthly fee increase. I laughed: why would they expect me to pay extra in order to have the privilege of paying more each month? I laughed until I got my credit card statement with a $69.99 charge.

Such a waste of money for ""extra amenities"" that are never available for use. The hot tub is also almost always out of service so that's another wasted amenity charge. There is always confusion with credit card charges, freezing, canceling, adding or editing the account. They are only concerned with getting money and not being ripped off.

Can't wait for latitude sports clubs to gain more popularity in the area, Boston sports club sucks.",3574,640,641,2,"To be sure, the main reason I started BSC years ago was its proximity to work, that and the fact that I can use NYSC when I am in New Jersey are the only reasons I still have a membership. Among other things they recently dropped the guest feature of my membership which I would use a few times a month when my partner visited me. We argued at the front desk but were just told there was nothing they could do because it was a rule sent down by ""corporate"". Likewise, my partner was using NYSC and had been using a trainer there for months - he learned that the trainer was receiving only 30% of what he paid, so he canceled and now sees the same guy at a different gym, saving a lot of money overall.
BSC Lexington was where I started. It was small to begin with, but when they insisted on inserting their green carpeted cross-fit area, the place became a nightmare - you couldn't even move between equipment. In the summers they have a ""summer camp"" for kids, which absorbs a portion of the already limited parking with an activity area and tent, and they open their outdoor pool to the public, so they are making more money, and mini-vans typically take up every available space at the time I'm getting out of work - and I'm the one with a membership, but of course they don't care if I can't park.
BSC Waltham has only slightly more equipment but the layout is much larger so it's easier to maneuver. Even with the large staff, they're typically just sitting around, meanwhile the locker room has a pile of used towels so high that you're in danger of an avalanche. I was a member at Work Out World for over two years. The location I went to had a LOT of equipment, some older but always well-maintained, locker rooms were gross but not unlike any other gym, and you didn't get a free towel service. But for only $10 per month and a $45-year fee, I could afford to buy a new towel each time I went. I had heard some horror stories about ending the WOW membership as well, but I simply did what they asked and wrote a letter to the company requesting cancellation and it was done - no problems. I'm astonished at the number of complaints about billing issues that some agency hasn't stepped in to do something.",3575,642,643,2,"I called today to cancel my gym membership with Boston Sports Club of Lynnfield MA, I believe I spoke with Dianna.

After I told my reason she stated that I cannot cancel because I am on a 1 year contract, I then stated I never agreed to sign anything and was never told I was on a 1 year contract, I was told it was $40 month to month only. She then states if I am moving out of state I would need to show proof of new out of state address... Well that made me very unhappy because that could take weeks. Which means they will continue to take my hard earned money out of my bank account which is not fair. If anyone can help please let me know, I was thinking of calling the attorney general's office.",3576,643,644,1,"On April 15, 2015, I saw club manager Bill ** in his office for the purpose of ending my BSC Lexington membership. He reminded me the club has a 30-day cancellation policy and my membership would be billed through May 31, 2015. I said fine, and left the office believing my membership had been cancelled. I got billed for May and paid it. I got billed for June and paid it by mistake. I got billed for July and called MasterCard to contest charges.
I have since called the club three times and have been back there in person three times. In the visits both Ashley and Bill have told me I should not have been charged for June and July, but that since I had disputed the charges they could do nothing to reverse the charges, and that it was now between the credit card company and their corporate headquarters.

Well she miss another 3 session and then was sick before she could train on the 3 that expired making my total now five. She now miss another 4 due to a Dr appointment being sick, holidays- her boyfriend coming into town etc. It become an excuse after another. So we were up to 8 session. She thought it was six but it was 8. When I showed her the proof it was 8 she started to become very angry at me, so much so that I asked her to stop as we had already wasted 15 mins of my 1 hour session.
I said ""never mind, I just let management deal with it."" At this point she screams at me, ""I train you 8 but get a new trainer."" Then she said ""I give you 10 if you do not go online."" At this point it already gone from bad to worst. I walk out to that. She said ""I have to give these to you as no one else can get paid on it."" I said ""I want nothing to do with you."" She said, ""Fine, don't come to my classes and also you think about leaving the club as they never get rid of me,"" and run and get my bag. On the way out she responds ""Oh look at the little piggy. Going to eat her feeling in red velvet cupcakes ok ok ok. You will come crawling back to me as a big old fatty."" At this point I run to management and tell her the story. All I did was question her on what I had it was 8 and she did not want to give them to me. In the 3 years I know her I never cheated her once. what makes her think I do it now After all I loved her I followed her everywhere.
I made it very clear to BSC that I will not be treated like this and asked for a refund for the 8 I was owed and the one I did not use.

I explained the situation with my charge and asked to deal with problem and change the credit card on file for my monthly fee there and then. I was told that I could not do this at the gym but had to call the membership department at headquarters. I called that afternoon and they were closed. It was a Saturday, so I understood. However, I called twice more during regular business hours the following week and several more times the next. Not once did I get a human being on the telephone.
Finally, someone called me three weeks after my first call. I provided my new card information. I received at least five more calls asking for the card information over the next few weeks. All the while I could not use the gym. Finally, after two months, BSC finally accepted the information - the same provided two months earlier. When I told them that they owed me two months back membership, they offered me $20 ""for the inconvenience."" I told them anything less than two months was unacceptable. They have refused to answer my emails. I will not call, as I now want all communications in writing.",3581,648,649,1,"BSC Lynnfield, MA training scam - I am writing to warn other gym members not to make the same mistake I did. I met with a personal trainer and was under the impression that I was signing a contract for 4 sessions at a total cost of $380. Not cheap by any means, but I really wanted to get started on a new program. My card was charged $380 and I thought I was all set. The next month my card was charged $380 again. I called the gym and they claim that I agreed to 12 sessions!! They say I signed a contract for this. I did ""electronically"" sign a document but I was under the impression that it was for 4 sessions, not 12!
When I reviewed the contract the only number on it is $380, but it also states that itÂ’s for a minimum of three months. I misunderstood, and they refuse to take off the extra charge and will charge me a third time if I don't get a note from a doctor stating that I can't train. Now I've got 8 sessions that I don't even want to go to because I'm so upset. They also claim that if the sessions aren't used weekly, they expire! I had to go out of town because of an illness in my family. So now I've lost those sessions. I don't ever want to set foot in this place again. PLEASE be sure to read EVERYTHING and don't sign any electronic documents. Has anyone else had a similar experience?",3582,650,651,2,"I signed a one year contract in March of 2014. The contract does state that there will be a $39.99 rate lock protection fee charged in January. OK, makes sense. However, I told them in January that I would be cancelling my membership on the day my contract expires, since my office location has moved and going to the club is now inconvenient. I then requested a refund of the rate lock fee. I explained that since the entire time I had a membership, I was under contract, and therefore protected against a rate increase. And, since I am cancelling my membership at the end of that contract, then the Rate Lock fee is not protecting me from anything. They said that while that makes sense, they simply will not refund the fee. Businesses need to learn that not all situations are the same and they can't simply have a one-size-fits-all policy.",3583,651,652,2,"When BSC changed to the 19.95/29.95 per month membership; the clientele became more like Work Out World and Planet Fitness. The gym was busier than ever and it was also dirtier than ever. I'm talking dirty towels and cups everywhere! Sweat stains on the mats, dirt on the mats, dust bunnies throughout the gym. A musty moldy smell lurked in areas where ventilation was poor. Two years ago this gym was a terrific place to work out, now it's a place to suck in mold and dirty air into your lungs.
Fed up with the lack of cleanliness in the gym, I decided it was time to take a break from BSC and join another gym. It took two weeks to get someone at my gym to answer questions regarding my membership. The GM in Newton actually fought with me on the phone, insults included. The conversation was so bizarre, I actually called TSI to confirm he was in fact the new GM. I looped the district manager in on the rude and uncomfortable conversation and he didn't provide any feedback. It's clear he doesn't care, but hey; at least he's following a trend. To be clear, I don't expect anything for free. I do expect to get what I pay for.
After a 30-min hold time with TSI, I was finally able to freeze my account. Fast forward to the first month where my monthly maintenance fees were supposed to be deducted; TSI debited two separate transactions of $15.00 a piece. They decided to take money out for a personal training membership I had cancelled months ago. It's been almost 30 days and I have yet to receive my refund. I reported the transactions as fraud to my bank and they turned off my card. I got this idea from the GM in Newton who told me if I wanted to avoid the 30 day cancellation period to just stop all payments from BSC and TSI. He told me ""nothing would happen to me, I would receive a few phone calls but eventually they would stop.""
If the GM at BSC is teaching me how to avoid the nonsense at TSI, what does that say about the company? Since calling TSI requires too much time on hold, I've resorted to emailing them and waiting several days for a response. At least I have a paper trail this way. Yes, TSI is the biggest gym owner/operator in the northeast, but their customer service reminds me of what it was like to call third world countries when I needed computer tech support in the early PC days.",3584,652,653,2,"I paid $150 for two membership initiation fees, one for my son and one for myself to the Waltham club. Two months later, I called to cancel my son's membership, simply because he never really used it and I don't want to waste money to pay the monthly membership fees. Here I am not trying to get refund of initiation fee or anything, just want to stop paying for future monthly memberships. Interestingly, I was told I had to go and do it in person. So I went (before the start of September), and at the desk first I was told there was no manager.
When I argued, a manager came up and looked into computer for a second. Next he told me he needed general manager to cancel it. I left my phone number and expected a call back, but the call never came. I called a few days later after the September fee was already charged; again I was told I need to go in person. I argued in the phone (in a style beyond what I normally would do), and another manager told me they would call me back in the next couple of days, but I need to expect $150 for the cancellation fee.
I have never encountered a place like this that so shamelessly abuses their customers. Most of the time when we buy something, we can return for a refund. I am not getting any service here, but they will continue to charge my credit card, as long as they can, best forever for them.",3585,653,654,1,"I was actually abused by an instructor in a group class, and we had a pretty bad confrontation. I said I would take the matter up with management, and her response was ""Go ahead!"" Now, I understand her impunity because I called management and could not get a timely response.

Since May, or longer, I forget, I have been getting multiple calls daily by a credit collections agency on behalf of NYSC. This is impossible that I owe them money as I was never a member and, more importantly, because I simply do not owe them money! This is a form of harassment and this gym is run by crooks, and considering how many other people have shared similar (and even worse) experiences, I don't think they should be in business anymore!
They are outsourcing other companies to harass ex-members and non-members in an attempt to collect unauthorized, perhaps even fraudulent funds. It is so frustrating getting 2-6 spam calls a day, during business meetings, while I'm sleeping, etc. No wonder people hate this gym! It has a horrible reputation and for good reason. Don't join, don't even do a trial Â— you'll regret it. There are so many better options out there.",3587,655,656,1,"NYSC Cobble Hill Brooklyn criminal business practices. I joined the gym with my boyfriend while living in Brooklyn. A high pressure personal trainer approached me and sold me for a personal training session while I was on the treadmill - and I agreed to buy a few sessions with her. She had me digitally sign what I was told was a liability waiver. I had no idea I was signing something that said I had to cancel in writing and/or that I was agreeing to anything more than a few sessions. She never let me see what I was agreeing to and assured me it was only to protect her if I got hurt. I canceled my membership with the gym and text the trainer that I was moving out of the area and wasn't going to do any more sessions. We canceled our membership in person in April. The gym has charged me for membership ever since and the trainer charged me 3 months of training sessions that I never agreed to at a gym I was no longer a member of. Almost $1000 total of charges that were not authorized. I disputed with Amex. The gym sent Amex an agreement I ""signed"" (must have been forged I never signed an agreement) that indicated I had to provide 30 days notice to cease training (I thought I just bought a few sessions!) Since I canceled in person - and they acknowledged said cancellation they used a different tactic to rob me - they played the ""oh you had to cancel in writing"" trick. The oldest criminal tactic used by gyms to steal from clients in the books. Anyone on this forum who would like to start a class action I would love to hear from you. These practices should be examined by the state attorney general's office. There are levels of fraud, forgery and deceptive business practices going on here that should be examined at a much higher level. One only needs to review yelp, the NYSC corporate complaint website, BBB, etc to see the number of victims of this company are prodigious. Some consumer advocacy around this needs to happen ASAP. NYSC is a vile, shady and conscienceless abhorrent company stealing money from the folks who can afford the least.",3588,656,657,2,"On 5/09/2018, fitness training consultant Antony ** signed me up for personal training sessions at NYSC. He had me sign a keypad after explaining that the sessions would be $320/month. I had no idea my digital signature from that keypad was going to be placed onto an alleged contract that was never shown to me that day. The next month, I noticed that NYSC overcharged my account. It was for $435 instead of the $320/month that I was told. When I inquired with the personal training manager about the rate increase he was dismissive and said there was nothing he could do about the overcharge, and that I would have to contact their corporate offices.
I then called the NYSC corporate offices and they acknowledged that I was overcharged, but the representative at that number didnÂ’t know why, and directed me to speak to Julie **, the general manager at the local gym. Right after I told Ms. about the mysterious rate increase, I was suddenly disconnected. I tried calling back, could not reach her, and she never returned my calls after that.
It seemed like I was getting a classic ""runaround"" scam. But I did contact the fitness manager once again; this time to cancel my personal training sessions entirely since no one could explain the overcharge. Mr. said he would not cancel the personal training sessions because I had allegedly signed a 90-day contract. As explained above, I never saw that contract; I only signed a keypad with no terms or contract in front of me. To my knowledge I had been simply signing up for $320/month sessions. I only became aware of the existence of the alleged contract after my attempt to cancel, when he sent it to me.
To my surprise my signature had been grafted/forged onto the contract without my knowledge using the imprint from the keypad I had signed. I was shocked that my signature was pasted all over a contract I never saw before this. At this point, it was clear he had neglected to make me aware of the alleged agreement during our initial meeting in May 2018, nor was I given a copy of the alleged agreement at that time. He was claiming I signed something that was never put in front of me when he handed me that digital keypad. So a digital image of my signature had been copy-pasted on three separate lines of an alleged agreement without my permission or knowledge on 5/09/2018.
Disgusted and frustrated by the deception, on June 14th, I told him over the phone that I would like to cancel the personal training agreement ENTIRELY and that I wanted to cancel not only the training sessions but my entire NYSC gym membership as well, due to their dishonest and deceptive tactics. He said I'd have to go to the gym in person to cancel. So that's what I did. The next day, on June 15, 2018, I went into the NYSC to make a complaint and cancel in person my membership. After canceling, I was given a receipt, which stated I had a $0 balance. I did not go back to the gym or have any additional personal training sessions after that.
Despite my efforts, during the first week of July I noticed that funds were still being taken from my account by NYSC. I was charged another $93.55 on 7/3/2018, $435 on 7/5/18, $105 on 7/9/18 and $165 on 7/15/18. Apparently NYSC was not abiding by my cancellation of personal training sessions or general gym membership. I emphatically deny any validity of their claims to contractual commitments because my signature was digitally forged onto an alleged agreement I did not see at the time. This has been a nightmarish experience and one which has put me into financial distress. I have researched online to see if other people have had similar experiences with NYSC and their digital keypad-enabled forgery, and there are numerous complaints. I request my funds be returned to my account as soon as possible.

I want my money back!",3590,658,659,1,"I went in to the gym at 41st & 3rd to cancel my membership in August of 2017. Believing all was canceled correctly, I didn't notice until May that they were still charging me monthly. While this is embarrassing on my end, it doesn't give them the right to take my money, as I correctly went in to cancel, and never visited the gym after. I was told they could see that I'd never been in after the date I stated, and that they believed my ""story"" (offensive use of wording, as it's not a story, but a factual occurrence) but it wasn't good enough.
I called the gym and was apologized to and told my membership was canceled at the moment, but that corporate dealt in refunds. I then called corporate and was told not only was my membership not canceled EITHER in August 2017 or May 2018 when I alerted them to the situation, but that each individual club does refunds. After a long while, I finally got a hold of someone at that gym who was willing to help me. Unfortunately, someone at their club didn't do their job properly, and I was never given any proper paperwork about the cancellation, even after I asked if I needed any.
I asked them to check the security footage to see me come in and cancel, but they said that wasn't good enough for validation, as there is no audio; something that is out of my control. So I asked to speak to the person I spoke with the day of cancellation, but was told he no longer works for them. Something else out of my control. I was told I couldn't get a refund without validation, but when I asked for the forms of validation they could give me, they refused.
The manager finally turned the case over to the ""higher-ups"" and nearly three weeks went by before I heard from them again; meanwhile I was calling and calling, being told the person was ""in a meeting,"" or ""not in yet."" I never heard back. I finally got ahold of them again when I found a new corporate contact, and they wanted to hear about the situation. I explained it, and they had the original manager from the club whom I had been dealing with finally call me back. He apologized for not responding, saying he thought the higher management was taking care of it. I said that didn't explain why he didn't return any of my calls. Eventually he said that they couldn't give me the full amount back, but would give me from the beginning of this year through May back in the monthly payments they'd taken from me. To me, this is still unfair, but I agreed, as frankly, I was tired of dealing with this.
He told me to reach out to Ian in corporate about scheduling my refund, but when Ian called me (after ignoring my first email) I was promptly informed I'd not be getting ANY money back. Even after I explained the situation, being thrown around, and not responded to. He offered me a discounted membership though. What an insult! That is the last thing I'd want; belonging to a gym who treats its members so terribly.
I am beyond frustrated and disappointed. In total, they took over $1,000 from me. When I called originally, I was jerked around about who could properly handle my situation, and was lied to twice about being cancelled. When I asked them to check my records of validation, they said it wasn't good enough. When I explained how I followed all proper procedures, but someone from their end didn't do their job correctly, I was told they ""felt badly"" for me. When I was told I'd get some semblance of a refund, and when I asked for it in writing, I was told this would not happen. AVOID THIS TERRIBLE GYM AT ALL COSTS. They'll take your money, no matter how correctly you follow their cancellation procedures. I am so upset.

I gave them a new card which they successfully charged for the past due amount, a few days later the amount for November posted and later December was paid as agreed.
Then they kept charging me month after month afterwards. Once I became aware of this I called the gym multiple times, each time they assured me a manager would return my call and they didn't do that.

Instead of the management giving me a call to suggest that my monthly payment didn't go through (common practice in most businesses), they slapped me with a late fee.
I tried calling my home gym for 3 days straight, no one seems to like answering their phones there. I then went into the gym, where the manager mentioned that they have 1000s of members and it is not possible to contact every one of them. I was like that doesn't make sense because all of their members do not undergo a similar situation that I went through. After a lot of back and forth, he agreed to waive off the late fee.

Ryan keeps insisting that we should discuss this over the phone and has not provided me with the contact information to discuss with someone else. According to Paul I should be getting a refund shortly - I am waiting for this, but he was unable to provide a reason as to why I was charged even though I never completed the application process.

ItÂ’s like doing hot sweaty yoga. I have mentioned it to the staff members a few times, however, nothing was done.
Lastly, there are no attendants to replace weights or to ensure that the weights are returned back to their appropriate places.

I then went in to speak with someone, and the girl there told me that she overheard the original conversation I had with the employee to cancel my account, and she remembers him telling me there will be no yearly fee and that it is only an additional $15 to cancel.

They don't supply towels anymore (something they did when I signed up), they don't allow a guest anymore (something they did when I signed up), they don't fix broken machines, they have just one squat rack for the entire gym, plus many more issues. This gym has done nothing but charge more and more money and take away every feature that caused me to sign up in the first place. PLEASE SIGN UP FOR A GYM ELSEWHERE!",3603,671,672,2,"I have had a membership with NYSC for a number of years and multiple times. Each time I cancelled my membership was due to rates going up over and over again without notice. The last time I signed up it was during a promotional season where it was stated that If I pay an annual fee that it would lock in my current rate or I can opt to not pay the annual fee and risk having my rate go up. So from prior experience I opted to pay the annual fee. Lo and behold 1 year later I get a notice that my rate will be going up. I contacted the manager and he said that there was nothing he could do since it came from Corporate. I emailed TSI and was given the runaround. They told me to contact the General Manager but he never responded. Even though I was paying the annual fee that ""locked in"" my rate they decided to raise it anyway. It wasn't in the contract that they could do such a thing but it also doesn't say they can't so Corporate took that chance. The membership supervisor in good faith said that he was sorry that even though they were told one thing that essentially they had to lie to all the members who signed up for that exact reason. He gave me a free month of membership for that reason. Unfortunately due to such scams and frustration by Corporate that employee decided to leave and now that Club's business is getting worse. Now I noticed that my rate jumped by 50% without any notice. I already contacted the Club and you guessed it, I'm getting the runaround. I'm bracing myself for the ensuing back and forth and the same experience everybody else has been getting about membership dues increase, balance due, cancellation issues, recurring fees despite the fact that the membership has been cancelled, and fees going to collections. Perhaps the only way to put a business with such unethical practice is by going to the Attorney General.",3604,672,673,1,"I signed up with New Rochelle NYSC a few years ago. Originally I had the promotional offer of either $20 or $29 per month. I decided to go for the higher membership only because that allowed me to bring a guest, my brother. A month after sign up they advised me that that membership would no longer include a free guest. Since that was the sole reason I signed up for the higher membership I cordially and calmly asked about downgrading. I was told no. This of course seemed like a bait and switch scam. Since then IÂ’ve had my monthly membership go up without warning, IÂ’ve had to call numerous times to inquire about charges that I was not advised of and most recently I was a $49.95 rate lock in fee. A few which IÂ’ve never seen before and which I never received a single email, letter or text about.
NYSC is the king of mystery charges. The last time I had to resolve an issue the rep took weeks to get back to me and then another few weeks to institute what he had promised. When I called to inquire about it I was told that I shouldÂ’ve received an notice about the charge beforehand. When I said I hadnÂ’t received a letter I was told, Â“Oh we do emailÂ” to which I again stated I had not received a single email from NYSC. The rep also couldnÂ’t explain at first what the charge even was, he didnÂ’t know. IÂ’m totally fed up with NYSC.
I was initially excited to join NYSC but I would advise everyone to avoid it at all costs. The number of complaints and the reputation theyÂ’re developing is a sure fire way to eventual disaster. Good customer service is everything and NYSC doesnÂ’t do good customer service. Besides the various mysterious and unexplained charges their facilities are not impressive for all the hassle and most of the good classes require an extra fee. YouÂ’re basically just paying for a pool if youÂ’re lucky. This is all sad to say because when I first signed up I was very excited but after countless bait and switch experiences, unannounced increased fees and just horrible customer service IÂ’m done. I warn anyone thinking of joining to please donÂ’t!

I have a monthly plan that allows me to visit all NYSC clubs. When I looked at my statement I saw a $20 charge. After calling the club, they explained the club on 23rd is an elite club and they would charge me $20 every time I visited that club. There was no notification of kind by email or the front desk staff that I would be charged. When I asked them what was ""elite"" about this club, they literally said they didn't know. They also mentioned that they would refund the fee because they have been receiving many calls for the same reason as mine.
Hearing this, from a customer point of view, it feels like NYSC is taking money from their customers without them knowing. NYSC shouldn't have to wait for people to call for the refunds if they are receiving this many complaints They should refund ALL their customers that have been charged this extra fee for visiting an ""elite"" club and then work on communication strategy to notify their customers of their policy changes more clearly before implementing their new changes. I've been with NYSC for 7 years and this seems like a very shady process.",3606,675,676,2,"I signed up for NYSC Avenue A membership in June 2016 during a special. My contract indicates $39.99 will come out the first of every month, and my contract also reflected a one-time membership fee. Fast forward to July 2017. I see a $59.99 charge through my bank from NYSC. I called indicating the error, the customer service rep said per my contract, I must pay an annual $59.99. I had him refer to my contract wherein he found no such language authorizing NYSC to debit $59.99 from my account. The money was put back in my account. Fast forward to August 2017. I decided I would move my membership over to Blink since they have better reviews, and you get more for money, and my friends go there. Per my contract, after the one year which ended in June 2017, the contract defaulted to month-to-month, and cancellation per the terms must be 30 days.
On 8/25, I called the membership line and they instructed me to go to the club. I went into the NYSC club on this day on 51st & Lex, the woman working indicated only the general manager could process cancellation, she scanned my tag, and said nothing further was needed. Based on the language of the contract, I decided to do a follow-up call. An hour or so later on 8/25, I called to confirm submission of my cancellation request. The customer service rep indicated there was no evidence of me going in a club, and then she said I must do this with a general manager. I was clearly frustrated, especially because I have a planned trip, and want my cancellation in before 30 days is up to avoid getting an Oct 1 $39.99 fee.
The woman also told me I could only go into my home club which is Avenue A to cancel. I told her there was no language on the contract regarding same, and the exact sentence on their website when you sign into your account, under cancellation it states ""members may initiate the cancellation in person at any club location"", she was still arguing with me that I was going about this incorrectly without any evidence on her part. I was then told to head to Avenue A and ask for the general manager, Joelle as she is working on Saturday 8/26. I went into the club, and Joelle was not there, and I was told I was the second person that came in asking for her. The girls at the counter were unable to assist me, because, again, only the general manager can handle cancellations.
Today, August 28, I called Avenue A to see if Joelle was in, and I was now told that I must make an appointment with her to cancel my request - this was never told to me, and further, she was not available to meet today (8/28). Given that I'm leaving out of town, and I do not come back until after Labor Day, this would give Avenue A another month of my fees, and they will be charging me $39.99. After calling my bank, and giving them the rundown, I was advised to file a claim. Now my bank is handling this.
I am extremely disturbed by this cancellation policy. With that being said, it appears said policy is geared around inconvenience as a tactic to continue taking membership fees, as well as breaching their own contract by debiting $59.99 annual fee from me, which on my contract says ""Annual Fee: $ 0"". Lastly, NYSC renewed my contract with them, without consent, no evidence, no signature, no recorded conversation indicating I agreed to same and construed my conversation of asking for my $59.99 back as a renewal. I have been documenting every call and visit with NYSC and am hopeful my bank will determine their tactics as a theft threat.",3607,676,677,1,"Ordered a ping pong table for my youngest son and it isn't available to be delivered so I said pick up in store... chose a store with stock only to get an email that my order was cancelled because they don't have any. They suggested I waited until the next flash sale and I told them even when you look online no stores in my area have any tables, so it makes no difference. Why do you put big items on sale that are not available to everyone. I dislike Dick's. Overpriced and never helpful in the stores either. I hope Amazon shuts them down.",3608,678,679,1,"I was shopping at the Dick's Sporting Goods in the Dayton Mall over the weekend. It is my son's first year playing football and we went out to get all of his stuff. I purchased his cleats a football a pair of socks a cap a pair of football gloves a water bottle among other things. The next day I am getting the bags ready for my son to go to football and realize the gloves are not in there. I call the store and let them know that one of the items I purchased was not there. I was told by management that they would review the tapes and give me a call back to let me know if my statement was true. I have worked in retail management almost 20 years, I have never even thought about telling a customer that I would review the tapes because I do not believe them when they did not receive an item.
When a customer takes time out of their day to call about something that was left there, the customer should be apologized to for the mistake that the store has caused. They should apologize for the fact that that customer has to come back up to the store to receive their merchandise. There should be no mention of having to review a security tape to see if the customer is lying. I felt like they were telling me I was lying and trying to steal from this company. If this was only a five or $10 item I would just go buy another one but these were a $25 pair of football gloves. I have never had a worst customer experience in my life.
I will be sure to tell every person I encounter and everybody in the entire School District to not go to Dick's for their sporting needs. I will definitely not be returning for the next 8 years that my son is in School playing sports. This shows that this company does not value their customers or their experiences within the store. The way to build a company and create a positive Revenue over last years is by building customer relations. When you have a bad experience in a store you tell everyone, when you have a good experience in the store you might tell a few people. It looks like the majority of the stores reviews are definitely not satisfactory.",3609,679,680,2,"This is the second time I've had problems with Dick's Sporting Goods. This past order was by far the worst response from Dick's Sporting Goods. My husband ordered a Bauer Hockey Shield for my son who plays hockey, this was his gift for doing well in school. So he ordered the shield and it finally came today! Well the shield was supposed to come with a hockey helmet bag, and mounting screws for the old helmet and new shield. Guess what didn't come??? The hockey bag and the mounting equipment! I emailed customer service, and nothing in return. The customer service emailed me back their response was basically either return at the store for a full refund which was over 60.00 or send back the shield and, ""We will send out another after that has gotten back to us."" The shield was ordered online because their store didn't have it. I will never spend any more money online for Dick's or in the store.",3610,680,681,2,My most recent order online was terrible and I am done doing business with Dick's because of that experience. I used both the chat and phone number for customer service but nobody helped me. No one would answer my question or give me any solutions. When I placed my order and printed my receipt it said it would be one price but then a minute later I got an email with a completely different higher price. That is completely shady and misleading. No one answered why that happened or why my card is being charged for way more than what their website and receipt originally said. I would've canceled but no one was helpful and now I will return just on the principle of not supporting shady businesses.,3611,681,682,1,"I ordered two jerseys online and selected IN STORE pickup. However, when I arrived at the store to pick up the jerseys, the store only gave me one jersey and said the other one had been shipped to me and wouldn't arrive until 10 days out. I needed it for a sports event that night which is the reason I ordered two jerseys in the first place and selected IN STORE pickup--one for each of my sons.
Instead of cancelling the shipment of the second jersey and giving me the jersey that I'd ordered online (which they had in stock) they told me I could purchase ANOTHER jersey and then when the jersey I'd ordered came in the mail, I could come in and get a refund for it. So essentially they wanted me to pay for 3 jerseys so that I could leave the store with 2. I called customer service for their help and was told the same thing. I literally made the online order 45 minutes before arriving at the store to pick it up. There is NO WAY the other jersey had already shipped in 45 minutes. I will take my business back to Academy from now on where they actually care about their customers. I can see that your store is called DICK'S for a very good reason.",3612,682,683,1,"DICK'S business practices are seriously flawed. As a customer, I have been treated very, very poorly. Let me explain what has happened up to this point. On April 12 I placed an order for a set of golf clubs. I received a delivery date of 4/18. My wife stayed home on 4/18 to accept the delivery. The clubs did not arrive on 4/18. Over the course of 4/18 and the following two days at no time did I receive a call, email or text message from DICK'S to inform me of the status of my clubs. Concerned and pressed for time because of an upcoming golf trip I had to call your customer service department to get an order status. I was informed that the clubs were lost! And when I say lost, I mean a DICK'S customer service rep told me that they had no idea where the clubs were.
At this point the DICK'S customer service rep presented me with two options - cancel the order outright or cancel the order and place another ""2nd"" order. I asked that a 2nd order for the clubs be placed. The customer service rep then told me she was going to place a 2nd order. At which point I thought that the order was placed...however... I checked my email on 4/21 and saw that the 1st order was canceled but I saw no information that a 2nd order had been placed. This seemed suspicious, so I once again called customer service. I was informed by the representative that the 2nd order was never placed. I was a bit annoyed but since I still wanted the clubs I worked with the representative and placed the 2nd order. She discounted the clubs as compensation and I received a delivery date of 4/28. I thought everything was finally straightened out however...
4/28 came and went and no clubs. On 4/30 I checked my tracking order to check on the status of the order. I discovered the order was canceled! Confused, at 11 AM I placed another call to customer service to find out why the order was canceled. The customer service rep told me that the order was canceled due to the item being out of stock. I couldn't believe it. Infuriated and frantic because of my upcoming golf trip, I asked that I speak with a manager and I was forwarded to a call center supervisor. She told me she was sorry and I think she expected me to be satisfied with a simple ""we're sorry"".
I explained to her that as a customer I need to be compensated for my trouble by finding the exact clubs or clubs that are similar to the clubs that I purchased in one of the DICK'S stores for me to pick up (I do not trust their courier service). She then forwarded me to some DICK'S store clerk in Freehold and dropped off the call. She actually dumped me on some guy who works in the store and bailed. Incredible! This store guy was apologetic and tried to help but did not have the clubs in stock and was not authorized to make me an offer for another set...so...
This store guy told me my only recourse is to call customer service...again!!! So this time my wife called customer service. She had to once again explain the history behind this debacle to someone else. In fact, it is now 2 PM and she is still on the phone with customer service. Another thing worth mentioning, DICK'S customer service rep actually questioned if the 1st order was really lost, basically calling me a liar. So not only did DICK'S waste my time, not only did they lose an item that I had purchased and then didn't have the decency to contact me and tell me that they lost it, not only did they sell me the same item for the 2nd time and not actually have the item in stock and not have the decency to contact me to tell me, but one of their reps actually questioned my credibility? I'm stunned that a retail company would treat a customer this poorly.
So as of 2 PM, this matter has not been resolved. I am now being told by the rep that the only compensation that DICK'S will offer is points on some reward program or an offer to buy more expensive clubs. This is absolutely ridiculous. In fact, it seems that the initial discounted offer on the clubs was some sort of scam to lure me into buying more expensive clubs. However, I am completely resolved to escalate this matter as far up the chain as possible and to use social media as a way to explain to potential customers that they treat customers like garbage. They've wasted my time and aggravated me to no end.",3613,683,684,2,Ordered an incline trainer online. When it came in the electrical system was not working. Took them over three weeks to come get the equipment and it sat in my living room and pieces for over a week. Then I had to rent a truck and build a second one to replace the first one. And now itÂ’s taking over a month to get my refund back for the first one. I will never deal with them again.,3614,684,685,1,"DICKÂ’S SPORTING GOODS Â– A pitiful online order, delivery and return system. What a nightmare! I am an experienced online shopper with a Master's Degree in Business, used to efficient, effective service from many online retailers such as Amazon. So I expected more of the same Â– but not from DickÂ’s who I tried once and will not use again! Poor delivery Â– poor return system Â– poor customer service department Â– poor accounting! And I am out $18.11!
HereÂ’s What Happened: On March 16/2018, with the assistance of a salesperson from the Brownsville Texas DickÂ’s store, I placed an online order for a pair of golf shoes that they were out of stock in the store. He assured me that there would be no delivery charge, and that if they didnÂ’t fit, I could return them without shipping charges. On March 26th, the shoes arrived three days AFTER the promised delivery date. I returned the shoes the next day because they did not fit, following the instructions in the package (I was surprised because they did not provide a return UPS sticker) and was charged $18.11 at our local UPS store!
As I was due to leave Texas the next day, I did not quibble over the charge but complained. (I have the receipt for the UPS charge.) I wrote an email to Customer service complaining about the UPS charge when shipping was supposed to be free. I got NO response. I have been awaiting a credit to my ISA account since then. It is now April 16th Â– one month after this process started and I still donÂ’t have my money back for the shoes.
I called DickÂ’s customer service today. The agent I spoke with was very nice but could do nothing. She had no record of my email complaint. She didnÂ’t know why the shoes were late. She didnÂ’t know why they didnÂ’t include a UPS return label in the box. She said I could have taken the shoes back to a DickÂ’s store, but the nearest DickÂ’s store is a 50-minute drive away (until the McAllen store opens). She said that my account had been credited on April 13th but that it would take three to five business days to clear. That means it could take up to April 20th, if the system is reliable, which I now doubt. I hope that the call Â“was recordedÂ”.
So: 1. Dick's has had my money since March 26th. 2. The delivery was late. 3. It cost me an additional $18.11 and my time to return the shoes. 4. No-one at Customer Service responded to my email and they have no record of receiving it. 5. After all of this rotten experience, I am still waiting for my $151.54 credit to my VISA. I will not use DickÂ’s again. I will not recommend it to any of my friends or colleagues.",3615,685,686,0,"I'm writing to share a recent experience at the Augusta Mall location, in Augusta, Georgia; wherein, I and my companions, were verbally assaulted, by a sales associate. On Sunday, April 8, 2018, my companion, son, and his companion, arrive at Dick's Sporting Goods, Augusta Mall location. I inquired with the young lady behind the service desk/register, the location of the inversion tables. She did not necessarily answer but instead looked hesitantly at the other cashier when she bopped up, and explained that they have to use locks so we wouldn't be able to actually hang. I said, ""Thank you, I understood,"" and asked again, where they were located. She finally pointed, and, off we went to look.
We arrive at the section where three inversion table models are displayed. My group is looking them over when a male sales associate, in a light purple shirt, comes out from the back, and asks if we need any help. I looked at him, and said, ""We are definitely buying an inversion table. At the moment, we are deciding which model, so at this moment, I do not believe we need help but when we make our decision, just be around then so you can pull it, and we can get on out of here."" He nodded his head, agreed with me, laughed, and said, ""Let me know if you have any questions.""
In hindsight, this where I should have asked, ""Which models do you have in stock?"" But, I didn't because, well, gosh darn, Dick's is a pretty major retail store. I honestly didn't think that stock would be an issue. And, at this point, begs the question, why didn't the sales associate actually do his job and go check which were in stock for the customer to purchase when the customer flat out told him exactly what they were looking for upon initial contact? To continue with the story, we spend ten, fifteen minutes discussing, and we decide we wanted the more expensive Teeter model, for $399 and change. We look around to locate the sales associate, he's nowhere to be found. We search, we ask, we ask, we search. At this point, no one is helping us.
Finally, he bops back around, I smile and tell him the model we've decided upon, joking that they've selected the most expensive. He walks over to it, looks at the tag, looks back at me and says, ""Let me check to see if we have it in stock."" I looked at him, and said okay. Admittedly, a bit irritated that he didn't take the time before to look what he had in stock, if there was a possibility of a stock issue. He takes leave, we wait, and wait. The sales associate comes back, and informs us that he doesn't have two of the three models in stock. TWO of the three models NOT in stock. I then ask my one and only, very reasonable question, ""When will you have them in stock?"" His answer was, ""I don't know."" And, said it, with a very lackadaisical, mocking, laughing tone in his voice. At that point, ""I turned and said, ""Well, you're useless."" And, walked to the front of the store.
Having trained in customer service for over 30 years (Fortune 100), the one answer that is overwhelmingly unacceptable in any given sales opportunity, is the response, ""I don't know."" It is an absolutely inappropriate response. His response should have been, ""Let me check"", but it wasn't. For me, that sales associate had become useless. I was there to purchase an inversion table, and HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HELP ME, was unable OR UNWILLING to answer my ONE question.
As I was walking out, I stopped at the register of the only associate that appeared to know anything, the same one that directed us to the inversion table display area, and explained to her what had just happened. The male sales associate literally CHASES me down, and starts yelling at me! Screaming at me, shouting over me and the other female sales associate, ""I asked you if you had any questions. You should have asked me your questions when I asked you if you had any?"" SCREAMING at me, physically posturing his body, raising his hands over his head YELLING, and conducting himself in a HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE AND UNCALLED FOR MANNER, ""Have a blessed day."" No less than a dozen times. Literally, shouting me down, my companions down, over talking the poor little female sales associate.
He became UNGLUED, PHYSICALLY AND VERBALLY AGGRESSIVE with a female customer, and your other female employees. It was the worst display of misogynistic, religiosity driven behavior I've ever witnessed. So, this sales associates, instead of doing his job, treats a customer who has made it clear that they are buying, no actual sales skills needed, just the stock to actually purchase an item ends up getting chased out of the store by a screaming sales associate??? I called the store yesterday, Monday, April 9th, early morning, and did speak with a young man that identified himself as Corey. Considering how upset I was when I spoke with him, he handled himself quite well. He took my name and number, said he would conduct an investigation, get with his personnel director.
I explained to him, in no uncertain terms, that I feel that this male associate needs to be dismissed. He said he would get back to me, and believe he did, but I didn't answer. I've chosen to deal with this matter going forward, in written form. I also decided to not send this communication until today so that I could calm down, attempt to see the situation from all points of view, and I keep coming back to we were mistreated, BADLY, by your sales associate, and something needs to be done, so I will speak up, out, and against this sales associate.",3616,687,688,1,"I went in yesterday (YORK PA) and purchased a pair of tennis shoes for my son.

Tasha at customer service says again there is nothing she can do, and I will be contacted by phone or email in 3 to 5 days. Is this 2004? This should be Dick's problem, not the customer's that follow return policy. I have ordered from Dick's a few times in the past. However, they have lost me as a customer at this point.

When I received the item I opened it up to wrap it in the Christmas wrapping paper and I saw both men's long wear had PLASTIC SECURITY TAGS! I wanted to remove the tag, but it broke and inside of that tag was SHARP, LIKE RAZOR GLASSES with an unknown liquid inside, instantly I was bleeding and that liquid mixed into my blood!
I called the Company and I told them that ""WHO SENDS AT CHRISTMAS TIME CLOTHING WITH SECURITY TAGS?"", they said, ""You could it take to the store and they can take it off!"" I replied that If I had time for the stores and shopping, I wouldn't have shopped online! I asked them what kind of liquid was inside the plastic tag? I CUT my hand and the liquid burst into the blood, They said they don't know what chemicals it contains, they don't know even what liquid it is! Is anyone checking employments IQ's before hiring? Maybe they don't do that test on purpose! If they were given IQ tests they WON'T HAVE ANY EMPLOYEES, there.

I will be looking at alternatives.",3625,696,697,1,We did the free trial and cancelled the trial on the day we were suppose to. They billed us $44.99 and said we did not cancel in time.

We called as soon as we saw the charge on our credit card (we had to try 5 different times because wait times were over an hour each time... another huge red flag). They said it was over a week since purchase and we couldn't cancel. We didn't even know about the charge until we got our credit card statement. At that point it was almost a month later. Steven at customer service was awful and said no one at their facility has the ability to refund money to people. I have never written a bad review... ever.

If I'm watching a show and want to see something else, I literally have to back out 7, 8, 9 times before I can get back to My Shows. Shows that I've set up to record, don't. I could care less about the guide, it doesn't suffice for everything thatÂ’s gone wrong since the update. Oh, did I mention that the descriptions are in such a small font that you can't read anything without. I can't believe such a large corporation doesn't fix, nor care about their customers problems.

Or, won't let you watch it until it's done, which the next day, I likely hear the score before having the opportunity to watch the game, and, I wanted to watch it that night anyway! Yesterday we started watching the Super Bowl a few minutes late and paused a couple of times and the last 2 minutes of the game got cut out and it jumped to the post game interviews.

I found that this company has a lot of dissatisfied customers who have been mislead. The first red flag was when they tried to charge me for more money than what was listed on the checkout page.

The extra money may be charged by the blank as the blank fee. Hope you can understand."" NOTICE THE WRONG SPELLING OF BANK? This is a RED FLAG that this company is most likely from another country and might be a scam where you don't get what you see or ordered. If you get your order. Thank goodness for my bank! I suggest you stay far away from this place.",3633,704,705,2,"I ordered an Eagles Super Bowl Champions polo right after they won the Super Bowl. The shirt I ordered was nearly all black and stated that the graphics would be embroidered on the shirt. Since I placed the order, the image of the shirt changed to black with gray sleeves. I didn't check the description at the time but received my shirt today and found out the item description also changed from embroidered graphics to heat sealed graphics. I paid $60 for a black shirt with embroidered graphics and received a black and grey shirt with heat sealed graphics.
I have since spoken with their customer service department several times and they are beyond useless. When explaining what was going on, the customer service agent said they would normally offer a replacement but the item is currently out of stock. She didn't seem to grasp the fact that the item description completely changed since I ordered the item and therefore a replacement was pointless because I would once again receive an incorrect item. She then said she'd waive the return fee which was obvious since they screwed it up.
However, after waiting about 3 weeks on a special event item. I can no longer find the item I originally ordered since everything is out of stock everywhere. So I had to settle for an incorrect shirt with a slight discount just so I could have something from the Super Bowl win. Overall, terrible and completely useless customer service. They could not provide me a reason for the complete change of the item I ordered. I also noticed the item number listed in their order confirmation and the PayPal transaction did not match up. I will NEVER again order from them.",3634,705,706,1,"So, I ordered a custom Saints sweatshirt for my boyfriend's birthday... The patch completely peeled off the first time he wore it! So embarrassing. They had a fancy iron on made but didn't bother to iron it on. Worth a crap when they should have sewn it in the first place... considering it took extra processing days. When I contacted them about it they told me (after I read that it was non-returnable due to custom nature) that they could return it but not offer me a refund. I told her I didn't want another one sent just to have this happen again. I just wanted a refund... My boyfriend liked the design & we can get it sewn on but the point is this whole thing was unnecessary; especially for the price.
They offered me a $15 refund for a $75 item... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! That didn't even cover my original cost of shipping. When I asked her why they couldn't at least offer half of the cost of the item like most places she said she was sorry but that was the best she could do. Talk about pissed. Never again ordering from here... I hope my review helps some of you guys avoid issues!",3635,706,707,2,"I used NFL Shop for the FIRST time on Feb. 3rd (and it will be the last!).

(Normal orders show as New when you first place them, then ""Processing,"" then ""Shipped"") I have contacted Customer Service 4 times so far, 2 times via live chat, 2 times via phone and the customer service reps are clueless useless fools. Sorry to be so harsh but that's what it is.
What absolutely irks me is my card was immediately charged early morning Sun. Feb 4th - so they already have my money! The live chat I had on Tuesday morning, the responses to my questions were extremely slow, 1-2 minutes from my question to a template based answer that resolved nothing at all - and of course like any website, phone call you make, these companies want to to take a customer satisfaction survey. If I get decent customer service and a big issue is resolved, yeah I have no problem letting them know the rep was very helpful. If it's poor... sorry, not wasting my time unless they are going to give me something in return. These never improve service anyway.
My LATEST phone call about my order again, this morning. This woman, who sounded like she was eating an early lunch as she was talking softly lets me know ""your order is scheduled to ship February 7th"" - Seriously? I was floored, I immediately kind of snickered in disbelief and told her, ""ok, can you tell me what today's date is?"" There was a brief pause, then she said ""Feb 15."" Then puts me on hold to 'look into it' (yeah, sure.) Comes back and tells me it will ship today, you get an email with a tracking number (yes I know that!). Then tells me the warehouse is behind schedule. 8 days behind schedule? I realize the Super Bowl, Playoffs. Christmas are probably the most hectic times for them. But again, 8 days behind?
As for MY inconvenience I wanted free upgrade shipping since I explained - again - that they already charged my card, the info you just gave me about my item will be shipped 8 days... in the past. But no, she mumbled again, refused to upgrade. So do I think my item will ship today... no. If it does I'll be stunned. I plan to call again in a few hours to maybe get someone with a brain cell, and get a straight answer, no I won't deal with the useless ""Live Chat"" on the site again. Perhaps I'll get lucky. If this was some 10-15 dollar order, I wouldn't be AS ticked off, that doesn't matter though. This is just junk service! I just only wish this item was available in nearby stores in my area, it's not and that's why I chose this site. In fact the item I bought is sold out on every site I've checked!

I called customer support 2x the week before the game to cancel the order but was promised it would arrive before the game. They said customer service received a ""memo"" that all orders would arrive before the game as promised.

I wanted to buy some fan gear for the game, so I had decided to order from an online site. I chose NFL Shop, because of the name (had never used them before). I placed my order for a Special Event Jay Ajayi game jersey and a conference championship shirt on 26 January with expedited shipping. I received a confirmation email that stated that I would receive my items by 3 February, the day before the Super Bowl game. Well, I didn't receive my items before the game and was totally devastated since the Eagle had won the game. A few days later, I received an email stating that my shirt was shipped, but the jersey was delayed. I didn't receive my first item via expedited shipping, so I contacted customer service and they refunded my shipping fee/gave me a partial refund on my jersey and told me that I would receive my jersey 10 February.
Got an email on 6 February that my jersey is yet delayed again with no confirmation of a delivery date this time. I am totally infuriated at this point!!! I called customer service again, and I demanded to know the reason that the jersey that I had purchased has been delayed for a third time. This time I was told that my jersey would ship by 16 February. I exploded! I told the agent that I was going to order the same jersey from another service to prove that they could beat this last promised delivery date from NFL Shop (even with the expedited shipping that I had originally purchased), then I will call NFL Shop back to cancel my jersey order with a refund of my remaining balance, as well as finding an avenue to leave the worst review that I could possibly give.
I also told the customer service agent that it's apparent that NFL Shop would have as many so called issues as they are having when the Eagles win their very first and only Super Bowl, but I bet that never happens when customers/fans purchase Patriots gear. LMAO, then she gave me another partial refund on the jersey. NFL Shop is such a fake, and a joke, and I can assure everyone out there that I will never be using their lack of services again.

Of course he said he left it at the door. But the representative told me that the driverÂ’s writing wasnÂ’t very clear and he tried to write he took it to the wrong address and then back to a facility. The driver denied it however. They told me to wait 30 days while they investigate so I did. Another representative told me that FedEx has been stealing a lot of packages and that this happens often so they will change couriers. That made me feel like I had hope!!! 30 days passed and no one contacted me so I called and they tell me since 30 days passed I have to wait for an email and canÂ’t talk about this to them on the phone! So ridiculous. So now almost 3 months later I finally receive an email stating that FedEx has denied this investigation so therefore they wonÂ’t give me a refund or my merchandise. I find it so disrespectful that such a big company behaves this way. And they canÂ’t even face you. I will never order from Adidas again. They donÂ’t care about their customers. They keep thinking because theyÂ’re paying celebrities to support this brand, they donÂ’t have to treat us regular customers with respect. We choose to spend our hard earned money on Adidas for them to treat us like garbage. Now IÂ’m out of the money and the merchandise. Never again!!

Something finally arrived, and it was a completely different show -- brown and you can't even tell it's Adidas. Based on everyone else's experience, I'm not expecting satisfaction.

Opened it and only the womenÂ’s NMD was inside but the packing label said both were to be in there. I donÂ’t know how a menÂ’s size 11.5 would have fit. I called customer service on the 14th and got a nice guy who probably was new. Told him that both shoes were supposed to be delivered but the box only contained the womenÂ’s NMD. He put in a lost item claim and told me it would take 3-5 days for them to get back. Called back on the 22nd because I didnÂ’t hear anything. Spoke with another nice lady. She said that it would take 8-30 days for them to get back with an answer and that she saw a claim had been filed. Called today, March 19th, because I havenÂ’t heard anything.

Hold up so she is telling me that itÂ’s FedEx's fault that the NMDs werenÂ’t in that box and they make a decision.
FedEx in my opinion did nothing wrong. They delivered a package on time from Adidas. Whoever packed and labeled the shoes for Shipment should be the ones at fault. When you look up the label created for Shipment it even says only one item was in the box and only one tracking number was created for both the shoes.

I've ordered a few times from Adidas- in retrospect, I probably shouldn't have continued giving them business but that's another topic altogether. The first two times I tried ordering stuff from Adidas, it wouldn't process my order. I tried a few times to place it, and it kept saying it couldn't process my order. I call customer service, and after a 20-minute wait, they tell me my order couldn't be processed because my address was coming up as a Canadian address, which didn't make sense because I live in LA, and my address obviously shows as such. I've placed orders through other websites to be delivered there and have had no issues so this didn't make any sense to me. Because of the numerous attempts to place an order, Adidas blocked me from placing orders for 24 hours, and my bank blocked my card for fraud protection.
I tried to order a third time, had the same issues. I decided I'll try my work address in Irvine, and sure enough it worked. So I placed two more orders there with no issues. Fast forward to earlier this week, and I place an order for some Super CopaÂ’s. I already have my profile set up on their website, so it was fairly easy to just open up the app, place the order, and have it shipped to my default address (which is the Irvine address.) I choose the free shipping option so I should have received them on the 21 of this month. Well as it turns out, they shipped it overnight, and I got the shipping for free... except it got delivered to my parents' house, in San Diego. I have no idea how they got that address, as I've NEVER used that address for any online orders. Also, neither the package itself or the invoice contained any of my info.... literally JUST my phone number which is how my brother was able to see that it was my package.
I figure Adidas just sent my order with absolutely no shipping information to FedEx and they looked up my name and got that address (still don't know how they would have if I haven't lived there in years, but okay.) So I call Adidas. Half an hour later, I get helped by a representative who was driving me up the wall with his ""I can understand how that is frustrating, but"" generic customer service stuff. I explained to him my situation, and asked if it was possible for them to send me a label that we can print to send it my way, he says they can't. The most they can do for me is send me a return label to return to Adidas, then wait for them to confirm the return, then process the refund and credit it to my Adidas account, and I would have to order it again. I mean... seriously? You ship a package to an address two hours driving distance from me and the best you can do is that?
And the real kicker? ""Sorry there's nothing I can do for you, you can email customer relations if you'd like."" Like WAIT A MINUTE. I've been talking to customer service this entire time, and your other solution is for me to email customer relations? Aren't you both the same thing? Like you really have a customer service AND customer relations department? What? I am honestly shocked at the amount of negative reviews on here. I didn't realize their customer service was notoriously bad to this extent, and honestly wish I would have stumbled upon this website before ordering any more from them.
Adidas, your products are great, but you HAVE to improve on the customer service end. Great products isn't enough to overturn the fact that you guys consistently lack decent customer service, ESPECIALLY when you are at fault. So now I'll be sending an email to ""customer relations,"" which, if the rest of the reviews here are anything to go by, means I won't be getting a reply.",3674,747,748,2,"My daughter LOVES Adidas, I cannot tell you how much $$ we have spent on shoes and items. She received some Adidas shirts for Christmas from someone as a gift, but were too small. I finally was able to speak to someone yesterday, and I still cannot believe the conversation that took place. The girl sounded young, and like she could care less, she told me that I could not exchange the shirts for a larger size, but that I could fill out the return request and if I was approved to return the items then they would refund the amount of purchase onto a gift card, then I would have to turn around and re-purchase the same exact shirts, only now for the full price (they were purchased on sale). I explained that I was NOT going to ""return"" the shirts and pay extra for the same exact shirts, so she told me that after my order shipped I could call back again, and request a one-time 20% off which would still have me paying out of pocket for someone else's gift, for the SAME EXACT SHIRTS!!! Then one of the shirts was out of stock, but so I asked if my daughter could just pick a different shirt, and she told me no, or else I would lose the 20% offer if I decided to call back and request it. So they do not allow you to exchange items, but instead return items, then force you to buy the same exact items all over again, only for a higher price, WHAT KIND OF PRACTICE IS THIS??? When I asked the girl to explain to me Adidas' policy and the reason behind this, she replied she didn't know, she just worked there, (as it sounded like she was probably on her phone at the same time). I explained to her that we have spent a lot of money on shoes and such, but after this I would more than likely never purchase another Adidas product again, she replied ""ok"".

I had been searching for the NMD pink Adidas shoes and thought that I found them on the addidas.com website. Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong color and my daughter was not happy with the color on Christmas morning. My initial conversation with a customer service rep was on December 26th. At that time, the customer service rep told me that I was just outside the time I could return the shoes but because it was Christmas, corporate would send me an email with information on how to return the shoes. I really wanted to exchange the shoes, but I was told that I needed to return the shoes and reorder separately. I patiently waited for an email to come from corporate, but it never came. I called back on January 8th and held again for over 25 minutes for a customer service rep. This customer service representative said that for some reason my file was still pending and had not been reviewed by corporate. After holding for quite some time, I was put on the line with Brittany, a corporate supervisor. She stated that I could not return the shoes because it was past the 30-day mark. The number of days between November 15 (when I ordered not received) and December 26th is 41 days. The corporate supervisor Brittany was quite rude and unhelpful on the phone. She stated that Adidas has been really busy and thatÂ’s why corporate did not respond to my initial request with the first customer service rep made 12 days prior. The conversation was not helpful or informative. I ordered these shoes as a Christmas present and promptly tried to return them the day after Christmas which totals 41 days.

Considering I canceled the order twice a week before it sent... You think they would cancel it. I received no confirmation cancellation email, nothing. The Customer service agent obviously did not do his/her job. Obviously there's no communication within the company. This company wasted my time. Will never buy from them again.

The outcome after first class: the kid does not want to play soccer again, and he refuses the kick the ball. This was not like that before the class. The sour moment started when I was reminded. Mind you, I did read the fine print, but failed to register that the company's reference to the assessment and team placement meant that the kids started the classes and that was the assessment and placement. It is misleading and not fair. What if we do not like it? What if the coach is not good? If you like it, then you are in luck. They offered a discount for the next enrollment. Wait?! Why would I want to spend more money there, if I decided it was a mistake in the first place? Overall, disappointed with the service. The coaches are ineffective and have pretty weak rapport with kids. My son also attended a baseball course with another provider in the same time, and he had no problems obeying the coaches.

To my surprise (actually, I wasn't surprised) a ripoff report came up filed for this two-bit operation. I just thought that I would add my own report, because people really do need some buyer protection for these merchants. Occasionally, I have purchased various hockey, baseball and magic cards from this store. I have spent quite a sum of money there. One thing surprised me, the merchants never showed any manners or appreciation for my business. I spent quite a few bucks there. Now, I am an averaged size man and they didn't give me any respect, but you should see how they treat innocent children that walk into the store. I was in the store one day and there was a 6 year old boy with his older brother of about 12. Now, I'll be honest this little guy did have very curious little hand and he seemed to touch everything within his reach. The one merchant, a man with a rather large head and large stomach, wearing a maple leafÂ’s t-shirt, burst out yelling at the little boy. This happened right in front of my own eyes. The man working behind the counter yelled, and I quote Get the hell out of my store!. Both the younger boy and his older brother were startled by the man's loud tone. The older boy carried his simpering little brother out of the store. This bothered me, because I have a younger brother, about the same age difference. If it isn't bad enough that this store overcharges small children for PokÃ©mon and Digimon cards, they have no patience for them either. After I saw this, I had a word with the merchant. It was very upsetting for me to witness all of this. That was the las time I shopped at this store. I really would like to think that he was just having a bad day, but I am told by some of my younger brother's friends that the same man was used a harsh tone with them too. Also, similar to one of the other reports mentioned on here (from Joe) I would like to mention that I purchased a set of Ogeechee cards 88 hockey, and half the cards were Topps.

EA Sports takes you through their RMA process where they are quite helpful in getting your equipment replaced. I personally replaced 2-3 guitars and a drum set only to receive working ones in return without any modifications or upgrades to have the equipment break yet again. Now they did extend the RMA warranty on the rb1 equipment but it doesnÂ’t make up for the complete headaches and countless hours of shipping the stuff back over and over after you already spent $200 on the bundle. Now with the release of Rock band 2 EA Sports releases NEW equipment with upgraded modifications that supposedly fixed the issues from RB1. Ok all fine and dandy I'll just eat the first $200 I spent on RB1 equipment, throw it all in the dumpster and drop another $200 on the new and improved RB2 equipment. (Which I did by the way). Only to find a whole nest of new problems. The RB2 guitar is actually quite nice with its new strum bar and I havenÂ’t had any issues with it thus far. The drums on the other hand are a pile of junk. First off for reasons unknown they decided to make the drums wireless and make you use AA batteries instead of being able to use to xbox360 battery pack (xbox360 only) but they poorly designed it. Playing on the drums cause the batteries to loose contact causing the drums to shut off mid song. The drums pads also at time just stop working completely even though they are on and the guide button works. With all these issues you must also include the cross-talk problems between the pads causing pads to register a hit even when they aren't touched. Once again you may go through the RMA process to receive another drum set and to complete surprise have the same exact issues. So now I have dumped $400 into the Rock band game not counting all of the DLC I have purchased to go through the same exact problems as RB1. Do I now have throw out my RB2 equipment and spend another $200 on Rock band 3 when its released to have these issues fixed? These are the complaints of Rock band 2 on the official Rock band 2 forums with no response from EA Sports or Harmonic on the matter. (((link redacted))) These are just the complaints on the wireless drum set. Forums search will reveal numerous complaints from Rock band 1 and Rock band 2 alike. Damon Carthage, New York U.S.A.

I was skiing straight down on a blue run when suddenly one of my skis released without any apparent reason and flew sideways. I fell forward and face down. After I was helped out, it turned out that the reason for the release of the ski was that the heel part of the binding moved backwards by approximately a couple of inches.Â  I later found out that Canyon Sports rented me the skis with bindings that have been recalled more than a year before.Â  As a result of the accident I have experienced a spinal cord injury, had to limit the scope of my professional activities, and am facing possible cervical fusion surgery.",3688,762,763,0,I have tried by email and by phone to get with them on my papers for two scooter I bought each time they put me on hold and then hang up on me.

They sent an order number with delivery date which was about two weeks. About 2/3's of my order arrived with no explanation for the missing parts. I made several attempts to call but only a machine would answer and have me wait. It would eventually disconnect me. I finally was able to leave a message, but the call was not returned. I also sent several e-mails that were not answered. I located the phone # of the store and finally got thru to a person at the parts counter that did not want to talk to me about the online dept. I was passed on to the online supervisor who told me my missing parts were on back order. Note: this was 3 weeks after the order was placed. The supervisor told me the parts were sent and would arrive the following Monday and I would receive an e-mail confirmation and tracking number. I never got this and the parts arrived 3 days after promised. When I checked the package I found there was a part missing that I was charged for. I again left messages on the phone and e-mail. This time when I called the store I asked for the supervisor of the online dept. and was left on hold, then disconnected. It has been 3 days and I don't expect they will contact me.

I'm a die hard fan and retired cop from up there and having relocated far away from my team's market, they try to get me Yankee items which are hard to come by in the south. This year would be no different. Its important to note that I do not and would not otherwise subscribe to this magazine if they didn't offer these items, there are many other Baseball publications I would get before getting SI, period. So the night the Yanks clinched, I went to Yankees.com and there was an add from Sports Illustrated offering the following items if you signed up for a year's subscription. An Authentic 2009 World Series Baseball, A 2009 World Series DVD set and a special 2009 World Series Champion Yankees Book. I quickly signed up for the offer within only minutes of the final pitch in the Series, as soon as the Yankees had won (11-04-09)! A couple of days later, (while staying with my mother in the hospital) I got a confirmation email that I had subscribed, but the email indicated that I wasn't getting any of the Yankee World Series items described, but I was going to get an Athletic Tote Bag. I called Sports Illustrated customer service (from the hospital) because there was no way I would sign up for this magazine if not for the 3 items promised for said subscription. After waiting 30 minutes to actually talk to someone when I called, I told the customer service rep, what the email said and told him I did not want to order the magazine if not for the World Series Baseball, DVD and Book. He looked at my order and told me the email was an error and not to worry. He assured me that I would be getting the subscription and would get the (3) three gifts. Today, my very first issue of the magazine arrived along with an invoice for the subscription with monthly bills to submit for my subscription. As I was making out the check to return my payment, I looked close at the invoice and once again, there was no mention of the (3) Yankee World Series items. The invoice once again said that I would be getting an Athletic Tote Bag!! I called 1-800-528-5000 (customer service) which is located on the invoice. This time, once I was actually able to speak to someone (the only way you don't wait 30 minutes on hold is to press the number if you Want to place an order. If you select any other option such as Discuss your account your left on hold forever. So once I finally reached a human being to ask them what the problem was with my order, I was told that I was not going to get the Yankee items (the only reason for my order) but was going to get one of these other gifts. I told them this was a mistake, that I had placed the order on 11-04-09. The woman (Sandra who gave an Employee ID number of PXH) was extremely rude! She was rude and acted totally inconvenienced for the call the entire conversation. Here were the revelations she gave me for the problem. First, she is claiming I did not make the order as soon as it appeared on Yankee.com on 11-04-09. She is claiming that I didn't order the subscription until 11-09-09 which was wrong. She told me that because I didn't order when I said that I did and under the terms of the offer I made my order, that was the reason I would not get the Yankee items that were offered. She told me she could correct the problem, but because I didn't order my order the right way, that I could now only get (2) of the Yankee World Series items that I had been promised when I placed my order. I was told that she could now only send me the Yankee DVD and the Yankees World Series Book, but she couldn't let me have the World Series Baseball now.!!!! Here is the truth of the matter. Someone I talked to told me the reason they are doing this now, is because they are running out of the World Series Baseballs, so they have messed up many orders because they can't take care of all the orders and just want to give the DVD & Book but no WS Baseball. When I told this woman that I had been getting SI only when the Yankees have won the Series in years past, this fool had the nerve to say to me, Well, thatÂ’s not possible, because this is the very first year they have won the World Series!! What kind of people do they hire at a sports magazine that don't know that the Yankees have won more Championships then any other sports team in SPORTS HISTORY!! I was simply getting the run around and Sandra was just coming up with one excuse after another for Sports Illustrated not HONORING the terms of the offer which made me choose to purchase their product! She also claimed to be a supervisor and when I asked if they had a transcript or recording of the conversation I had with Customer Service the first time I called, I explained, THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE REP PROMISED ME I WOULD GET ALL (3) WORLD SERIES ITEMS, she refused to check that information and claimed I didn't place my order on 11-04-09, but on 11-09-09 which was wrong and wouldn't honor anything the other Customer Service Rep had promised in my previous call. I can't believe with all the subscriptions my family or I have made to this magazine back in 1996,1998,1999 or 2000 would act this way. It's just one more reason people should only buy this publication when there is something worth reading in ONE issue when it's on the stand. Don't subscribe to Sports Illustrated because they don't honor their promises and their customer service treats you like crap!",3693,768,769,1,"I ordered some parts for my motorcycle from the parts department and used my brand new Honda GE Money Bank Credit card to pay for them. They said that they would be there in a week. I went in to pick up the parts and they said they were on back order indefinitely, so they couldn't give me a date that they would be in. I told them to cancel the order and I gave them my Honda credit card and asked them to credit it back onto my account. They called the number on the card an entered some numbers over the phone. 30 days later I get a bill from Honda for parts (remember, I didn't get any parts). I went back to Metro Motorsports and explained what happened. They said they were sorry and they would correct the mistake. It took about an hour, but they dug up my paperwork and called the credit card Co. and said it was taken care of. 30 days later, You guessed it, another bill this time with a late fee added for the parts I didn't get. I went back to the store again and talked with someone in the accounting department. She said she would call Honda credit and call me back on Monday. She did call me and she said it was finally taken care of. 30 days later, I get another bill with 2 late fees for the parts I never received. Plus It went on my credit report as a 30 and 60 day late. I was in the process of buying a home so it caused my credit scores to go down and I ended up paying a higher interest and more fees for my home loan. After approximately 4 months, I finally got GE Money Bank to remove all charges and fees. I asked them to correct the credit report and they said that they couldnÂ’t and that I would have to fill out forms to correct it. I tried, but the reporting agencies said that I would have to get GE Money Bank to report that it was their error. They said that they changed the credit report, but it is still on there as a 30 day late. I have tried many times to get it changed, but to no avail. My Advice is, don't buy anything from Metro Motorsports with a (Honda Card-GE Money Bank). Honda Financial services is OK and I have had no problems with them.Â ",3694,769,770,0,"I just bought a 2006 ford Taurus for my wife and our new son, and i thought with the baby coming and the summer here I might as wee tint the windows to help keep the car cooler and the baby from sun burning.

There was several delays with the uniforms and when I called to inquire they could never give me a straight answer and made me feel like I was inconveniencing them with my call. Never once did they apologize for the delay. When our pant order came in, 2 pairs of the pants came in 1 pair being too big and the other for another player being to small. We requested them be replaced with the right size to fit them in March 2011 and to date still have not received them. These 2 boys have had to go the entire season without their pants and not matching the team. Today is June 14, and we still have not received the 2 pairs of pants and the 11 bat bags we have paid for. We only have 2 tournaments left and our season will be over.

No refund has been received to this date!!I finally got a response from one of the owners named John from an email I sent. He stated in the email that he was told we already received our bags. He said who's lying here. Then after a couple of emails he said he told them to offer me black bags instead of the ones we ordered and said he was told that I said no, we already have new bags (this is Lie, we don't have new bags. Several kids have broken bags).The head coach told him in an email he wanted a call back from him or he would get an lawyer involved. Of course he never called him but responded rudely to his email. He said this isnÂ’t about the kids they have 95% of there things. He said if you are worried about their bags then go buy them some more.

I tried to contact them, but when I called their automated answering service came on saying their offices were closed until SEPTEMBER 3RD! I then emailed many times and still got no response. I immediately alerted my bank of the fraudulent charges and got my money refunded to me (minus the initial registration fee). I saw no information on their website as to another way to contact them so I turned to Facebook where I saw they had a page. I commented asking many questions about the charges and the fact that I'd received no information about the upcoming season. They told me they were not responsible for the charges and they are in the process of making a new website. Those answers weren't good enough for me. I went back to their Facebook page days later and noticed I wasn't able to leave comments anymore. I found this odd so I created another account and went back to their page. Sure enough, I was able to comment using this new account. They apparently BLOCKED me for wanting answers! Here it is, September, and nothing has been resolved. They claim to have everything worked out and have even began offering people free registration. They have closed their phone lines and only provide you the option to email them.

Â  At tryouts this year their website stated that Teams would be assigned at the end of the night. That didn't happen.Â  Instead they assigned the girls to either Regional or Local but no actual team or coach until October.Â  You are required to pay $550 at tryouts and an additional $1000 before you even have a team assigned.Â  I spoke with the person in charge of finances at tryouts and told her I wasn't comfortable paying money up front without knowing her team/coach.Â  Â The employee (Lizzi) stated not to worry, that I could sign up today (which included signing a commitment form and $550 check) and she would be holding the checks in her office for a few weeks.Â  She said I could come in and speak with her and if I wasn't happy at the end of the conversation I could just take my check with me.Â  Â After being told this, I decided to take her word, fill out the paperwork and pay the money. Â When I went to speak with her about a week later, I was not happy with how the conversation went.Â  I asked her for the check back and she stated that the owner had come in and taken the checks and deposited them.Â  She said that she could not approve a refund and although she told me I could have my money back at tryouts there is nothing she could do.Â  She said she would ask the owner.Â  The owner, Jeff, replied, We will not refund your deposit. Unfortunately you do want to not honor your commitment and you leave us no choice but to take this action. These were his exact words.

Since that date I have had numerous problems with the motorcycle which reflect that the bike was not serviced nor inspected prior to me purchasing it on above listed date. Description of repairs since purchase date: Replaced front and rear brakes (No life left on existing pads) Replaced fork seals (existing seals were leaking) Replaced rear bearings (squeak noise coming from rear of bike, said replacement didnÂ’t take the obnoxious squeak sound away) Replacement of Headlight wiring assembly (short which caused headlight electrical assembly to melt and smoke profusely) SAFETY HAZARD!! *Full Service Completed! (Due to one not being done prior to sale date) Rear sprocket retainer installed to eliminate squeak noise/rubbing noise. Replaced rear drive belt. (snapped while driving down the road) Granted all repairs after purchase date were paid for by the store manager at Coleman Power Sports, however that donÂ’t change the fact that I have a bad taste in my mouth due to the countless issues that have surfaced after purchase date. This bike has been nothing but problematic for me and my patience is running thin as I have displayed endless amount of professionalism and patience till this point.

First we browsed the clothing section, and we saw a baseball jersey that I liked. My girlfriend held on to it and was considering to purchase it. I decided that I wanted to go the basketball section, while she was looking at clothing. She tried a few items on, and she decided not to make a purchase. We proceeded to walk to the exit, and as soon as we got outside a man walked up to my girlfriend and tried to take her pocketbook, and a struggle took place as I was helping my girlfriend pull her pocketbook away from the man. As soon as we pulled her purse away from him, he then accused us of stealing merchandise from the store. We walked to my car and drove away, and my girlfriend wanted to go to the police and report what had just occurred, but I simply just told her to forget about what happened. A few hours later, police came to my house with an arrest warrant, CHARGING ME WITH ROBBERY!!! This is the same charge you get when you rob a bank. First off, the security sensors did not go off, so when the man who did not identify himself attempted to snatch my girlfriend's purse, we refused to give it to him simply because we had no idea who he was, what he was doing, and why he was doing it. If he had came up to us and identified himself as a security officer, and asked to search her purse, we simply would have shown the security guard her purse. Second of all, I have spent hundreds of dollars in that store, and the many of the employees know me, simply from purchasing products there on a daily basis. On top of all of this, me and my girlfriend's name appeared in the local newspaper, Destroying our reputation completely.

In the box was the hat I originally sent back to them along with a note that said the hat had Slight staining on the inside brim and did not meet the RETURN POLICY Of course, we called them by phone and reach a person that hung up and we called again and that person said THE HAT MEETS REEBOK SPECIFICATIONS Well after calling REEBOK and On Field Apparel, the company who handles the NFL division of Reebok we were told that ABSOLUTELY NOT, A DEFECTIVE HAT DOESN'T MEET OUR SPECIFICATIONS They are in the process of investigating BestSportsApparel.com and how they are representing Reebok along with our dilemma. All we wanted was a replacement for the defective hat. I wasn't asking for money back, just a replacement! My request fell into their return policy of 30 days if that matters for a defective product and the smudge on the inside brim is barely noticeable as if that matters. As if it could be sold to another customer anyway or was that BestSportsApparel.coms intentions! So much for customer service! Beware of ordering from BestSportsApparel.com.

Pep Boys did the assembly and there was a part missing. It took a month to get the part. They also shipped the wrong gas cap for the cart, so fuel leaked while driving it creating a very dangerous situation. We had about 2 hours on the vehicle, when it stopped going forward. It needed a new clutch, fortunately it was under warranty. Once that was repaired, we brought it to our summer camp in another state. The kids were riding, and the front steering knuckle snapped and made it impossible to turn the wheel. That was replaced because I emailed Pep Boys and told them how dissatisfied I was with this purchase. They acquired the parts for me. I repaired the Go-Kart and it was ridden for 1/2 hour and the Drive Belt burned out, putting it on the sidelines again. Complaints sent to Baja go unanswered, phone calls to order parts force me to be on the phone for 25-45 on Hold. I feel ripped off and so annoyed that this thing is such a piece of crap.

After numerous calls and with my banks help the 1308.05 was credited back to my account... I waited days and days for the atv or some info and finally I attempted to cancel the order. This was to no avail. They refused to answer email and the phone lines were continually busy. On June 10, I received a call drom Estes trucking saying that they were to deliver the atv that day. I hired four people to come to my home and help unload. I could see at once that something was wrong. There were no front or rear racks, no locking system and the color was wrong. When I began assembly, my troubles really began. It would not start because of a faulty solenoid. I managed to crank it with a screwdriver. Then the coil went out. The entire firing system was gone. I managed to get that repaired at my expense, When my daughter tried to ride it, she came walking back. It had stopped and would not start. I towed it home and tried to check it out.. At least 8 nuts and bolts were missing from different places. The next day, the sprocket came loose and the chain broke. I had a friend repair that...

It is obvious that this is an intentional action by Roadrunner Sports to bill unsuspecting former customers who might overlook this charge. When you call them to dispute the charge, you are greeted by a pre-recorded message cheerfully explaining that the recent charge on your card is just a renewal fee for your extremely valuable membership but if you would like to speak to someone about that charge just press 1. While they quickly agree to refund the charge (as yet I have not seen it!), this only serves to confirm that they are mass billing former customers hoping to pick up some free cash from those people to whom $24.99 is not the sort of charge that rings alarm bells (Maybe I really did renew that membership, whatever it is?). Any argument from them would only send customers to the BBB in droves. If they do not respond soon, I will dispute the charge through my credit card company and submit a report to the California BBB.

My husband and I sailed on the Getaway on June 12, 2017. First, the crew was very nice and our cabin was small but very clean. We had a balcony cabin. However, this ship is enormous. It took a significant amount of time to return to the ship after shore excursions. Also, we missed two ports of call because the ship could not get into Warnemunde in Germany for a day and a half. The weather would not permit the ship to enter the harbor. We went into Warnemunde a day late which meant that we missed the tours we booked. Then, we had to skip a call at Tallinn. So we missed our tour there as well. Other, smaller ships were able to get into ports.
The shore excursions that we were able to take were very good. However, the ship is just too large with very little quiet space or educational entertainment. There was no one aboard to provide information on the places that we were about to see. Most of the venue on the ship are crowded and very noisy. Big party crowd. The large scale entertainment was very good but no smaller groups. Ship has climbing wall, rope course, etc... good for families but not for people wanting intellectual stimulation. Lots of stupid game shows etc... Food was reasonably decent but not great.

At present I am an Automotive Importer for a Car Dealership that specializes in selling American Cars and trucks, in Italy. In early Nov. 2008, I wired money to Cleburne Motor Sports for the purchase of a 2006 Dodge Ram SRT. The person that I contacted at the dealership was Julie Clark. In the past 4 years I have bought over 100 vehicles in the US all by way of the internet, and have never had a problem till now. Julie provided me not only with her International Banking coordinates, but also with the name of someone at her Bank that I could correspond with to make sure that the money I was wiring, arrived. After, a lengthy delay I finally got word from Julie's Bank that the money had finally arrived. That's when everything started to go wrong! Julie informed me that Robert her husband had sold my vehicle to someone else. A little mad, I then asked her to do the right thing and wire me back my money through her Bank. I was told by Julie that the money had gone into another account (lies!), and that it would take time to sort out! She assured me in an e-mail that she would never think of keeping my money. However, I know for a fact that all they (Robert or Julie) have to do, is go into their Bank and sign an Authorization form to start the re-wire back to Italy. This was confirmed to me by their Bank Representative. They still have not done this!!! The biggest problem I am having is getting in touch with them. I have 2 Office Numbers: 1-866-728-9651 & 1-817-641-7502 2 Cell Numbers: 1-817-202-5844 & 1-817-992-8068 1 Fax Number: 1-817-202-9460 and 1 e-mail address: I am amazed that with all these Numbers that I cannot get a hold of them!

I have filed a complaint with the Texas Department of Transport and am getting daily feedback from their Bank.

I have been told that because the prize value is based on a full rate value... When they never sell at that price. The only logic I can see is they use the opportunity to manage tournaments prize (again Norwegian Cruise didn't contribute) to sell to the winner a cabin at full price. I don't find that fair.

It's too bad because I loved my cruise, everything was perfect beside this.",3757,837,838,2,"During December 2008 my daughter purchased (2) pocket bikes from USA Power Sports. I was at a military deployment class and did not get to assemble the bikes until I got home the week of Christmas. In assembling them I found both of the bikes had leaks in both gas tanks and closer inspection found cracks in the pull starter or motor case. I tried calling the company and all I got was a recording. When I finally got hold of someone from the company (female sales person) I was promptly informed that I needed to read the warranty agreement before buying their bikes and that since gas had been put in the tanks this made the bikes used and they could not be returned to the company. To no avail would the person let me talk to their manager, or help with the problem of returning defective equipment. Especially since other bikes had been purchased so the grandkids would not be disappointed at Christmas. Since then (January 02, 2009) my daughter finally got an e-mail answer that we could make pictures of the damage and they would validate or replace what was damaged. All I want is my money back for bikes that did not work.Â ",3758,838,839,1,"I'm Glad I found this web site so I can vent my frustration with All New Sports of Newton, KS. This company is the worst I've ever dealt with and if anybody out there who would be interested in starting a class action suit against these folks then sign me up! I bought a 150CC J M Star scooter in June of 2008 from these guys. After only 1,500 miles under very conservative driving and regular maintenance, the main motor bearing shattered. After pushing it about 3 miles to my home, I contacted All New Sports about my situation. It took several phone calls (phone calls go directly to voice mail, nobody personally answers incoming calls) and emails for somebody to get back to me. I informed them of the failure and was told to send the engine back to them for repair. The warranty would only cover parts and return shipment. So I took to a motorcycle shop and they pulled the engine and repaired a stuck kick starter. The cost of the labor was $180.00. I took the engine, boxed it up securely and shipped it to All New Sports at cost of $70.00. It arrived on January 9th, 2009. I was told by their tech support manager (John) that it would be repaired and returned to me in about 30 days. OK, fair enough. After a couple of weeks I had not heard a thing so I emailed and called them several times to inquire about my repair. I heard nothing back after a few days so I kept trying. Finally, I got an email stating they were waiting for a part. I inquired again about more detail but heard nothing. After several more calls and emails, I finally received an email stating that I was to be patient and the repair will be completed in due time. After 1 month I still had not heard anything so I called and emailed again with no response. It took another week before I received another email stating my repair is going fine and I will be updated at a later time. So, I waited again. Another month went by and I had not heard anything despite continued emails and phone calls. By chance one day in early March, 2009 (2 months after they received my motor for repair) I finally got through and spoke to an actual human being in customer service. She told me they will look into my repair and tech support would call me back. I called again the next day and got the same response, yet nobody would follow up with me. At this point I have had it with being jerked around! I called again and expressed my discontent with their service and demanded to talk to a supervisor, manager or owner. I was refused and was told that the owner does not talk to customers! After a week I got an email stating my repair is going fine and should be shipped out within a day or two. That was reassuring but I was skeptical. Finally, I got a call from the tech support manager (Colby) and he asked me what was the problem with my engine! What???? They've had my engine for 2 months, I faxed them the repair analysis from my mechanic and now they ask me what is wrong? As it turned out my engine sat in a corner for 2 month and nobody even looked at it!! Needless to say, I was furious and let them know how poor their service is and again asked to speak to the owner. Again, I was refused. At this point all I wanted was my engine repaired, sent back to the cycle shop and move on with my life. The engine finally arrived in late March, 2009 to the cycle shop. It was poorly packed in a plastic moving tub and only wrapped in a U-Haul moving blanket. It didn't look very good and I could only hope it survived the shipment and would work. The cycle shop put the engine back in and fired it up... it worked! However, the mechanic informed me that this engine was not mine because it has California emissions on it AND the kick starter needed repairing! I already paid him for the repair of the kick starter on my engine, now I paid again to repair the kick starter on a replacement engine they had sent me! The final bill for the repair was another $280.00. This combined with my earlier repair and shipment added up to a grand total of $430.00. The scooter retailed at $1,200. I paid for the same repair twice AND All New Sports didn't inform me that they were sending me somebody else's engine!!! My engine had only 1,500 miles on it and I have no idea the condition of the engine or how many miles on it or even if it will last. I suspect they stripped my newer engine for parts and gave me some older engine and called it good enough! At this point, I am completely unsatisfied with my customer experience with All New Sports. I will contact the Kansas Attorney General and file a complaint with them. If anybody out there has similar stories like this and want to start a class action suit then I all ears! ALL NEW SPORTS IS A RIP OFF AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST. THEY STOLE MY ENGINE!!!!Â ",3759,840,841,1,"On 5/5/08 I ordered a 250cc Ronoco motorscooter from Allnewsports.com per phone. I paid $2376.95 for the scooter with a lifetime warranty. My battery went dead several times since I purchased the scooter. On July 23, 2008 I emailed the parts department at parts@allnewsports.com & their service department at service@allnewsport.com. I received an email from Carl M, Parts Manager, stating that I needed to send the voltage regulator back to them. I sent, by certified mail the bad VR which was received by them on July 28, 2008. When I spoke to them on the phone they indicated that it would take about 5 days to return to me a new VR. On 8.1.08 I sent an email to Carl M asking when I will receive my new VR. On 8.4.08 Carl M emailed me stating that I should get my new regulator within 10-12 days. It's been 16 days now and I am still waiting for my VR. I have tried to call them, but all phones go to voicemail. Since July 28, they have had 16 days to return a new VR to me. I sent an email on 8.11 asking when I can expect my VR. I tried to call them today but my phone call went to voicemail. I did leave a message but have not had a response as of yet. I feel that Allnewsports.com has not lived up to their warranty expectations/conditions. I feel that Allnewsports.com should uphold their warranty that they are selling with the scooters and they need to be more responsive to consumers that they have sold scooters to. If Allnewsports.com is not going to honor their lifetime warranty, they need to cease selling it and refund my money for the warranty. I paid $179 for a lifetime warranty. Kansas Corporations Division has this entity dissolved as a business. Business Entity ID number 4022182 has been dissolved with the Kansas Secretary of State. All new sports has changed their website to be exclusively ATVs. I have found another web site called www.alitescooters.com. The lay out is the same as what allnewsports.com was. I was searching through alit scooters vehicles FAQ's and under What do I do if my order is lost or damaged and on the reply #2 & 3 states: All noted damages must be reported to allnewsports.com via e-mail within 3 days of delivery, no exceptions. 3. Please save original packing material for investigation by the shipping company. Please take pictures of the damaged boxes and vehicle and send the pictures to parts@allnewsports.com within 3 days of delivery. So, why is alit scooters using allnewsports.coms email addresses? I read where another consumer contacted alitescooters.com and he was told to contact allnewsports.com. Something is not right about both these sites. I have made complaints with the Federal Trade Commission, the Washington State Attorney Genreal, Consumer Protection Division and the Kansas State Attorney General, Consumer Protection Divisions office, and have lodged a complaint with the BBB. If there is an E-Commerce site that I can make a complaint to, I wish I knew what it was, because I would make a complaint there as well.Â ",3760,841,842,1,I paid for a new x22 pocket bike automatic.

When I got home the charge of $7.67 was on my credit card, plus another charge. I called Norwegian, they said the other charge was for another beer charge on the last day of the cruise. So I got charged for two beers, plus I was lied to. Either someone got into my room and took two beers or Norwegian is creating a scam on their customers like Well Fargo did.

If you will indulge me, I have a couple of questions I did not see on your website: Is it possible to lose money instead of earning the 5% you promise? If so, how is that possible? If it's not possible to lose money, how is that possible? I mean, it IS based on gambling, right? If it's not possible to lose money, why hasn't the world financial market jumped on board, totally redefining the way the world does business? Regarding the account you describe, is that an account that your company keeps for me, or are you merely referring to my E-Gold account? Also, is there a way to access and/or monitor the progress online through a website somehow on a real-time, daily basis? If I am some how ripped of in this process, how do I legally protect myself since I am not an English citizen in the (hopefully) unlikely event that you don't do what you say you will do? (I am an American who currently resides in the Philippines.) If you can answer these questions to my satisfaction, I will be happy to open an account immediately with your firm to see how this goes. Thanks in advance for taking the time to answer these questions questions that I am sure you probably answer all the time. I look forward to a long and prosperous future together.",3780,864,865,0,"I had a friend who went to MM to purchase a motorcycle (Cr250) and the sales guys told him that they couldnÂ’t finance the bike unless he put $1,000.00 down on it. Well my friend didnÂ’t have the cash to do that so he told them it he didnÂ’t want to do the deal. They proceeded on by telling him they could just say that he put the money down and everything would be taken care of. He didnÂ’t go home with the bike that day but about a month later he gets a bill in the mail for the bike (his first months payment) He decides to call them and find out whatÂ’s going on since he didnÂ’t even have the bike. They tell him that he needs to come pick it up since he bought it. So him and I drive down there and (By) the guy in charge in sales office looks over at us and says so your back to pick up the bike? and my friend tell him yeah sure... they By says well give us our money(the $1000.00) and take it, if you donÂ’t have it get out of here I don't want to play Fucking games. so my friend and I walk out empty handed and confused. He never picked up the bike, He did receive a few more bills in the mail for it though. As a side note I have personally experienced bad customer service and heard many other horror storyÂ’s from the motorsports companyÂ’s.",3781,866,867,1,"I contacted the sky dive place on 1/10/06 to schedule a dive for my father in law who is going to be 100 in Feb. He wanted to dive on Feb 18th in Greenville. I called and made reservations and he was charged $287.70 on his Mastercard. They called back the next day and said that the drop zone in Greenville was unavailable at that time and we would have to drive to Rome Ga, which is across the state (we are on the east side and it on the west). I told them I would like to have a refund and they said it was non-refundable because I didn't pay the extra $32.50 at the time of purchase. Well, who knows that they would want to cancel at time of purchase? I offered to pay the 32.50 at the time of the refund request and they said I could not. It is only available at the time of purchase. In the meantime I contacted Flying tigers of Clemson and told him of my dilemma. He said Oh No Not you too!. He told me that this company I paid WAS NOT a Skydiving company and that the reason we could not use the drop zone in Greenville is because it had closed in 2000. He told me to contact the US Para trooping Assoc. in Va. and report them which I did. The US Par. Assn. Told me to call the credit card company Immediately and deny those charges. AND to contact the The Atty Generals office and report it so I did. I contacted the credit card company again and they are going to send me paperwork to fill out. In the meantime, I made reservations with the Flying Tigers of Clemson for him to make his dive. They only accept cash at the time of the drop, just in case it rains etc. These people need to have their website pulled and made to refund all monies to the people that have NO IDEA of who they are dealing with until the credit card number is given them. If I have to, I will let my father in law press charges against me for using his number without his permission (which he did give me his card to do this with). I want to see them brought in to court upon charges of Fraud. If anyone else has had this same problem and received their refund, please let me know. Thanks.",3782,867,868,1,"I have copied the letter I wrote to this company, it is below and has all the details of their scam. In a nutshell, we ordered a GO CART. When the Go Cart arrived it had incomplete instructions and missing parts. WE had professionals attempt to assemble it, this took TWO WEEKS at which they determined that it was a defective product and should be sent back. ALL NEW Sports will not except the product back citing that we had it beyond 7 days......They have a BUYSAFE guarantee which they will not UPHOLD!!!THEY BLOCKED his ability to email them. My child is devastated having waited years for the day that he would finally get a Go Cart and now that the day arrived, the Go cart is a piece of crap!!! We spent 2500.00 to find out that this company scams people! DON'T BUY FROM THESE SCAMMERS!!! Letter written August 31, 2007 to All New Sports, we purchase a Go Cart from you at the end of July 2007. My son was so excited and waited for the cart to arrive in excited suspense... We received the cart on August 10, 2007. I had a mechanic come to my home and attempt to assemble it. I called you that afternoon with a complaint. 1. The instructions were absolutely the most ridiculous instructions and completely no help. 2. There seems to be missing hardware. Your customer service rep was very rude and insisted that I am not mechanically inclined. He stated that, Your company suggests that all their customers take the carts to professionals to assemble them. He also stated that the directions are Chinese American and always come that way... everyone has a problem with them. He said then instructed me to call technical support and hung up on me. My questions to you are: 1. If you insist that you customers take the carts to professionals, how much time do you think it would take to have the professionals assemble them? They usually can not stop what they are doing just for your cart, they do have other business to attend too... It does take time to get it to and from the professionals as well... Do you really think a week is enough time for this???? 2. If YOU KNOW everyone has a problem with your instructions, why do you keep sending them out???? Why do you not add extra time onto your return policy if you know the instructions are a joke?? 3. Why are your people so rude to customers? I did as your customer service rep instructed and I called Technical support who informed me that they would research the directions and email us a copy. We waited over 24 hours and did not hear back from them. On Saturday, the 11th, I called back your customer support and complained again. This time I was told to call back Technical support and that they will walk us through the assembly. We had another mechanic over (now there are TWO working on this cart) and called back Tech support. Your tech support asked my mechanic to hold the line and NEVER came back onto the phone!! After three days of working on this cart, my two mechanics gave up and suggested that we ship it to a shop that specializes in rebuilding, modifying and problem Carts. My son was devastated with the time that he had to wait. He can see the cart but he can't touch it, it was crushing him with each passing day. We had to book an appointment for this specialty mechanic. It took us 4 days until we could get in. The cart was shipped over to them and was in their care for over a week. Finally they called and told us that they had worked consistently on the cart, and they still cannot get it up and running. They stated that there are so many problems with it and it must be returned. They backed this statement in writing. Again my son was devastated... now the cart will never work??? Now he has to wait for this one to be sent back and a new one to arrive?? My husband called your company and then followed up with an email. He explained the issues with the cart and the fact that we need to return it, as we have exhausted every other possibility. Your response was that we had it over the 7 day limit and then you BLOCKED HIS EMAIL ADDRESS!!! (email attached) What kind of company does that??? Definitely not a reputable one!!! The entire time we had this cart it has been in the assembly stage, it has never been run and CAN'T EVER BE....We literal did everything in our power to fix this cart and it can not be......It must be returned and we will fight you for this rip off if you do not comply with YOUR PROMISES FOR A SAFE TRANSACTION. I am writing to BUYSAFE, BBB and RIPOFF REPORT.COM. I have PHONE RECORDS, and MECHANIC's RECORDS to back us....we will not stop until you make the arrangements for this cart to be picked up and refund our money back...It is so obvious that you have a 7 day return policy because you know that it will take over 7 days until your customers find out that your Carts are a rip off and by then, it is too late, according to YOU, to return them. Is that why your all NEW sports???? It is businesses like yours which make Internet transactions unsafe. Can't you find a way to make money LEGIMATELY?? Don't you realize it is little children that are getting the raw end of your unethical business transactions???? If you would have cooperated and backed your promises, we would have exchanged the Go Cart with one that actually worked but instead you were rude, underhanded and unethical. Christina, Letter from My husband, Dear Jeff I'm not satisfied with your product period. I will return it as never used. The agreement for warranty and the return policy were just received on August 20th asking me to sign and return. Why would you send me this document if I had already agreed? As for the 7 day return policy the product was not received until August 10th. Assembly was conducted immediately following and your customer service department was notified of the issues. In fact your office attempted to give instructions over the phone and I might add were perceived as rude and reluctantly cooperative. Once again, I am requesting you accept this return for a full reimbursement. The product will be prepared for shipping by Friday, August 24th. Once again I am requesting that you honor this return. The integrity of All New Sports as well as ethical business practice is what is in question. I look forward to your cooperation in this matter.Â ",3783,868,869,2,"We were at Sports Authority and needed heavy socks for boots. I found three identical pair of socks in a clearance bin but only one of the packages were marked as $4.97, regular price was $12.99. When we went to check out, all of the socks rang up at $13.99 ($1.00 more than the regular price tag) and the cashier refused to adjust the price and suggested that we or someone else must have put the clearance tag on the one pair. I was of course furious and very embarrassed at her accusation. She called a manager who also refused to alter the price, then the store manager(Jim) suggested that someone put the socks in the bin and one of the clearance tags had been put on the socks, then also refused to alter the price on the two pair that didn't have clearance price tags on them, even though the three were identical! I'm really frustrated about this because anywhere you go, the retailer will adjust prices if there is a mistake, obviously Sports Authority doesn't care about being fair to their customers. I'm waiting to hear from their district manager at this point.",3784,869,870,1,Ordered a pair of hockey skates. Credit card was charged immediately during the order process! (this was already a bad sign.) Aret Carlson sends me an email informing me item is on backorder and will not ship for three weeks! I promptly respond asking for a shipping address change since I was not expecting such a long delivery time. Get no response. Two weeks later send another email to customer service asking for order status. No response. Phone number is disconnected. On the promised shipped date I send another email asking for shipping confirmation and tracking number. No response. I did some research and found that they have an unsatisfactory rating with their local BBB. Three weeks later still no response and no hockey skates. Phone number still disconnected. Called credit card company which is now investigating. Don't do business with this company.,3785,870,871,1,"On April 5, 2007, we complained to their accounts department regarding a change on my husband's account - renewing automatically his membership after his one-year contract expired - $599.00 for a year - and all of a sudden our VISA was charged $83.74. Stephanie at accounting filed up a request for refund form, indicating that the refund would be processed in 30 -60 days. I spoke to Stephanie, after leaving several messages were that went unreturned, who told me her supervisor did not approved the request. During our meeting in April she never indicated that the request needed to be approved, nor did anyone ever notified of this refusal to return our money. According to the consumer protection act they needed to provide my husband with a registered letter or a hand delivered letter requesting his signature before any further transactions were made, since he paid for a year in advanced and his membership expired, thus making the contract void. I have requested a copy of the above documents (i.e., letters with my husband's signature) and I was told that the contract overrode the consumer protection act and this was not required. Under present legislation, this is fraud, so I would like to make other consumers aware of it.",3786,871,872,1,"National Sports Services is posting false ads on the internet. Many times, they are stating under the pictures of their employee or after you click on the purchase now button; If this game doesn't win, you receive his picks for the rest of the week for FREE. Or: If my GUARANTEED winner doesn't win, you will receive my picks for the rest of the month for FREE. If one of their games loses, they do not e-mail the customer with his, or her, free pick the following day. They do not telephone the customer and give him, or her, their free pick the next day. Therefore, the customer who purchased National Sports Services supposed winner is the one who has to make contact with National Sports Service the next day. By having the customer initiate the contact. National Sports Services is able to make it appear as if the customer is contacting them to make a purchase. This couldn't be further from the truth. Once the consumer initiates the contact, National Sports Services has the opportunity to start using selling pressure on the consumer. This also gives them the opportunity to make it appear as if you are getting a deal that is too good to be true. National Sports Services got the opportunity to tell me that Dave Cokin has inside information on games that other people don't have. Yeah. Right. And, if you buy his season package, you will get his over/under picks for the rest of the baseball season. Some people have to pay $1,000 just to get Dave's over/under pick in one game! Yeah. Sure! Then they get you to give them your credit card numbers. If you don't have enough credit available, National Sports Services starts asking questions like: Don't you have another credit card we could use? Don't you have a savings account? Where is your money? Is your money in stocks? Meanwhile, National Sports Services is getting away with FALSE ADVERTISING. Did National Sports Services give me my free pick on June 19th as promised? Only after they charged around $26,000 to my credit cards. You call that FREE? I made purchases at National Sports Services of $29 on June 8th, $15 on June 13th, $25 on June 15th and $25 on June 18th. The June 13th and 15th purchases were guaranteed winners. They won. Therefore, I didn't have to call National Sports Services on the following days. However, Dave Cokin's June 18th GUARANTEED winner, LOST! Why would I want to spend $40,000 at National Sports Services On June 19th and 20th, the 2 days following a Dave Cokin LOSER? I didn't spend anything the 2 days that followed Dave Cokin wins. (June 14th and June 16th) This all was a result of SALES PRESSURE. If these guys are not crooks, how come they have to state 3 times on the bottom of their contract: We are freeing them from any claims whatsoever. And, all money is non-refundable. Football Season doesn't even start until August 1st! I paid $20,000 for their football season picks because of their SALES PRESSURE. What does football season have to do with the FREE baseball games that they promised in their June 18th ad?Â ",3787,872,873,1,I called to cancel card and their automated services takes you in circles until it says it doesn't recognize your response. Over and over I tried different things until finally I got a person on the phone and they sent me a check for the 130 minus the monthly fee for the card I had less than 24 hrs. They said it be 2 weeks on Sept. 8. On Oct 1 I called again and they sent my money to a different state altogether. So still waiting... Never again will I use this brand or product. And I urge everyone to save their money and their time. GREENDOT is a joke and SCAM artists.,3788,874,875,2,"I submitted the following review regarding a Lodge 6 Quart Dutch Oven purchased online from Academy. I was cool with the result of the deal until they rejected my online review for not fitting their undefined posting requirements. Apparently they screen out all negative comments, which stinks to high heaven. Ordered one as a present for my wife for Christmas, and had it shipped. The over packing was astounding, roughly the side of a small refrigerator. The box inside looked fine, so I just wrapped it and all was well, until it was opened. Much of the enamel had been chipped off during shipping, and it was still flaking off, rendering it les than useless. We returned and exchanged it at a nearby store and noticed all of the nice packing in the second one that was not present in the first. Love the product and the price was great, but it was a royal pain to get a good one. Definitely will never ask for anything to be shipped from Academy again, and the trip to replace it has left a permanent stain on any repeat efforts.",3789,875,876,1,"When you come in the front of this sports bar, you are thinking you can watch sports enjoy your food and drink, but if you really care about your health, go in there on any given day you may see the food in boxes on the floor, dishes sitting in cold water, or even worse see the prep cooks with no hair nets, and no gloves being worn while your food is being prepared. if you see the 3-dish sink it leaks more than a strainer! And only one faucet that works! And also look in the coolers and it might you re-think what you choose to eat, there are no slip mats so watch your step the floors are always. Oily and slippery, and the owner gives more reasons as to why it hasn't been fixed than fixing them. The only thing he cares about is how much he makes on weekend sales, and he underplays everybody except himself, his wife and the chef everyone else gets a little above min. Wage.

I ordered a 50 cc Dirt Bike and a 50 cc ATV. What I got was a damaged 90cc Dirt Bike and a 110 cc ATV. Since they were presents I did not try to use them till after Christmas. The ATV would not start. They told me to jump with car. It still would not start. they told me to call manufacture TaoTao. The guy dave told me to thank them they voided my warranty. They told me to take to machine shop I did. The guy was less than thrilled to work on it. He could not get it to work either. I contacted BBB State Attorney General still waiting. I do not recomend buying from these guys the are not helpful. The product does not work it should be replaced. Not to mention neiter is what I paid for. I would live with dirt bike being to big but now my kids canÂ’t ride anything.Â ,3791,877,878,1,"They claim they have a double money back guarantee if they do not show you a profit. Well with exact records and showing they were not even close to a profit, I got sent through hoops and still never received anything. After sending about 5 e-mails, there was not a reply until i did a money dispute through PayPal. Then they call back and want to talk, ask me to mail something to another department and yet only one person answered the phone when they did answer. Their manager is suppose to be Toni, but he couldn't tell me anything. After mailing, e-mailing and calling, there was very delayed replies and i have not seen a penny back. I highly recommend staying away from this company period. They are not even a 45% winner. Stay away from John Fina and winning way sports.",3792,878,879,2,"I placed an order online with Road Runner Sports a couple days with my VIP account and utilized a VIP discount code. Today, when I checked my bank statement, I noticed an unauthorized charge of $20 from Road Runner Sports. Upon contacting them, I was informed that my VIP membership had expired at in 2011; they could not explain why my VIP status was still active on the website. Rather than call to inform me of this or cancel my order, they opted to make an unauthorized charge to my credit card. For the record, Road Runner made an unauthorized charge to my credit card in 2011 as well, which is why I had not shopped with them since. After two unauthorized charges to my card, I won't be shopping there again.",3793,879,880,1,"Â Grant sports global will contact you for sports investing. They claim that their information on games are so solid that you are not gambling on games. They have different levels of packages to pay for this information on sports. They then keep in contact with you on which games to move money on but when you ask what the inside information is they will not give that out. If you pay for the information you should get it. They will want an upfront payment for sports picks and will guarantee that you win. If you win they want a percentage but if you lose you will never hear from them. Be careful with this company, they will make it sound like you will make tons of money with virtually no risk. When i asked the representative if the company is so good then why is he working for them and not using their service. He responds with i get the information for free while working for the company, that is the perk, but he's also says he's been there for 20 years. If the information was that good he would be retired in 5 years. I did a $100 trial week and didnÂ’t get any games. The next week when I called them on it they said to wait till the weekend.

Then they prepare childish and tacky brochures they send out to your teamsÂ’ friends and family. They solicit donations. The donations are then withheld from you for months, if not years. They say all sorts of BS about how YOU didnÂ’t follow their rules, so you must pay them. They will send your account to collections. They basically con you into giving them your friends and families address, then they keep the donations those people intended for the loved one on the sports team. If you get any finds, they will be a quarter of what the families donated to you, and it will be months and months late.Â This company also has an extremely high employee turnover rate. They are frauds all around. I recently tried to find an address- turns out they closed that location and are operating out of a PO box now. FISHY! They also keep changing the name of their company.Â Do yourself a favor- ask for donations yourself- without the cheesy and immature letters. You can easily set up a PayPal account and accept your own donations that way. Steer clear of this disgusting scam.",3798,884,885,1,"The owners of this place are crooks. They recently reproÂ’d our truck after we were half-way paid off. They looked for any and every reason to repo it for months and would take it for whatever reasons (missed payments though we always gotÂ caught up or close) then make us pay a lump sum to get it back. UNTIL they'd made over half on it, in which point they took the truck to sell it to some other poor sap. The truck has several things wrong with it, that happened almost immediately after we got it but we're not the type of people to complain so we didn't bother.

These cards were mailed separately (within two to three weeks of eachÂ other). When attempting to use the second reward card which was mailed to myÂ home, the cashier stated it could not be used as it was previously obtained.Â Completely confused since I had the card in my possession how was it possibleÂ that I used it? The cashier had no idea how to handle the situation and askedÂ assistance from the manager who looked like she couldnÂ’t be bothered.Â SheÂ rudely told me I had to call customer service, which already in the store,Â wasting over a half hour of my time, I told her No, you can call. TheÂ individual on the phone, Lauren, was absolutely ridiculous. She explained that sometimesÂ duplicate rewards are issued and Unfortunately the amount could not beÂ obtained over and over again. Please tell me how this makes sense? Why would aÂ company send out multiple reward cards if it can only be used once? If you sendÂ me two cards, I am going to use those two cards. The reward amount was a lousyÂ $26 dollars, but why not use it if you have it. Lauren was no help andÂ supposedly the manager Katie was on her lunch break. I asked if there was anyÂ other manager and she said No. It seems really impossible that a largeÂ business as Sports Authority only has one manager in office. When calling laterÂ that day, I was told by another representative (Sean) that the manager had leftÂ for the day. Seems to me there is no manager and they are basically giving youÂ the run around in hopes of you giving up. I have emailed my concern to manyÂ email addresses found online and have received no response. It is extremelyÂ frustrating after spending hundreds of dollars on an elliptical and bicycle, toÂ which they pretend to have a reward system that you are unable to obtain. IÂ would have rather received no reward card, which would have saved my sanityÂ and time wasted at the store and on the telephone with their customer service. Bottom line: I will never shop in Sports Authority again and I hope that you do not either. This place is overpriced with employees who are poorly trained with upper management which cannot make decisions.

No voucher offered, no hotel compensation, no apologies, no explanation at all, except to rebook our flight for the next day. Frontier had one person to try and respond to over 100 people with no supervisors to assist. This did not only happen to my flight, but was happening to the majority of Frontier Airlines flights in my terminal. The terminal started off with a few people and ended up with a terminal (overflow) of irate passengers. I was told I cannot get reimburse for my hotel stay after Frontier cancelled my flight.

I was traveling abroad when my daughter called me to say that she could not reach anyone at the number to book her ride and that the number had been disconnected.Â  When she looked up the other name on the certificate as 1-800-skyride she found all this information about what a scam it was and all the testimony from people who could not get refunds when they were unable to reach the customer service line. I was so embarrassed and angry - the certificates had cost me over $400 dollars and left me looking like a fool in the eyes of my daughter.Â  I want my money back.Â  To this day I am hoping to find a way to reverse payment on this charge, join a class action suit or somehow get restoration for this fraud.Â  It does help to know that others have similar stories but it's cold comfort.Â  The realization that I may never recover this money still makes me feel sick.Â  I will never purchase anything by phone from an internet source again, that's for sure, but I can't believe this company has not been prosecuted.Â ",3802,889,890,1,"I would highly not recommend doing business with Galactic Snow Sports.Â  I ordered a pair of ski boots in early April online.Â  They were to small so I wanted to return them.Â  Tried many times to contact them.

Â Every time it was time to change the oil, we where there getting it changed. Â We only missed ONE due to the service department under construction. We purchased the extended warranty 100k miles or 4 years I believe. At about 96k miles the motor throws a rod. Â Mind you, we NEVER missed an oil change. When they where closed I changed it myself.

Now, because SOME CHEAP BUTT at Sports City wanted to save money, apparently the last motor swap, they replaced with a motor that had 60 k miles already and was also told that there was no 1 year warranty like I was told. Â Instead it was an EOT warranty (End of Term). Basically end of original extended warranty. Â Why earth would you warranty a motor for only 6 thousand miles?? Â Ok back on topic. After a lot of sleep less nights and fighting back and forth, my wife and I where told we are just SOL. Nothing they can Do.

I bought 2 tickets round trip for myself and my spouse. I went directly through the airlines website. I purchased the tickets along with upgraded package to allow baggage. Flight out to Colorado no problems. Coming home 9/28 our flight was scheduled to leave at 7:10 am... We boarded on time but then were asked to deplane a while later. They told us there was an electrical issue... The flight was then delayed 5 1/2 hours...which we were supposed to have a connection in Chicago and then on to Jax.
We were told when deplaning in Chicago that they were not sure if we were going to be on the same plane due to the fact that it was the exact same plane that was down because of earlier electrical issues. We went to restroom and when we came out accidentally turned the wrong way and had to go through security again... (The terminal we were in only had 1 gate) Was told earlier this was an old non used section of the airport...not sure why but who knows... Ok no prob. We went through to security.
Then the TSA agent told us we needed a gate pass due to the airlines not putting Chicago to Jax on our tickets??? So we sprinted to desk. They printed and security let us right up front. This total transaction was literally 10 mins. When we got back to the gate there was no one at the desk but plane was there. We tried to find someone but no luck. Remember this was a 1 gate terminal. Finally after another 10 mins an agent came off the plane... And then she refused to let us on...she stated she has already had to work 5 and a half hours over her shift ends...same time as flight delay. We explain we have our carry one on board with wallet included. She stated it was not her problem. And got her stuff and left.
We waited at the gate another 20-30 mins in hopes someone would come by. The plane was still there the entire time. Finally we went to ticketing and they said there was nothing they could do. Why didn't they call desk agent in the beginning to let them know we had to get gate passes is beyond me. Long story short they told us the best they could do is get us on a flight 2 days later... what!!! Then how are we going to get our carry ons back. After having to pay out of pocket for new tickets and having to have the bank help us with temp. CC... the only luck we had was our IDs were in our pocket. They promised refund.

I left over 6 messages because no one ever answered the numbers they provided in the paperwork. It was such a hassle to get them to replace the pans, even though that was one of the big selling points ""no questions asked, we will send you a new pan!"" Ya, they didn't tell you that you would have to pay the $40 shipping every time and that it would take over 2 weeks for them to send you the return label with the address and then it took over a month to get the new pans in.

I've even had friends come over and do the true medium test and these pans are awful. If they don't take over 30 minutes to warm up, then they burn everything that you cook in them! No matter how much oil and/or water you use, even though that was another big selling point, ""you can use little to no oil or water"". Worse than the pans tough, is the customer service from NutriChef, New Era, and Equitable Financing. You can never get a hold of anyone at NutriChef, always get an answering machine, and they will call back 2 weeks later.
New Era is pretty reasonable to talk to, but can't tell the same story twice.

WeÂ’ve had it for six months now and our overall experience with it has been disappointing. For a $250 pan, we havenÂ’t been 100% satisfied with it. The quality that we saw at the show and the quality that the one we got has been demonstrating is not equal. We feel that we got hustled a little bit.
The pan is great in terms of cooking temperature since we donÂ’t need to turn the stove up as high. However, weÂ’ve been following all the directions in terms of how to clean it or what to do before using it, but it still got marks on it. It wasnÂ’t what we anticipated it to be. There were also the free gifts that were not from NutriChef, but they were given to them to give out to people. We had to send a check. We were going to get free things, but we didnÂ’t - we just got our money taken. It was $170 plus the $250 pan, but we didnÂ’t get our trip. It was a disappointing experience.",3830,919,920,1,"I like the pots, the pans and the different cooking styles displayed in the NutriChef cooking show. But it was more of a waste of time because the pots and holders are overly priced and the things that were promised weren't given. I was told that they were giving out some of the stuff I've been looking at, but I have to pay to see the offer. So I wasn't enticed by that.",3831,920,921,0,"My fiance heard about NutriChef through a bridal expo. It was required for us to come in to win a trip somewhere, so we went to one of the sessions and ended up buying a couple of pans. The look is really nice but theyÂ’re not really working the way I would like them to be. IÂ’ve tried cooking a couple of different things on them. I know they say that youÂ’re supposed to not have to use any type of spray or oil, but a couple of things that I cooked that I didnÂ’t think I would need to use a spray for have been sticking and it looks like the pan has now changed color and got these different spots. IÂ’m not really too happy with that right now.",3832,922,923,2,"My husband purchased tickets to an Astros game on Saturday, August 11, 2018, online, with this pitiful excuse for an honest company. We printed our tickets and attended the game on Sunday, August 12, 2018. Come Monday morning, I checked our credit card and lo and behold, we had been charged two (2) times, for two (2) tickets each. When I called the aforementioned pitiful excuse for an honest company, I was told that they showed where tickets had been purchased twice. One order was for Section 327, Row 2, seats 15 and 16, which is the order we received confirmation and printed our tickets. The second order (which we did not place, nor receive confirmation) was for Section 253, Row 3, Seats 19 and 20.
Obviously, I would love to know if those seats were used (resold), or sat empty for the game. Of course, SeatGeek can't do anything about this, and insist that we placed two (2) orders. We, of course, did not place the second order, and therefore received no confirmation of this phantom order. WE WILL NEVER USE THIS TICKET SERVICE AGAIN!

I bought them from a different ticket vendor that did not work out to begin with, and being in a rush and having used SeatGeek before I had no hesitation using this site. However, when I had purchased my tickets (two) and went to place them under the scanner, they were invalid and blinking red instead of green when scanned. I called SeatGeek and they sent a pdf of the tickets which still did not work under the scanner. Calling again I was put on and off hold for quite some time and was offered assistance without receiving much actual assistance. I wanted to get into the concert as my main priority but they were unable to help me find different tickets. I was told I would get my money back right away after filling out a long form. I was fine with this however with the other ticket company that I had issues with I was given my money back the minute I contacted them with my issue. I have filled out the form and I am still waiting to get my money back and I did not get to attend the concert. I will be deleting this app because although they were willing to help, the help was not great and if this is rarely supposed to happen, I would hope that when this issue does happen it could have be solved much faster than this and exceptions could be made to help me get into the concert. The thing about a concert is you spend the whole night getting ready and it takes more money to get to the concert than just the actual ticket so I lost more than the approximate $168 that I still do not have back. The gas money, parking, and other such expenses add up too, which also went to waste. I have never been the type to write a review but, as a broke college student who works hard, saves almost every penny, and splurges wisely (I still bought the cheapest tickets), I was extremely disappointed to have one of the only nights of summer I looked forward to, taken away.",3834,924,925,0,"I purchased tickets as a Christmas gift approximately 12/01/17 for an event 11/10/18; Michigan Wolverines at Rutgers Scarlet Knights at High point Stadium in Piscataway, New Jersey to be exact.

I was told these tickets cannot be refunded and that the tickets would be delivered to me via email on 11/03/18 which is seven days before the event.

In all fairness, their FAQ section states that refunds may not be possible. What I don't understand is that SeatGeek claims to be the seller when you purchase the tickets but when I contacted their customer service I was told that the ticket was sold by a ""Fellow fan that used SeatGeek Marketplace""! They claim to be transparent but why hide who the actual seller is? When you are in a marketplace website such as eBay, Amazon or Etsy, you clearly know who the seller is.

We are headed cross-country for a big birthday celebration and wanted tickets to a Tony-winning show. The Ticketmaster service fees were almost the price of the tickets, so I looked for alternatives and read up on SeatGeek.
I bought two tickets, had a reasonable service charge assessed ($25 for two tickets instead of more than $150 for two via Ticketmaster). I got a screen response with a confirmation code, kept that window open and began watching my email for the ticket confirmation to arrive. After more than an hour, I decided to take a screenshot of what had popped up on the SeatGeek site, saved the file and went to bed.
I checked and my credit card has a pending charge for the related amount. Still no email. We're now more than 12 hours later. I've been asked by SeatGeek to review them and did. They sent a follow up, asking why the low review. I wrote back and explained. No reply. I finally emailed them and asked about why I was charged for tickets, got a confirmation number for tickets, but still had no email with info about the tickets. At that point, I learned that they are only a broker and don't actually have the tickets. So, they referred me to their vendor -- Telecharge. So, I had to phone Telecharge, give them my confirmation number, address, phone number, email, etc. And, now they say they'll send me the email confirmation in another 3 hours.
If I order from Amazon and they subrogate my order, they (Amazon) makes it right. I don't have to track down another vendor. I told this to SeatGeek and they said they would try to move that direction and would share my insights. Bull! They have been in business for 8 or more years and still don't have this figured out?

Unless we had reviewed the contract carefully we would have completely missed it. We had insisted we did not want this even before he printed the contracts out and he argued with us stating we MUST sign the contract with the $6000 on it stating that when we picked up the unit it would be taken off.
I was not born yesterday! This is dishonesty at its worst and Winnebago should be ashamed to associate its long standing and excellent brand with such a dishonest company like La Mesa. I understand their volume with Winnebago and the revenue that you generate from La Mesa in general. After I told them I would walk from the deal if he didnÂ’t reprint the contract WITHOUT the $6K he reluctantly reprinted it and his demeanor became combative and nasty. FAR from customer friendly.
BUT it doesnÂ’t stop there. We left a deposit of $500 with them and was given a receipt for it. When we went to pick up the coach and met a different finance person in Sanford and after we had signed all papers, we had to ask about the $500 deposit. It was nowhere on any of the final signed paperwork. After discussion the finance person again reluctantly put a check request in and and gave us a copy of it and said we would have our deposit returned within a week. We are now starting the 3rd week and no check.

SERIOUSLY! Their advertised ""down payments"" on Craig's List are not real! Once you get in there they take you to a side office and a guy says he wants to know what the salesman told me cause ""they"" the salesmen ""do not always tell the customers right"". (WHAT?) He then told me the ""down payment"" is followed by another $500.00 in 30 days and then another $500.00 30 days after that. Then the actual monthly payments will start after the additional $1000.00 are paid on top of the ""down payment"" being advertised. WAIT... IT GETS BETTER! (OR WORSE!) I paid half the advertised ""down payment"" cause the vehicle (a Ford Explorer) would not start when I attempted to test drive it. They jumped it and then the Explorer died as the salesman and I pulled out of the parking lot. I asked them to fix what was wrong with it and I would come back with the other half of the ""down payment"" once they notify me the vehicle was repaired. When I came back the vehicle was still not fixed! Also, they pulled out the paperwork and left the room with me alone with a stack of papers requiring my signature. I then realized what the man told me about the ""down payment"" plus the two additional $500.00 payments was a lie cause the paperwork to reflect additional payments double what he said. Also, they originally told me there was a 90 day/3000-mile warranty on the vehicle, but they wanted me to sign an ""As Is"" contract and agree that there was no warranty ""in writing"". When I asked the salesman (Chris Loynaz) about the differences reflected in the papers compared to the ""second"" story I was told by the other man, he (Chris Loynaz) got the other man to come into the room. When I questioned him why everything was not what he or the salesman (Chris Loynaz) originally told me, he said the ""extra"" money was the sales tax - even though the sales tax was already reflected in the paperwork. When I questioned him about that he got irritated and walked out of the room. I had to demand my money back... and they then made me sit around for about 30 minutes until the salesman (Chris Loynaz) came back in and handed me back my money and he then walked away.

I called customer service who switched me and put me on hold for 15 min. When I finally got someone, it took them 3 more hours and several tries before I finally could go online.

I called the Bill/Inquiry Customer Services Department, and a rep transferred me to another department. I spoke to the customer service representative and his Supervisor, and they both informed me that they were unable to remove the charges. Their reason was because there was no record in the system of my cancellation; therefore, they are unable to do anything for me. I told them that I spoke to a Verizon's Customer Service Representative, and that my account should have been canceled. I shouldn't be charged for a service that I have already canceled a month ago. After speaking to them, I realized that it was not going any way, and that I needed to speak to their manager instead. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to at that time but I will later on. It is not my responsibility that the company hired an incompetent customer service representative who is unable to do what was requested of her.

I should have refused delivery, but I thought he was trustworthy and saido When I took it to Ford they said the main wiring harness was damaged and a wire had been cut. This caused a sensor to not read properly and made the check engine light come on. I called Jason and he said bring it in. When I took in, He looked at it, denied they had anything to do with the damage. He had his shop foreman look at it and he agreed. They then assured me that they would take care of the issue. He told me he was going to talk to the insurance co. and would call me back that afternoon. He has NEVER called me back or responded in any way.

I ordered a chicken burrito, and halfway through my meal, I bit into what turned out to be a little clump of hair.
I am not the type of customer that wants to makeÂ a big deal over things that I understand can happen in the workplace, especially in the food industry, which I have been a part of for many years. I mentioned there was hair in my burrito and the workers offered to make me another one. I declined because at that point I was not really in the mood for a burrito anymore.
I can say that I am I particularly regular customer at your restaurant, and I have never had any problems with your food, other than this incident. While I am relatively certain that this was possibly a fluke, I am still concerned how this clump of hair got into one of the items I had asked to be put into my burrito. I am curious of how this could have happened.
I am also concerned with the lack of concern I received from the staff. I believe that just offering the same replacement menu item after something like this happens is not very acceptable. At that point, I would like to have been given a gift card or voucher so that the next time I came into our restaurant, I would have a free meal and better experience. Most customers, including myself are not interested in eating something that was just impaired.
I did not make any more fuss about the burrito, and just said that I did not want something else instead. I have other friends that are also regular customers at your establishment have the same issues every once in a while. I thought I would make it known that we enjoy your food, and would like to bring our business back, knowing that this issue will hopefully be addressed.

Send STOP to end, send HELP for help."" message!!!
WHAT? I just entered my code and it's not valid and / or been used, WTF?
Needless to say I've contacted TB numerous times and all I keep getting in return is how my code is randomly chosen that every 10 minutes for someone to win the PS4.

They waitresses took our drink order and got us incorrect drinks. After that they took our food orders and wrote my order down wrong. Instead of fixing it (I ordered the unlimited pasta) they showed me what she wrote down. I left it alone.

1. I asked for a quite location, I was seated at a table in the center of the restaurant that became progressively louder.
2. The bathroom was disheveled, toilet seat detaching.
3. No posted wifi password and because the room was so loud, could not accurately hear the staff I asked for it.
4. No place to secure my bicycle, I had to use unoccupied outside benches.
5. I was not asked if I was an club member.
6. Low menu diversity and unsatisfying menu options, and customizing what I wanted was going to cost more than I wanted to pay.
7. Low flavor meal, the water had more taste than the sandwich, all I could detect was the American cheese. The bread looked nice.
8. Plugged shakers, the pepper was coarser than the openings in the top, I had to unscrew the top to be able to add it to my meal.
9. Scant and paltry sides and add-ins. for $1 extra I got tablespoon of mushrooms added to the sanwich, the onions and mushrooms were only sufficient to be symbolic. I think there was meat in the sandwich. The hash-browns were as thin as a veneer, barely browned and smaller than the the bread.
10. The onion rings were low flavor, under cooked and had a pasty texture and flour flavor. I ate only one.
11. waitress did not ask me about the onion rings when she cleared the table.

We booked our flights for a trip in January 2019. We arrived at the airport to get a call from customer service saying that they didn't confirm our flights and we had no flight booked! We were heading to the Philippines from Canada and had a 24 hr layover in Singapore which we plannedÂ to stay the night at a hotel.
This messed up our plans as we had a strict timeline to follow while in the Philippines travelling to other islands (other flights booked to catch).
We spent about 8 hrs on the phone as they kept putting us on hold (20-40 minutes at a time) and transferring us to a supervisor one after the other, all requesting for the same information. 7 hrs on the phone with them meant they didn't rebook us a flight for the same day.
We ended up taking a chance and rebooking with Flighthub to be able to leave on the same day (midnight by then). After another 2 hrs on the phone with them on top of the 7, they finally agreed to refund us our money and gave us $100 credit.
They also suggested we stay in Singapore on stand by eventhough the China eastern flight agent at the airport was explaining to them that we would need the connection flight information or else we will be deported back to Canada. The Cheapoair customer service agent insisted for us to not listen to them and still go on stand by saying they didn't know what they were talking about. Cheapoair customer service agents are willing to tell you anything.
We said we would never book with Cheapoair again but we might as well use the $100 credit, so here I am currently on the phone with them because of course this credit is only redeemable through the phone and it's been 1hr and 11 minutes. And of course I have been transtered 3 times now to a ""supervisor"" that needs to approve this credit. They are making this extremely difficult for us to redeem the compensation for having not even confirming our flights in January leaving us without a flight on a trip that we have been planning for months.
Basically their customer service tactic is to leave you waiting on the phone pissed off for long periods of time until THEY HOPE you (the customer) gets fed up with waiting. Cheapoair DOES NOT HAVE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

I received an email promising a $15 promo if I make a $30+ purchase. Fantastic because I could use a few things Santa forgot. After putting some things in my cart and proceeding to checkout, no promo. Reread the fine print. Purchase must be made on mobile app, check; purchase must be sold by and distributed from Amazon...oops. So back to the shopping cart, remove that, add this, check and check. Proceed but no promo. Hunt for code in fine print but nothing. Search a bit online was no help. *sigh* customer service time. I initiated a chat and things were looking good. Rep said she needed a copy of the email AMAZON sent me...um ok so I forwarded it. Rep confirmed the promo should have applied and went to talk to her Lead. Came back and asked if the order was placed on the app. I would think they could tell but I confirmed anyway. Back to Lead. Asked if products were sold and distributed by Amazon. Again, this is AMAZON'S app so they would know better than I would but I confirmed. Back to Lead. Offered a $5 courtesy promo rather than fix the problem. My response was to request my Prime membership be cancelled. Rather than attempting to keep my business and make the customer happy, she cheerfully cancelled my membership.
So no $30+ purchase, no $119 membership and future purchases, one very grumpy customer all to save the $10 ($15-5) they had offered me in the email.

Many sites offer a ""ad based"" or ""pay to experience no ads"" type of subscription and crunchyroll claims to be one of them.
However, you will soon find that ads are used not occasionally,Â but incessantly... to force you to subscribe or go insane.
In fact, many of the ads are shown 4 or 5 times in a row. In the case of final fantasy... I just saw EIGHT ads in a row. This not only resulted in an unusually long (and boring!) delay for me, but actually a false charge to the folks who paid for the ad. They may believe the ad is being played to 8 different people when ... instead I saw the SAME ad eight times!!!
The ads only serve one purpose here: to get you to think that if you don't pay for the premium service (that they bait you into accepting even during their registration process!), or suffer the ad bombardment.
I actually almost completed the paid for service once I started going through the crunchyroll.com site because it came up so fast and covered so much of the registration page that _I thought it was the registration for the crunchyroll site_.
I tried coming in through the web site instead of the App and I found even more problems.
The show I had been watching was not listed.
There was no obvious search bar although I found it eventually. This lets them easily force you to watch what they are supposed to promote.

Not only did she have no clue about the printing nor design process of Spot UV while pretending she did, she started giving me attitude in the end by saying, ""this is why you should have shown me your designs first"" when I was only looking to get answers before finalizing my files. In the end, her solution was for me to spend extra money on design help when I didn't need any.
I spoke to a second ""specialist"" via phone the next day, hoping to get a more direct answer from someone with actual knowledge on the topic of printing. At this point, I should have gone with another print company already. He had no clue either. I showed him a mock-up of what I want as my final product and he didn't even know what a mock-up was, assuming it was the print file itself saying, ""your design is crooked.""

After reading other online reviews (after the fact) about this company, other people feel the same way I do. I purchased a logo from them, luckily at sale price. I was so excited and things were going great and customer service started out great but Wham! Things quickly went down hill, everybody stopped respondingÂ to my emails, even the owner, and it was taking forever for tech support to try and fix the issue with my logo files. Which by the way, never was fixed, evidently it's beyond their scope. And they didn't bother to give me updates. I got took, lesson learned and I'm moving on. Just want to warn everybody else.
The issue: a symbol image in my logo would not show up or download with some of my logo files and they never could fix it. In the process they messed up other versions of my logo files. LOL! The whole situation has been going on for over a week and it's been very disappointing and laughable too. Plus, they did not allow me to download the fonts that I used in my logo, only similar versions.
I sent the following farewell email to the Owner and the staff:
""Hello all.
Just wanted to say that LogoJoy quickly turned into LogoDisappointment. You all started out great, responsive and helpful but then went all the way down hill. But hey, seems like no one there cares, even the owner. Take their money and forget about them and don't complete their purchase. So, I no longer care and I'll write off my messed up purchase as a Huge Mistake and Rip Off. Lesson learned and glad I had only paid the sale price.

All the logo idea was mine from start to finish. While working on this, they charged my credit card $280 without my authorization and when I told them I placed a fraud claim with my bank they quickly replied they will reimburse and to please inform my bank to close out the investigation. After this my trust continued to go down the hill so at this point I decided to contact USPTO to do the copyrights/trademark registration instead of working that portion with them (Octa Logo / OctaGroup), however at the end when I got my final product they wanted to charge me $300 for copyrights services and threaten me saying they will open a legal case against me ignoring the logo was all my idea and not theirs. Do not trust this company. They will take your idea/design and make it theirs to then try to charge you and make money out of it. Sometimes if something looks to good or too cheap, is for something bad, is a scam and is not legit.

I ran across ""DesignProficient"", which I now understand is also grouped with OctaLogo, Logo Scientist, Octavideo and who knows what else.

I told him he sounded like heÂ was from India or Pakistan and he acted offended and said he hated that place (India) and hated the people. Then when I said Pakistan he asked had I ever heard of anyone named James Black from Pakistan. I told him I didn't think that was his name anyway because it was American. He then spun a yarn that he was from Paris and so was his mother but his father was American. He then began what was a campaign to try and convince me to allow them to create a website for me. He just wouldn't let up. I told him I had to talk it over with my husband and I would want him to speak to my husband. We set up an appointment to conference call and after the call was over my husband said it was a scam. He had asked James for a SOW (statement of work) outlining milestones and costs and he sends me this poor excuse for an invoice. Then he kept asking me how many years I wanted to apply for the copyright for my logo. Well I didn't need a copyright it was a trademark. When he wasn't getting me to move on that or the website I didn't hear from him for a day, so my husband said i wasn't going to get the logo I paid for. I came up with a scam to scam the scammers. I wrote him and told him my husband wouldn't invest because he didn't think they were legitimate after reading some negative reviews. I said I had read them too but I know you can't please all the people all the time and that I had taken money out of my 401K but he was starting to make me nervous because I had received nothing from them to make me trust them. I immediately heard from him the next day and he did give me all the files for my logo. I then told him while I really liked him I had an offer from someone else to do a website for me for a 1/3 of his cost. Well he has given me three additional discounts since down. We are now down to 899.00 from 3,250.00. Yeah Right. I had also told him I needed to see verifiable websites his company had done the work on. He gave me a list of about 6 and the very first one on the list belongs to Sherrod Egypt a TV personality and real estate agent. I called her today and was told the name of the company who designed her website and it wasn't DesignProficient or OctaLogo or Logoscientist. The company is called ""The Design People) Agent Image and they work almost exclusively on real estate agents websites. I spoke to Gregg who is the vice president and he asked me to send him the emails I had received from James. I am just so glad that I didn't fork over the $3250.00 or even a portion of it.

There really should be a ""zero stars"" ratings on these review sites, because that is what MyGiftCardSupply would get.
It really bothers me that they have my picture IDs. I've been shopping online fore years and have never (before) been asked for those when making purchases or opening accounts. I major concern is identity theft, of course. Maybe selling IDs is how they make their real money!
How could they have possibly gotten the 5-star rating that they show on their site? Almost 23K ""certified reviews"". HA! It's hard to believe they've sold that many gift cards, much less have that many perfectly satisfied customers. Stolen identities, maybe.
I was looking at their ""Meet Our Team"" page. It doesn't say where the founder (Sam) and the systems tech (Naveed) are from, but they're more than willing to share that the other three live in Chile and Bangladesh. (Doesn't that give you a feeling they support world peace!?!) I don't trust that the photos of ""them"" are real. Maybe they are photos of real people whose identities they've stolen... people who once tried to buy gift cards from them & had to upload photo IDs.

2. The delivery information page states that I have free UPS 2nd Day Air shipping if the value of my order after discounts is above $100. I assembled my order, but the free UPS 2nd Day Air shipping was not available. I contacted support and sent them two emails and they replied, saying that the $100 number is an error and I'm eligible for free UPS 2nd Day Air shipping only if my order is above $120. He also stated that it always has been so. In the email he quoted the delivery page and even there in his email it was $100, right below his statement about $120. I had to remove from the cart $17 worth of goods and pay for UPS 2nd Day Air shipping instead.
3. I tried to pay with my debit card. It didn't work because of some mismatch. I decided to pay with crypto instead. Later, I received an SMS that my bank account was charged. I contacted support immediately and after some questions and answers he said that in their system the transaction appears declined. He also said that it might be an authorization, so I was patient. Four days later nothing changed, since the transaction was complete, so I contacted the support again and after a delay they shortly told me to contact my bank. I did and thankfully, after 10 days the transcation was refunded by my bank.
4. The payment page says that if I pay with crypto, I can save 15% by using the code ""BITCOIN"". I tried both the codes ""CRYPTO"" and ""BITCOIN"" and neither worked. The payment processor Coingate.com didn't ask for any code at any step of the process. Just an hour ago I tried the code again and it definitely doesn't work.
In this case, not the problems, but the supports reaction completely changed my opinion about Liftmode. A customer is a fool: does it matter that our website clearly says it's $100 and even the email we just sent clearly says it's $100, if right above we can say that ""no, it's actually $120 and has always been so?"" The reaction about the card payment problem is equally bad. I sent you my banking statement where you can see that my account is charged, I waited and contacted you again four days later. Couldn't you contact your payment processor and ask to check the transaction? You easily could, I couldn't. Their reply seems to mean ""not our problem"".

I tried a few sessions and found them to be pep talk groups to cheer you on for little ""wins"". I didn't learn much from them and found I knew even less about the program. I stayed for another orientation explanation but found it to be about as helpful as the first. I think I gave this program 2.5 months and decided not to continue.
The app it self is confusing. You still need to pay for a monthly fee even though you're a Weight Watchers member attending meetings. The app is geared towards their product, does not clearly state proportion servings and really only good if you use their Weight Watchers products. Otherwise you're better off using a calorie counter app.
I occasionally have blood sugar drops. I found the app does not calculate for health issues. Each time I had a one of these I ended up eating a mini meal and the app would calculate for that. By the end of the week I had zero points left for food because of the extra food my body needed to survive. I tried to supplement these variances with the zero point foods but found my body quickly gained weight. I gained a lot of weight trying to use this program. I spent the next two years properly dieting and teaching my self to stop eating when full. Teaching your self to stop eating when full is really the only diet coach you need.
I did not find Weight Watchers to be all that helpful. I ended up gaining little knowledge about the program and ended up gaining a bunch of weight. I spent the next two years teaching my self to eat right and to stop eating when full. No I would not recommend Weight Watchers. It is not for everyone. Their diet sure didn't work for me.",41144,1282,1283,0,I ordered Red Tea Detox in July. Upon opening it I found it was not what I had expected and immediately asked for a refund. That was in July.

If you do the math, 3.07 x 52 weeks in a year is $159.64. You divide that by 12 months and your monthly bill should be $13.30. Right? Sorry, WRONG. They charged meÂ $16.21 per month. I called them and the lady told me that the small letters supposedly said something different. So with Weight Watchers you don't sign for what you see in big colorful pricing information, you actually commit to pay something completely different that is probably explained in very small letters in a place that as a customer you don't have access to anymore.
I requested to cancel the account and the lady had the nerve to even try to force me to take 1 month free instead, and since I said no then he kept insisting with two and three months free. So they lied to you, they take away your money and then they try to make you stay.
What a company. Stay away.",41146,1284,1285,1,"I signed up to weight watchers and paid upfront for 3 months, however I didn't really use it properly and was going to sign up again when I could afford it and give it another go. This month I logged into my bank to find that WW had taken Â£12.95 from my account and because of that I went into myÂ overdraft and was charged by my bank. Furious I went onto the WW site to see in SMALL print that you will continue to be charged until you inform them of your cancellation. I am fed up of companies locking people in to contracts, it's not the way to do business! I emailed them asking for my money back and my bank charge to which they refused saying that it was in their terms and conditions.

I was not offered a refund for anything. It was clear they only want compliments. This is a total scam.
The majority of the 2 hours was used as a sales pitch to buy vitamins he only had ""a few"" left of. The sales pitch lasted 45 minutes. The actual ""hypnosis"" was not hypnosis. It was a relaxation exercise where he told us smoking is bad for us, pronounced ""painful"" in an odd way, and put in some brief aversion therapy by telling us to imagine licking an ashtray if we ever smoked again. The ""hypnosis"" lasted, he claimed 29 minutes, my phone said it was 35 minutes. He asked leading questions to get the attendees to agree they were ""hypnotized"" for only 10 minutes or so as ""proof"" they were hypnotized.
We also had a 15 minute break to smoke and to buy vitamins. And the seminar started at 2:15 to give the people that were late a chance to get there (no one got there after 1:50). Also, Pat is a fast talking man from NJ, he barely slowed down during the ""hypnosis"" and we weren't allowed to ask questions because he's answer them eventually.

2- its a digital product, but you have to provide a shipping address evenÂ if you want to check out through paypal.
3- the 2 youtube review videos could easily be affiliated with the company. How would one random customer have a special link for a $20 discount?
4- her story in the hour and a half long video is really far-fetched about her being bit by a snake and falling in quicksand to get this recipe from an ancient African shaman. Plus, why keep selling your product for a solid hour and a half. It said at the beginning she would give you the recipe at the end of the video. Of course that was a lie. Even during the video there is a countdown on the screen to when you get the recipe and it counts down to zero, disappears, and she keeps talking and never gives you the ingredients.
5- her story also says she tried everything else to loose weight including eating less and exercising alot. However, the video also said she had a soda addiction and a sweet tooth. Seems like there might have been more options left before risking your life in Africa.

To me they were Clearly unsympathetic and lacked empathy to my concern and issues. They didn't even discuss that they would look into my issues and get back to me.
However, they were sure to tell me that I would have to pay the $125. They did this by way of charging my original credit card information from my first order when I signed up two weeks ago. In other words, they kept my credit card information and then, as soon as I got off the phone with them, they immediately charged my credit card account $125 even after all of the issues I raised and, stating I did not want to pay this cancellation charge of $125.

Knowing that what she had said so far was false --I just hung up...Remarkably, Keen would not even let me leave feedback.

I thanked her for her review but advised that I could not afford her $80 Fee which is more than R800 for me.

FRAUDS!!!!!!",41202,1349,1350,2,"So I've never ever wrote a review about something or a company but I am extremely upset and have never had such absurd service from a company. I registered with babies r us and target. Target was great! But babies r us was literally unhealthy for me. I had 2 items I wanted to purchase on my own from myÂ Registry after receiving my completion coupon which was the crib mattress and the bedding set. I received my completion coupon by mail and by email and I log on to purchase my items. As I'm ready to check out my coupon code turns out invalid... so I call costumer service. I had to be on the phone for 2 hours !!!! 2 hours .... with this lady who I believe had no idea on how to help me but I remained patient. She then tells me ""can you hold a second"" and I said ""okay..."" and she hangs up on me. So I'm furious!! She had my email, she had my phone number so I waited a couple of days to see if she would call me back or I would receive my problem fixed by email and nothing. So I call costumer service again... and I ask to speak to a supervisor and the supervisor refuses to take my call. I'm holding for 40 minutes as the employee is trying to help me and transfer the call to ""higher power"" and finally a supervisor decided to take my call. She doesn't take the fact that I had to spend now 2hrs and 40 mins on the phone to get my code as a matter and just moves on to getting my order done. She places the order for me and I'm thinking maybe after she will at least apologize for everything I've had to go trough just to place an order with them. But no... she places my order and then tells me the only available store for the items to be dropped off are in Roseville, and I'm like wait... what?? I thought the items would be delivered to me? She said no ... that the order would be arriving at this store.
At this point I didn't care to go pick it up at a store. Whatever ... I didn't even think to check to see how far away Roseville was. I mean it just had to be the nearest store to me right ? I check to see after I Hangup and Roseville store is 3 hours away from me !!!!!!
I was livid.
I didn't even wanna have to deal with costumer service for another 2 hours plus I really liked the bedding set so I decided I'd just go pick up my order and about a week later I have the time to go and pick up my items, I'm really upset but it's whatever now I'm just going to pick up my items and never do business with them again right? ...
so i get to the store with my barcodes for the items I purchased for pick up and the girl is having a hard time finding them. I show them the email confirming that my items had arrived there and she calls her supervisor. The supervisor then tells me that my order had been canceled.
Im 37 weeks pregnant.. I literally was about to have a melt down. I felt my tummy get so hard and a stabbing pain at how angry I was that I was just about to start crying there but I'm trying to hold myself together and try to explain everything I've gone through and now this. I never got an email or nothing saying my items were cancelled. So they go to the back trying to see if the items I ordered were still available and no one had purchased them after 20 mins ..they find them in the back. So then the supervisor tells me that I had been refunded for the bedding but not the mattress so I would have to repay for it. So I pay .... i get my items and try to move on with my day. I call my mom to vent to her about my experience with babies r us and she said ""please check your account ... make sure they didn't try stealing your money"" so I laughed like that would really just over do things so I go look at my bank account and I had 2 transactions back to back within a minute... one for $120 (the bedding) which I paid at the store right? And then I had a second transaction right after that one for $297 from babiesrus.com.
but why??
I call the store and they tell me i need to contact costumer service (great!) Im on the phone for 30 minutes and the girl tells me that I should of never been charged at the store in the 1st place ...
and she's trying to transfer my call to higher power. I'm on hold for 20 mins and she then tells me that someone will contact me about the issue, she gets my phone number and no one calls me back.
The stress and anger they've caused me is not healthy for me or my baby. This is my first child, I didn't expect to have to go through something like this just to get my babies items together. I wonder what hell im gonna be put through just to get my money back that they stole.

Once I got home IÂ saw the bottom of the box was scotch taped shut, the seat had markings all over it and literally smelled like crap.

So, card received and activated, and when I tried to place my order online just an hour ago, it would not accept the Application Key Code for the 15% off and gives me an error. This is THE MOST un-friendly website I have ever dealt with and I am extremely unhappy with this service. I have already missed the baby shower (it was on 8/5). My only alternative is to go direct to the store to make my purchases, and all I have to say is they had better accept the 15% credit coupon, and I had better receive the online pricing.

They take your money assumingÂ manufacturer will give them their items and then give them to you; in other words they take your money hold it for over a month and they dont even have a hold of what they are selling.

Ordered a Bugaboo product through this company. All but one part arrived. No biggie, as assumed they simply forgot to send or a shipping issue since the website account said all shipments complete. The chat rep, Jasmine said the remaining piece won't ship until 2 weeks laterÂ which I was very surprised by since the website may no reference about a delay and received no messages of delay and the website itself did and still does show order complete and everything shipped. She said it was in the order confirmation that it won't ship until 30th. She offered to ""resend"". I let her know I never recieved any message saying that date, and took screenshots of the actual emails I did get from the order date until now. She then sent me a confirmation from her own email account, still not acknowledging that I never received that. And yes, not in spam either.
So their system messed up and it didnt send out a certain order email. Once again, normally no biggie, as the company would simply apologize, but in this case not at all. And the email she sent also says to check the website for order status, and I kept repeating the order status on the website makes no reference to the 30th ship date, and says the order is complete. She continued to ignore that fact and instead kept repeating it would ship on the 30th.
I used her name, Jasmine and the person said this is Devin the company owner. Which was quite interesting since right above every message including that one it says, Jasmine. So once again seems to be another bug in the system or Devin simply sat down at Jasmines computer and started replying. Normally when an owner gets involved things go smoothly since this is their business and name on the line.
He immediately asked what I wasnt understanding? I started to write a reply, since as you can see above its not a matter of not understanding its a matter of never being told part of the order would be late and most importantly their site still shows order as complete. But right after he asked the question it showed he was writing more. I asked him to stop typing so I can answer the question. He replied Excuse me. and disconnected the chat.
Seriously feel like Im being punked. I thought perhaps Jasmine simply said she was the owner, as hard to imagine and owner ever acting like the above, but did a quick search and appears they have a D on BBB, and 19 out of 22 similar reviews about the customer support on site jabber and other sites. My mistake for not researching their past rating history.
I'm reaching out to Bugaboo now so hopefully they can address this immediately with this vendor as well as filing a formal BBB report assuming I do not hear an valid explanation such as a rogue employee? The products that did arrive look great to note, and one box was damaged significantly upon arrival, but the FedEx man pointed that out, and I checked and confirmed what was inside was not damaged. So the box getting damaged may have just been a shipping issue.
Im sure the late pieces will eventually arrive, so this is not a complaint on the products, rather the absolutely atrocious customer support and owner experience. Had an actual part arrived damaged I cant imagine what it would have been like getting that resolved with them so once again, cannot repeat enough that you should avoid this company at any and all costs. If the company reaches out with an apology or improves their practices I will be sure update this accordingly but based on the responses to other complaints that does not seem likely.
UPDATE-
Just to note, there are multiple false statements in the store response. Never was I offered an expedited shipping from the start of the conversation to the end they mentioned it wouldn't ship until November 30th. No other expedited date was ever mentioned. They ""literally"" did not answer all my information 6 times. They did not and still have not explained why the website says order is complete and all shipments are sent. I asked multiple times but no response other than them closing the chat. The last statement was ""excuse me?"" from the owner after I asked him to stop typing so I could reply to his question asking what I was confused about. I like I imagine most all of the other reviewers here and on BBB and other review sites would much rather be enjoying our product rather than having to spend time writing these reviews, but I feel a duty to share my experiences good or bad so that others know where to spend their dollars. The false statements in the stores reply is concerning and I noted that in a reply to the owner. Apologies go a long way, and I imagine would work better than blaming customers. Hopefully this can be a learning experience for the company to improve.",41221,1370,1371,1,"I had ordered dog food from 1outlet.

Even revealing details that should remain private about his family.
He confessed he had been 'stalking' me & many other exotic women (black hair, dark olive skin, dark eyes) everyday for months. His type- asian, middle-eastern, mediterannean, mixed race or black.
He will feed you a load of fantasy & lies about his life in order to gain trust & then progress onto sexting, phone calls & a one night stand or two. Perhaps even for a few months. Before he starts backing away two-timing you & ready to go onto the next victims. It must take some planning.
I learnt that this is what he does 24/7 everyday. He very quickly suggested we exchange phone numbers and started texting each other.
He sounded reasonably educated and said he worked in finance. Lo & behold he preys on both victimised women with problems as well as well groomed educated career types. The photo he uploaded with him standing around a couple of nice cars is far from the reality. A rusty old car sitting on bricks & a tiny old two-seater that regularly breaks down is the actual reality.
He is a sad looking balding sight, with a pockmarked hairy back resembling a crocodile's & talks about nothing else but his past conquests ex-wives, ex-girlfriends & horrible family. Btw the ex girlfriends also fill in as F-buddies, so beware.
His health problems sound like a publication in a health journal for grubby diseases. ED could just about, be excused if he had a monogamous bone in his body. He does not & has never practiced safe sex. Don't expose yourself girls to horrible stds. His mouth is not just for stringing out lies, it's been part of this dangerous man's tools for picking up disease from the immoral individuals like himself & passing it on & endangering the health of otherwise healthy unsuspecting women.
He is mentally ill, a penniless hoarding hermit living in a small village, South of UK, sorrounded by dust mites & mildew, living in one room in a dark dingy delapidated rented grimy dirty smelly house, with decaying food, filthy carpets covered in other women's hair, dirty underwear, dry skin particles & heaven knows what else. The stacks of dusty old newspapers are a sight to behold. He has nothing to offer anyone. He might try to fool you by mentioning how it would be nice to settle down get married & have children soon. Don't fall for it. It's nothing but a string of lies.
Just a warning girls. Don't fall for the attention & attempts to win your sympathy. You are simply one of many that he has on the loop.

The only people I got a smile from wereÂ either 70 if they were a day or really obese and one was emaciated. I take health serious and made that very clear.
I think eharmony is done and don't have anyone bothering to pay theses days. I sent smiles to every match for 3 weeks and got not one reply so I'm guessing they are all fake profiles. Not one reply after the same pics and info got overwhelming response on Tinder.Â Eharmony is almost all fake profiles now.
Oh and one was clearly a foreign scammer and begged me to contact his friend Harold who really liked me lol. I got an email saying he had been removed. The matches were often 200-300 miles away even though I said a 30 mile limit.
Honestly do not waste your money!
I asked for a refund on day 15 as I couldn't get through on the number and was told no. The best they could do was cancel the repeat subscription after the 6 months I've paid for and they will let me give my subscription to someone else. My friends just laughed and said no thanks.

First, you can't write anything about yourself. As soon as I wrote something and submitted it, it disappeared. It seems like most of the profiles have the same problem, as they're mostly blank. I contacted customerÂ service and they told me to email them what I wanted on my profile and they would post for me. What a hassle and what if they mess it up?
Secondly, I received a lot of messages, like ""Care to chat?"" or ""I want to get naughty with you."" I would respond and hear nothing back. I believe they were bots. They could have been real members, as there's an option to allow the site to send out a message you've composed and appear to browse profiles to help get interest in yours, but it doesn't seem like the women, if they're are real, are active on the site.
Finally, in order to delete your profile and discontinue your membership, you have to call customer service. They do their best to keep you on the site, offering 7 days free and a free upgrade, but it's a waste of time and money.

Prior to joining Cupids Coach, I personally researched several one-on-one match making services; five to be exact. In addition to researching companies online, I interviewed three in person and two by phone.
Julie Ferman, owner of Cupid's Coach was one of the services I've interviewed in person, She convinced me by her sales pitch and promise to introduceÂ me to well established men. She explained that Cupids Coach had a very good screening process for candidates and that men paid higher fees to sign up for the service.
My biggest concern, which I expressed to Julie, was ""inventory"". Was there really a large enough pool of men that have paid thousands of dollars to find love, and would be interested in a woman over fifty years old? Julie claimed that 'mature women' were her 'specialty'. Against my better judgment, I signed up for the service and paid a substantial, large amount of money.
After being a member of Cupids Coach for less than a month, I have learned real quickly that my concerns were very valid. I've started to question 'candidates'. As it turns out, many of them came from family members or friends of the owners or other dating sites. They never paid any money to the service. Of the few men I came across that had paid, at one time or another had been in the system for years. Further, by their own admission, they were surprised to hear from the service. Some of the candidates even admitted, that they were promised three free other dates if they would go out with a particular woman -- probably an older woman or one who was promised something that Cupids Coach is finding hard to deliver.
Most of the candidates were not up to the 'established standard' as Julie told me they would be. Many were struggling financially and were no where near where I am in my life. This, by the way, was one of my strong demands. Candidates had to be on the same level living standard than myself or better. Some of the gentlemen who did not pay for the service, were not into serious dating and even rude at times.
Julie and her co-worker threw anything my way that probably would agree to go out with me.
However there was no matching, no consideration!!! When I approached the service, I was handled as if I was a difficult candidate, asking too much for my age. Excuses and more sales pitches were given to make up for the lack of good, established clients on their part.
I'm writing this to warn anybody, who considers spending any money on this particular dating service. There is not a lot of information out there and frankly, the better business bureau takes to much time upon people to get anything achieved. Thank God for the information age, so with a little research, innocent hardworking men and women can be protected from such services.",41275,1428,1429,0,"I found this website after listening to another dating coach's recommendation. I read all the reviews in my location/area?; there were only 12 and two of them were written almost exactly alike, as if they were written by only one person,five years apart, however there were two different names for these reviews, one was Lowell B. and one was ToddW.!! This makes me suspicious enough to avoid this dating website and the fees quoted in some reviews were outrageous! Sounds like the owners are just preying on lonely people.",41276,1429,1430,1,"The site is a good idea in theory but the awful webmaster spoils it. He really doesn't care about the atmosphere on the site, or whether the site works properly.
He lets people get away with very unpleasant behaviour, and from what I've heard he speaks more harshly to the moderators, who are doing the best to keepÂ the site pleasant in sometimes difficult circumstances, than he does to the trolls!
Also the site is full of bugs that never get fixed. And the webmaster never replies to e-mails. And if the bugs don't prevent you from sending messages, you'll find that unfortunately most members have such bad mental health problems that they can't keep up a regular correspondence.
The chatroom is sometimes OK though.
Overall I'd say that the site probably isn't worth joining.",41277,1430,1431,1,"In theory the idea of this site is a good one. In reality you get a whole bunch of very dysfunctional people who are more mentally ill than they will admit to.

After only reading for 10 seconds the screen was interrupted with a notice stating that the site wanted me toÂ share location information to continue viewing. I made the mistake at taking them at their word, DON'T CLICK ON THE BUTTON ALLOWING THEM INFORMATION!!! Just leave the site, quickly!
I made the mistake of trusting clicking yes and from that point on began having annoying popups appear in the bottom right hand corner of my Firefox browser with no apparent way of removing them. MalwareBytes, nor Kaspersky could find any trace of what appeared to be malware installed. Finally, I figured out on my own what had happened, though not how to permanently reverse what evil they had done.
Apparently they use a combination of cookies to track your movements on the web that transmits this information back to one of their servers that pushes ads over top of the page you are viewing. The use of a push server makes trying to find them a bit of a chore, they have also added keys in the Windows registry so that deleting and reinstalling Firefox will do no good. The only way I found to stop this nonsense was to do the following ...
1. Go to the three bars just under the red exit button at the upper right of the Firefox browser. Select ""Options"", on the left side menu, go to ""Content"". The third category down will be ""Pop-ups"", click the ""Exceptions"" button and in the dialog box that appears, delete any and all site URLs that have ""tomshardware"" in them.
2. Download AdwCleaner from MalwareBytes and install. Don't trust any third party sites, just go and install it and run a scan. It will find the crap in the Windows registry and in your AppData folder where the lowlifes from Tom's installed keys to ""phone home"". Delete these (AdwCleaner will do this for you).
3. Now we've eliminated the Tom's push server from the equation, unfortunately for us though the scumbags at Tom's have opened the door for other push servers (including this site) to interrupt our enjoyment of the web. That is where AdBlocker Ultimate (free) comes in. It is available via the ""Add-ons"", accessible in the same menu I refer to in step 1 to get to the ""Options"" in Firefox. Be forewarned, there are several add-ons that purport to block ads, the most prominent being ""Ad Blocker"", which is nothing more that a trojan that actually allows certain ads to always get through. Thank God I looked at the number of users, user reviews and the stellar rating the software had before installing.
It appears the popups are dead for the time being. As for Tom's Hardware, not only was the information that I was looking for bogus (clickbate?), but in Googling a fix for this problem guess what URL appears in over 3/4 of the ""how to fix"" links ... Tom's Hardware. The most often seen response, ""Well you clicked on it!"" Way to go you pond scum.
UPDATE: A few added notes to fix your Firefox browser. Clear any and all cookies with ""ad"" in the name (or for that matter, any you don't immediately recognize), and of course the ""tomshardware"" cookie(s). Just don't delete the ones for sites you regularly log in to. I also found the door they kicked open in my browser and how to close it, courtesy of ""jscher2000"".

DailyKos saysÂ it doesn't remove posts, but it does worse - it gives ""trusted"" users complete power to flag and censor comments, and it takes just two such flags to remove your comment. This means that no deviation from what these users consider the ""correct"" one, even a ""friendly amendment,"" is allowed. As a result of this abdication of responsibility by the editors, a few narrow-minded ideologues are free to act as gatekeepers to stifle democratic discussion. I discovered this the hard way: like another person commenting here, I offered my firsts comment (polite, no unprofessional language, just calling for caution on the Russia question) and was promptly trashed and insulted by a string of childish nasty responses calling me a bot, a ""kamikazi drone strike,"" etc. Worse, the very first reply ""flagged"" my comment for deletion and it was then ""hidden"" along with the nasty replies so my point was effectively censored. As someone who is regularly trashed for being too ""liberal"" I found this astounding! All a reader has to do to remove a view s/he doesn't like is flag it? How convenient!

I am a New Yorker who visited Montreal with my GF for several days last week.

Â We were recommended to check out Â the Cold Room while in MTL. Â Honestly, I think my TLDR above kind of says it all. Â The staff were WONDERFUL (once we managed to get inside). Â I would say the real issue was the terrible music. Â One does not play BLUES or easy listening pop (I consider the Beatles easy listening pop) Â in a speakeasy. Â Well, I guess they do in MTL, but we found it a major turn off. The drinks were ok - kind of small but not bad tasting. Â We were not bowled over by the creativity of the cocktail menu. Â ... I'm sorry to sound like a carper but basically we felt that this place is highly overrated. Â Change the music, be a little more generous with the pours.. and get rid of the merch ..

I'm originally from Brooklyn, NY so I guess that means my standards are a lot higher for a place that specializes in making good cocktails.
The Dead Rabbit, Members Only, Angel's Share, Death & Co., etc. in NYC are all great, but this place was a huge let down.
The crowd that comes in here is pretty much what I would call ""bridge and tunnel"" people, which basically means a whole lot of American tourists that look like they are from New Jersey, Long Island, and Staten Island covet this place - just a bunch of basic humans.
The cocktails aren't even creative - nothing about these drinks are wow. Â They are pretty basic and there isn't any experimentation with the ingredients or flavors except for the Almond Milk Punch - exactly what I ordered. Â The cocktail list didn't encourage me to order anything else. Â So, I guess having us wait for 30 minutes to get in on a Friday night was fairly ridiculous when the drinks sucked.
All the hype, mediocre drinks, and ambiance reminds me of a very masculine steakhouse where you're able to order a steak well-done without receiving weird stares ... and if I might add, they play AWFUL music. Â This place tries to be ""hip"", but honestly, I don't see anything ""hip"" about it. Â Perhaps I'm spoiled by NYC.

A few minutes later someone took our order and we again waited 15 minutes as the waiter tended to other tables. After about 30 minutes being there without a drink, we lost our enthusiasm for the place and left. On the way out the waiter gave me some attitude and I simply explained to him how long we weren't given service. He told me that it's a busy bar and that I should have expected this. This seems like an isolated incident based on how good the reviews are.",51335,1493,1494,0,"It's pretty dark, their drinks looked interesting. After about 20 minutes we got our drinks only to find out that they are 90% juice and bitters, 10 actual liquor. For $10 a drink that's pretty disappointing. After an hour I had to track down the server and ask for the check, this is of course after he brings three rounds of shots to the group next to us, and closes out two other tables.

My husband had already had 3 glasses of wine at this point and we assumed he would comp us one glass of wine and my $4 limeade. We didn't get dinner for another 25 minutes and when the bill came (also late) he didn't comp a glass of wine or my limeade. We loved the ambiance and the menu.

Although we were a bit disappointed with the portion and all, we enjoyed the atmosphere. Unfortunately, at the end the waiter impolitely raised his voice about tipping (although we gave him tip, but he complained.) He has to know tipping is a privilege, not an obligation, and if someone is totally happy will give more tip. We were not totally satisfied with the service.

I'm not the type of person to complain and I've been there a lot and I'm used to noisy place, but this place is next level noisy.

If that wasn't bad enough, he stated he could remove the bug with a spoon and stated if I wanted another beer, I would have to pay for one. Shocked, I said sure I'll pay for another one. He then left the beer containing the bug sitting on our table for many minutes, and when he returned for with another beer, he once again asked if I wanted him to remove the bug with a spoon, to which I replied absolutely not. I asked another waiter if I could speak to the manager and he stated that my previous waiter was the manager. I then told him what occured and asked him if that is normal for them to offer to spoon bugs out of beer to which he nonchantly replied ""yes"". Absolutely disgusting.

Â Yes, the terrace is pretty, but the service is SO BAD.
First, they don't take debit or credit, which I know is the case in certain places but I think it's bad business. Â Second, you have to pay for your drinks as they come to the table, which to me ruins the experience of having a night out and chatting with friends - I don't want to deal with money AS the drinks come. Â Again, I know they're not the only place that does this but it really rubs me the wrong way. Â The waitress took forever to come serve us. I wasn't really in the mood for alcohol so I asked for a diet coke, and she said they don't have anything diet. Huh?!
Then, I ordered some chicken wings and it took over an hour, and then this guy comes up to the table and hands me a styrofoam container in a paper bag with a receipt stapled to it. I was confused but then he explained he was the delivery guy - they don't make the food on the menu, they order it out, and then the other restaurant comes and delivers it! So now I'm tipping another restaurant delivery man for food I ordered here? To be fair, it did say that on the menu on the cover (which I didn't see until much later), but who reads the cover of the menu??
I found the whole place to just be ridiculous. On top of that, the drinks are expensive. Never again.",51352,1513,1514,0,"The terrace is cool, but the service was terrible.
Waitress was curt (borderline rude). We asked what beers they had, she stared blankly and listed a few styles. We chose IPA, but who knows from where. The second beer I ordered, she just never brought.

This was the first place we went after driving in from Toronto (since we were staying at the lovely Angelica Blue B&B down the street) and we were worried this was how Montreal was going to treat our freedom-loving these-colors-don't-run boy-howdy American selves.

Neat spot, but get your act together.",51353,1514,1515,1,"Blond waitress denied me water in the patio area.

The bouncer/host talked down to us from the moment we walked in, but I tried to look past it. When we came in he told us there was standing room only, which was fine. It's a small space so it was pretty awkward, and we were waiting for a table to open up. The booths are big, public benches, and a nice couple who was sitting on the end of one got our attention and offered to move over so we could sit down, which we did. The same host came over shortly after and snapped ""You can't just come in here and shove people over."" I was shocked, having worked in a lot of restaurants, about being spoken to this way for absolutely no reason. We left right away, and as I was leaving I told him that I found what he said to be disrespectfully. He belligerently refused to acknowledge it, yelling things like ""How is that rude? Things like that happen 20 times a day. You're welcome to leave if you don't like it, it's not rude."" OK. Maybe this is just how they talk to people here, but I would recommend they hire someone who's not a sociopath to interact with customers. Definitely not going back.",51355,1516,1517,1,"I honestly have no idea how a place like this can get that many good reviews.
I sometimes wonder if the people here have any idea what a good cocktail is.
Because I can't believe we just got unlucky tonight.
I love cocktails. When I went back to Paris I was amazed to see a few amazing cocktails bars and I was so sad to leave, but in my mind I was hoping it would be ok, I would get good cocktails bars some place else. Well it's definitely not in Montreal that I'll have the chance to experience that again.
Because this one is supposed to be one of the best. And what do you get ?
A glass of ice with cinnamon flavoured water.
I seriously couldn't drink it. The ice glass came with three straws. I tried the three of them to hopefully get a taste of the cocktail and ... Nothing. I never thought I would ever have to suck so much on something.
Joke aside, I said to the waiter that I just couldn't drink it and he told me ""bring it to the bartender and ask him""
Maybe when he saw my face he decided it was his job to bring the drink back and try to do something about it.
So I don't really now what they did with it, changed the straws, add more water to it, I have no idea.
When I was finally able to drink it, it tastes like cinnamon water. And I'm not exaggerating.
My friend Karim came from Paris and I wanted to show him a good place. I was ashamed. Literally ashamed of what Montreal has to offer when it comes to cocktails.
This place is a joke.
I have no idea how it gets good reviews. Absolutely no ideas. But good for them I guess. Maybe I'm too picky.
Oh, if you're a fan of sucking hard to get cinnamon flavoured water : THIS IS THE PLACE",51356,1517,1518,1,"Poor. The bar is small and the vibe is OK. I am a Montrealer, and there are much better options. The reason for my poor review, however, is the staff and the manager. We were a group of 4 and had to start a tab. A friend gave a credit card which was put aside. When it was time to pay, the credit card was nowhere to be found. Lost. The staff ignored us as they walked back and forth (for some reason never looking on the ground). The bar tender finally told us that the card was lost. No plan of action though (i.e. call us in the morning if it is found). She gets the manager (who is clearly very drunk) and he immediately says that it is an unfortunate situation but we have to pay for our drinks right now. There was, however, no credit card to pay this tab. We only ordered about 6 drinks for the group of 4 and the card holder only had one drink. There was never any offer to let the drink of the card holder go to make up for this unsettling incident (which I think would have been the best approach). Instead the drunk manager told the customer to shut up, and asked me to 'take this outside'. The staff was incredibly unprofessional and the drunk manager was really disrespectful and had no intention of assuming any responsibility whatsoever. We left as soon as he told us to shut up. Without paying (the other 3 were ready to pay if the manager had taken a second to calm down and process our payments). Don't go here, its really not worth it.",51357,1519,1520,0,"After dropping a significant amount of money (multiple drinks, a tray of shots for our group and surrounding people, generous tips etc), a small unattractive 19 year old child who works at this establishment (who was off duty and drinking with friends), shoved a member of my party with all her strength to pass. He was irritated because it caused him to spill his drink and held his ground which in the end ended up moving her out of the way. She proceeded to shove him even harder, and then got one of the barmen to get the doorman and kick out group of 5 out of the bar while she laughed with her equally unattractive and immature friends. The barman who was serving us apologized (we'd been generous with him, and are a well off group in our late 20s early 30s). The barman who was in cahoots with this woman-child made an incredibly sexist statement to my friend by saying that she is a woman and is allowed to shove him, and also that she works here so she can do what she wants. This is unacceptable. I have been to this place multiple times, and have always enjoyed my evening, as well as spent a lot on drinks. She should not continue to work with the public if she is using her ""status"" as a bar waitress to be rude and obnoxious. The owner of this bar should realize that having such an employee is detrimental to their establishment and she shouldn't be allowed to interact with the public. Having worked in the public sector for many years, her attitude is not one I would accept as an owner or manager. Hopefully she will soon be out of a job, however if she isn't, she can continue her ""career"" cleaning up after bar patrons who have real jobs.",51358,1520,1521,2,"The first time I went to SuWu was in 2013. My initial impressions were that it had potential, but needed a lot of work with their service culture - one that values customers. I returned last night to discover that things had gotten worse. The people who work there are clearly biased towards people they know because they ignore everyone else. I have done a lot of traveling and this by far was the worst bar experience I've ever had. Getting a drink is next to impossible and believe me, I understand what bars are like on a busy night. Maybe if the bartenders weren't so concerned with making out with their boyfriends, dancing with their friends, singing along to some of the worst representation of ""hip hop"" I've heard, and getting drunk themselves they wouldn't have a bar full of clearly frustrated customers. However, to their advantage, the clientele is an average age of 18 and seem to have the memories of goldfish so they quickly forget about their bad experience. I'm sure the fact that most are already wasted helps too. It took 15 minutes to be acknowledged by a bartender. I order our drinks and proceed to watch her for another 10 minutes as she got distracted doing various things (everything, but making drinks) and then realize she forgot to serve me. Then the tap kicked so we had to wait another 15 minutes for that to be resolved, all for 3 beers. Because of the poor service, I wasn't planning on tipping, however that decision was taken from me as the bartender didn't return with my change. Granted it was only $3, but it was $3 I didn't want her to have. Overall, the service sucks here and maybe it could thrive if they replaced management and all staff. Lastly, hip hop is more than songs where every other word is a racial slur and lyrics that degrade women. I don't think whoever is in charge of music has any real knowledge of the genre and probably just played songs they heard on pop radio. I won't be returning.",51359,1521,1522,0,"Stopped here for a couple drinks before heading to another spot for dinner. Looked like a good crowd and it seemed like a happening little spot. Food and drinks were good but the service was terrible. We were visiting from Toronto for the weekend and our French is limited but the server seemed to be avoiding us at all costs and barely attempted to communicate with us. She actually came and cleared our food plates and didn't even ask if we wanted another drink (our glasses were clearly empty).
I get there may be some language differences but in any other situation I'd expect people to try to meet half way. In the service/hospitality industry I'd suggest staff should be going the extra mile to make their patrons feel welcome. Unfortunately we did not.",51360,1523,1524,0,"I came here for a book club, I loved the liveliness of this wine bar. This place is more of a tapas bar. The crowd was very casual- although there is a no reservation system, it took little time to get a table for 5. They had a wide wine selection- I was particularly intrigued Â by the orange wine- interesting to the palette. I loved that you can assemble your own charcuterie plate- with half or full portions of meats, veggies, and cheese. The liver mousse really stood out for me. They also had main course options if you are craving something more hefty as a meal.
My single complaint was the lack quality service: Too many clients to few staff members= poor service. I don't even recall how many time we had to flag down our server to 1) get us more bread 2) get us more bread (at some point we are ready to grab it ourselves) 3) stop taking away the menus because we specified we would be ordering more food later 4) keep reminding our server of the wine i wanted 2 or 3 times.

Yes he is very nice, and so are his colleagues, but the end result was very ugly. I showed him a picture of what I wanted, and he made my hair look somewhere between a china doll and cleopatra. Rather than having beautiful bangs, I have an ugly box on my forehead, short and thick, and worst of all, it continues that way to the sides. I swear I could have cut my own bangs much better. Also, the haircut on the rest of the head was very amateurish. I was charged a whopping $70 for it all. I had to go straight to Sephora to pick up some hair products to tame this ugliness. Not coming back here, ciao!",51366,1529,1530,0,"Mixed feelings. On one hand, the atmosphere is lovely, location convenient, and Daniel's technical skills are objectively excellent (I used to be a hairdresser, so I appreciate that). On the other hand, the haircut I got was not even close to what we agreed on. It took me years to grow my hair out, so the haircut being at least 3 inches too short is kind of a problem- think a bob sitting under the chin instead of softly layered below the shoulders cut. Full bangs are also something I didn't bargain for. My hair is wavy, and he haircut I got now requires a lot of product and styling to look good. Without styling it sadly looks like a frizz-bomb. I'm also quite upset that my hair clearly got washed with a sulfate shampoo, even though I stressed in the beginning that I had a keratin straightener in my hair. So that's a $300 anti-frizz keratin treatment gone in a blink on an eye, exacerbating the problem with styling my new haircut. The whole experience set me back $69 for cut and blow dry. A fair price in general. But, given that I got something that does not suit my lifestyle and that destroyed an expensive prior work, I can't really consider that a good deal. That said, the haircut itself is not bad and does suit my face- if I invest a lot of product and time into styling. Not sure how much good that is going to do with the upcoming fall winds and humidity though. I'm hoping the style will grow on me, but let's just say I'm not feeling it three days into the new 'do.",51367,1530,1531,2,"I had been searching for a good salon in Montreal for awhile.

They are significantly more expensive than the juniors/students.Â I wanted a balayage and a trim. Started with longer layers and blonde hair.Â After 4 hours and 300$ I walked out. Because of the loose curls in my hair, it looked ok. The cut and colour was not noticeable.Â After i got home and washed and blow dried it myself I noticed that it was COMPLETELY CROOKED. Like bottom layer is crooked. Random chunks are longer that the others. All the other layers are just randomly cut. I can't even explain it.

They tell me they don't offer free cuts...C'mon Aveda, bait and switch i the oldest trick in the book, and everyone sees it coming.

If you're reading this review as a first time customer, do yourself a favour and go somewhere else. This place isn't worth it, for all the cool vibe it claims to have and the prices it charges. Here's my experience: When I arrived (on time), the receptionist was on the phone. I waited a bit thinking she would be done soon now that she had seen me, but she just put her hand on the receiver long enough to tell me to take off my coat and hang it on the wall and take a seat. The colourist, Annie, came to get me about 10 minutes later. She seemed completely disinterested in doing her job. She spent barely 10 minutes with me, which included asking me what I wanted, then she went off to mix the color and came back and spent all of 5 min putting the dye in my hair. That was it. She disappeared for the next 35 minutes, without asking if I was comfortable, or offering any magazines to read. I went up to the reception area and got the magazines from the coffee table myself. She came back half hour later to tell me that my time was up and led me to the shampoo station where she handed me off to have my hair washed. I didn't see her again at all after that. She didn't check in to see how the color turned out or if I was happy with it. Another girl led me to a different station after washing my hair, and told me I could use the hair products and a hair dryer there to dry and style my hair myself before leaving. I was very surprised at this, as I have been to a lot of nice salons and I have never had an experience where they just dump me and tell me to style my own hair before I leave! Seriously, I don't know what I paid almost $80 for! This place wasn't the slightest bit interested in having my business as a new customer. Bottom line: I wouldn't recommend this salon AT ALL to anyone. There are plenty of places in Montreal, spend your hard earned money somewhere else where they care about providing good service.",51372,1535,1536,0,"I came here about a week ago to have my hair cut. I told Stephanie that I wanted side swept bangs falling a bit below my brows and what I got was definitely not that. I am left with a short chunk of hair that falls about half an inch above my eyebrows. I also paid almost $90 for the worst haircut of my life and the price I would pay was never made clear to me until I checked out. There is no transition between the ""bangs"" and the rest of my hair (which is quite long, making it very noticeable). I tried for a week to make it work and look good, but I couldn't so I went back today to see what could be done. Stephanie and the receptionist were both extremely rude to me even though I attempted to calmly explain the problem. Stephanie's exact words to me were, ""What do you want me to do? I can't make the hair grow."" and she was overall very dismissive of me and very unprofessional. The receptionist also LAUGHED at a friend of mine that had come with me when he asked a simple question. It is ridiculous to behave this way when you rely on tips and customer satisfaction to make your living. Since they were so unhelpful and disrespectful, I spoke with the owner, Jeff, who was very nice and understanding and offered to fix my hair for free once it grows out a bit more. I will update my review once he has fixed my hair.",51373,1536,1537,2,"I found the staff at the salon very unprofessional.Â I have been to Adikt salon before when it was still at the old location downtown and really enjoyed the hair cut and the service.Â When i came to the new location, i arrived 8 minutes early than my appointment time. The salon was closed, so I waited by the door.Â And then the most ridiculous thing happened. Salon staff started waving me to go away and not stand by the door. There was really not much to go away to and it was already 5 minutes to appointment, so I kept standing by the door. Instead of coming to the door and communicating with me, they kept waving me away in the most disrespectful way.Â I kept showing them with sing language to come to door and explain why they want me to go away, and finally they came..without introducing themselves, or apologizing for disrespectful behaviour, they told me to go wait elsewhere..because they are not open yet.Â Needless to say, I am never going back to this salon with such arrogant disrespectful customer service.",51374,1537,1538,0,"My story with Adikt was on a honeymoon until I talked to an obnoxious receptionist that informed me I had cancelled two appointments ""last minute"" and that they had this unwritten policy that ""people like me"" fdon't get to reserve over the phone, that I must come in person and prepay for the services in advance.Â Without getting into the illegality of such idiocy, I am sorry I won't put my hair in the trust of the much more decent stylists at the salon. Adikt management should know that their downtown clientele is made of busy people with crazy schedules and that we willingly pay the extra bucks for a professional and service-oriented salon.As for my ""crimes"", I was offered an empty spot, as a previous client had cancelled out. I was too quick to confirm and called back minutes later to cancel.Â By the Way, this cancellation policy ain't written anywhere nor communicated to any of the customers...what a shame.",51375,1538,1539,2,"Edit: Had to change this to a 1 star review (down from 5 stars) after two of their stylists literally dropped their blow-dryers on my head.

Horrible experience.",51376,1539,1540,0,"Yesterday was my first time at Helmet and my stylist was Danny.He sat me down and talked about what I wanted, and really seemed to understand. I had a long pixie that I wanted a LITTLE shorter and thinned out. I specifically said ""I don't want to back any shorter."" And he agreed.When he washed my hair he threw a towel around my neck, not secured, and water went in my eyes, ears and down my back.When he was done washing my hair he put a towel loosely around my hair and again, my hair soaking wet- water got in my eyes, all over me. And he didn't even notice! It was only at the point where I said ""There is a lot of water in my eyes and I wear contacts."" That HE GAVE ME THE TOWEL HE JUST ""DRIED"" MY HAIR WITH. And didn't say sorry for soaking me.With burning eyes and makeup down my face, he started cutting my hair... At first he took off some length on the top... but then he got to the sides and the first snip on the sides- I knew. WAY too short.The entire hair cut he was preoccupied with a street festival outside. There was one point where I even said something to him and he didn't hear me but just pretended to!? It was like a ""hi, how are you"" and he said ""you too!"" No exaggeration- I noticed him looking outside at least 20 times.As we got towards the end of the cut there were tears in my eyes and it was VERY clear I was unhappy. Very obvious he knew this. But he ""played it cool"" with belittling phrases like ""this is your first time going really short, you'll get used to it.""Instead of asking me if I liked it or if I was satisfied he literally said ""okay."" as if to cue he was finished, and polished off the experience by taking my cape off and then blowing all the loose hair on my clothes.This was by far the most unprofessional salon experience I've ever had.",51377,1540,1541,2,"Okay, I had mid-neck length hair, all one length, and slightly hanging-in-my-eyes bangs when walking in. I had a fairly simply idea in mind--as whenever I can afford getting my hair cut, I always ask for this cut, but I like to experiment with different hairdressers as they always cut it too short, but still a good cut.Â This was my first go at Helmet, and I was assigned Danny, which made me nervous because I read some things here on Yelp about him, but as I am an anxious, shy person I said nothing. I come in for my appointment, and am waiting 20 minutes before I get my hair washed, and then placed at a seat.Â Danny comes across as a bit of a snob who doesn't give two f**ks about what you have to say, and everything is in one ear and out the other. I had SEVERAL photo references, told him my hair was naturally wavy, even though I straighten it daily, but that I needed him to keep that in mind, and that I ABSOLUTELY did NOT want to go any shorter than an inch below my jaw-line in the front (and the back was to be shorter than the front), that I want asymmetrical bangs--long on one side, and shorter on the other, and I want SOME layers for added volume.Â What I got was basically a squared-off Frankenstein haircut with HUGE chunks of hair thinned out far beyond anything that was agreed upon. Random chunks of hair lobbed off at the top, which I guess was his version of layering, but he couldn't transition the layers nicely from one to the other, the front that was supposed to frame my face was thinned out so much and cut so short that I struggle to attain volume without using so much product in my hair. My bangs are cut almost in a zig-zag. Hands-down, this is the WORST cut I have ever received-- I almost don't want to leave the house, I'm so ashamed. Not to mention he was so unprofessional, and I was absolutely COVERED in my own hair-- in my eyes, down my shirt, in my mouth-- just everywhere. He just would not stop cutting, and the session went on for SO LONG. Never again.",51378,1541,1542,0,Jason is a nice enough guy but im living with a brutal hair cut that he gave me!!!

Without over sharing, let me just say their definition of a bikini line wax is the most conservative I have ever encountered. And I've had bikini waxes for more than a decade, in more than 20 salons.

Hey, if the place was busy, I'd understand but there was one other person there. Maybe they didn't realize I had an appointment & thought I was just there milling around? Quick hint, greet people that walk in the door. Maybe you would've known I was there to get my hair done & you wouldn't have been so rude. The experience didn't get any better from there. Of course if you cancel, they charge you anyway. Negates the need for good customer service...On to the actual blow out.

When they emailed back they said I would have to show it in person. A few days later someone called me and said I had to give a credit card over the phone as I wasn't local in order to keep my appointment. I'm not sure why that isn't mentioned online or was told me during my first email corrospondence. So I called back and gave my credit card number to hold the appointment.Â When I showed up they had just opened and everyone was sitting around looking bored already. Apparently who I had booked for an appointment was no longer seeing me, and a gentleman told me I was booked with him somehow instead. Not sure why honestly.Â I had thought getting my hair professionally blow dried would be a nice experience and make my hair look a little more voluminous or nice before getting styled, but this was honestly a waste of money for me and quite painful having my hair brushed out. I don't know why more leave in conditioner or detangler wasn't added, I have very very healthy thick hair and brought my own brush even and suggested he use that to brush my hair. He did a little bit, but it was never full brushed out or detangled and was yanked a lot. Just overall not very pleasant.Â Then for styling my hair it was a little better, not quite what I pictured from what I had shown but not something I could have done myself anyway.Â The appointment seemed a little rushed, I had planned on 2 hours and each appointment said it was booked for 1 hour but I was done in less than an hour and a half. The gentleman immediately walked out of the salon after I stood up and didn't say anything.Â I walked around asking if this is where I pay and they asked if I wanted a loyalty card and I said no I don't live in town. I paid and left a 25% tip and then shortly after realized I had forgot to ask about my 15% discount coupon. I returned to ask if I could have that applied and a partial refund and was flat out refused. They specifically knew I didn't live in town and just kept saying you can come back next time. There's just no way I am ever going to bother coming back here to have my hair tugged on and a blow out worse than I can do at home. Hair styling isn't needed all the time, just this time. I really don't believe them that it's impossible to offer a partial refund, every credit machine can have refunds done manually.Â When I got home and went to take out my hair it was quite hard to do and very very dry and messy.

Tip in general I believe should be optional left to the customers discretion to treat the company when they feel they received a good service. Giving you a bit more details: I required cleaning for my 3-bedroom house BEFORE we move in, so the house had no furniture in it. Now although it's a 3-bedroom house, which was not filthy, I specifically mentioned a few times that ALL I need is a thorough cleaning in the kitchen (exclude the floor), windows (5 of them, only interior) and ONLY the crawl space in the basement (and I asked to get rid of the spider webs). It took 4 hours for a team of 4 people (and almost $800 in cost) to NOT complete this. They mentioned they needed more time. After I returned I was told they didn't have time to clean behind the stove. Also although the crawl space was swept, the spider webs was untouched. Inside the cabinets were cleaned, but the cabinets doors were not cleaned properly. They did a good job with the windows and the fridge though. I feel 4 hours and 4 people and an $800 invoice should be sufficient to complete the job I've requested. I have tried other services before and I feel this was way too pricy and not worthwhile the service. I am disappointed that I had to complete the cleaning myself.",51401,1566,1567,0,"I am writing a second review in follow up of my Sept 11, 2012 review in which the cleaners did not show up for the appointment, or even call to let me know of any delay.The day after the missed appointment, I received a brief email from the owner simply saying 'sorry' - that was it, after the major inconvenience of their reschedule and the crew's failure to arrive on time. Unacceptable.I decided to give them another chance and they chose a new cleaning date of Sept 17. The afternoon before I received a call from the owner saying staff had called in sick and they were not going to be able to keep the appointment.I understand people get sick, but after already receiving terrible customer service, they should be going out of their way to make things right, and cancelling the night before wasn't the way to do that.So we rescheduled for a third time - I am expecting them today, Sept 25, in the next 10 min. I hope our house will actually get cleaned this time.",51402,1567,1568,1,"I am rating them simply on their customer service vs. cleaning, because they still have not cleaned my house - to do so, they'd actually have to show up!I purchased a voucher and couldn't get the date/time I needed so had to go with their availability. They were due to arrive at 1pm today and last night (less than 24hrs notice!) I got an email saying they had to push the appt back to 3pm. That posed a problem because I needed to be somewhere by 5:30pm so the owner said she'd send 4 people to have the house cleaned in 2hrs (instead of 3).At 4pm, no one had arrived or called to say they were going to be late! I emailed and then called the owner (I was unable to reach her).It's now after 6pm and they still haven't even extended me the courtesy of a call to apologize or explain.I understand others have had luck with this service, but if you're considering calling them, you have been warned.(I will update this at a later time...IF they come to clean).",51403,1568,1569,2,"I've found their service to be very inconsistent.

Â It's unfortunate as the first cleaning was really good.",51404,1569,1570,0,"I seem to have been lucky with Classic Maids!I bought a Dealfind voucher forever ago. Luckily, they don't expire, so maybe any rush to use the services had abated by the time I got around to booking them.Â They actually answered emails which is a major point in their favour with me, and something I've found is far from a given. They allowed me to book that way too which was very much appreciated. They even gave me a cancellation the same week which was fantastic-I was going away on vacation and wanted to treat myself to getting the place cleaned!They send a pretty extensive list of cleaning materials you'll need but seem flexible enough regarding actual versions so I didn't have to buy anything in the end except rubber gloves.Â My appointment was for 1pm on Saturday. I was a little surprised to arrive back to my building at 12.45pm to find the cleaner there and 16 missed calls on my phone. I suppose it's nice that she wasn't late-but I don't have the psychic abilities to predict that she'll be 30 minutes early and arrange my day accordingly.Anyway, the cleaner herself was very friendly and got to work after a quick tour. Any tour of a one bed apartment can't really take long. I went off to do errands and left her to it. I arrived back after 3 hours and 5 minutes and she was relaxing on the couch waiting for me. She wasn't particularly phased that I was 5 minutes late which was nice.As for the cleaning? It was pretty good. She did things I avoid-like scrubbing behind the toilet and cleaning inside the windows. She didn't clean inside the fridge or oven, she didn't clean under the microwave and don't think she dusted in my bedroom. She definitely didn't do anything like changing the bed linen. She didn't put stuff back where she found it so I had to rearrange when I got back. I actually think she was taking it upon herself to redecorate!All in all it was good. Hopefully there would be a more thorough cleaning if the cleaner was coming every single week. I think you could probably do more in 3 hours when there are only 3 rooms.

In the process of removing the cabinet they knocked over a drum of cooking oil they had in the truck. The oil spilled close to a gallon of putrid used cooking oil all over the streets in front of mine and several houses in the neighbourhood.

Apparently they do not recognize anyone but their immediate customers complaints - even if their companies actions have led to property damage to other parties.After contacting my neighbours, we called in together to complain about the issue. The company then forwarded the complaint to a local manager who contacted me over text message, where I had sent in photos of the problem.They sent out what we thought was a cleaning team of two, who spent 3 minutes looking at the oil spill and then drove off. I alerted the manager to this and she responded with ""they are investigating"". Further attempts at communicating with this manager has been simply ignored by her. It's been close to a month now and the oil spill has not been cleaned up. I believe the company is hoping the rain will wash it away, but there have been several major rainfalls but the oil does not wash away. We have contacted the company again about the issue and are met with the same ""we'll look into it"". Â This is fair warning for anyone considering using this service.

At no point did he show me the truck size. While the two men were very friendly I feel like I was completely ripped off. When signing the papers at the end, he asked for my signatures on a few items. One item had the top covered as of trying to cover it up because he explained the other form but not that one so when I briefly read it (that was already pre-circled for me), there was a section on if I was shown the size of the truck which I wasn't. At this point, I was tired as I was moving and had a lot to do so I just signed it. I can't imagine how many people are in the same boat.

In truth, the service I received historically was 3.5/5. The service was not as thorough as it should be, with missed patches and broken hairs, but the staff made up for it by being very personable. The spa has a nice feel and is well maintained.Â My negative review stems from a conversation I had with the manager surrounding delinquent membership fees. I subscribed to their membership on October 27th, 2015 which entitles me to UNLIMITED Brazilian waxing, and 10% or 20% off of other services for $35 a month. I went back on November 9th, 2015 for a subsequent Brazilian (and other services) before my wedding. I was then charged $35+tax on November 27th, 2015, and again December 27th, 2015. I did not go in for those services. In early January, my credit card was compromised, and all pre-authorized debits needed to be updated. After undergoing the process to recover my credit card, I decided I no longer want preauthorized debits to go through. Allure sent me emails regarding the failed transactions, and I did not notify them thinking I could just go in and pick up where I left off. Of course, I should have been more proactive. Of course, I should have let them know of my situation. Bottom line is that I didn't.Â I called to schedule an appointment to go in, and notified them of the situation. Since they could not accept post-dated cheques, and needed pre-authorized payment, the receptionist said I could get a pre-paid card. This takes about 2 weeks, so I offered to provide it when I got it. She said that wouldn't be a problem. I asked what would happen to the nearly $80 I had been charged without service and she said they would disappear. I didn't accept that and asked to speak to the manager.Frank, the manager, took over from there. While I was not hearing the answers I wanted to from the receptionist, at least she was pleasant. Frank was the opposite of professional and courteous. First of all, he equated the membership to a gym membership and said ""if you subscribe to a gym membership and don't go, would you ask for your money back?"". This is an incorrect analogy. What Frank should have asked was ""If you purchased a personal training package scheduled for x number of sessions and missed two sessions, would you ask for those sessions back?"" To which the obvious response is YES. I'm not asking for money back, I'm asking for the money I've paid to be applied as a dollar amount to services. Frank's resolution was that since I had a service November 9th (which was included as part of my October payment) I could receive December's payment as a credit. Ultimately, since I used a service I was entitled to on November 9th, November 27th would pay for that. He claimed that I wanted $80 of service for $35. This was not the case.Â Do I accept responsibility for the lack of communication? Yes. However, in the interest of customer service and retention, do I believe Frank was fair? Absolutely not. I was prepared to fix the problem and remain loyal, but I did expect service for money paid. He felt that I was being cheap and asking for services I was not entitled to, and made sure I was well aware of how he felt.Â I, of course, will not be returning and hope they change their policies to be more catering for the client. This industry relies heavily on word of mouth and sadly I don't have a lot of good things to say about Allure.",51428,1596,1597,2,"I have been getting Brazilian waxing done for years. I went to Allure after work one day when I happened to be in that area of town. I thought that, as a wax-only establishment, they would have perfected the service. I was very wrong. The employee (I forget her name) was unprofessional. She was complaining to me about how she had to work from 12 to 8 pm instead of her usual 12 to 5 because her colleague was missing work to get a mammogram result (seriously). Perhaps she took her anger out on me because this waxing experience was by-far the most painful I have ever experienced. And I have had a lot of Brazilian waxed done over the years. If this was my first one, I would NEVER get another one EVER. Fortunately I know better and will just never go back to Allure for any service.",51429,1597,1598,1,"I'm not sure why most of the reviews are praising 'painless' waxing experiences because mine hurt like hell.

I've had Brazilian waxes for 5-years, and it usually doesn't hurt that much.Â Although, Alaa waxed pretty quickly (thank god) in a dark room, I thought she did a good job at that time. It was not till I got home, I saw that ALL of my pores down there were bleeding and red. Â It was painful to even touch that area, and it felt like pins and needles were poking me. I also noticed her waxing was not thorough - I obviously couldn't see the spots she missed in the dark room.Â Irregardless of the poor waxing job done (and the painful days thereafter), the service was very good. Alaa was very friendly, and reminded me to review her business on Yelp and Like them on Facebook.

Avoid if you want any kind of pedicure.",51431,1599,1600,1,"Would not recommend this spa at all, and definitely will not be going back.Got the ""Just a Taste"" spa package (30min swedish massage, mani, facial) which I clearly had booked and stated to the receptionist upon arrival but we'll get to that later...Massage was ok. No ambiance or music to speak of but overall good for a quick 30 mins.I had my manicure and facial scheduled with Rebecca. Alarm bells first went off when she brought in a tub of water and began to set up for a pedicure. Despite my insistence that I had booked a manicure, she continued to set up until she took a closer look at the log form. Instead of setting up the room for a manicure, which she explained usually involves a table, she merely left me half lying down on the table so I had to awkwardly twist for her to reach my nails. I was disgusted to see that she continually used the same towel to catch my nail filing's to wipe my hands and to apply lotion.Facial was ok but I was shivering at this point.Coming back to the receptionist, still in a bit of a post-massage haze, I was charged for my procedures. It wasn't until I was leaving the building that I noticed she had charged me for each individual procedure rather than the package, charging almost $20 over the actual price. When I returned with my receipt she was at first in denial over her error and finally, begrudgingly attempted to refund my money and re-charge the actual amount. Instead, although the receipt read 'Transaction cancelled' she assured me my money had been refunded.Of course, as I returned home, both charges appeared on my bank statement. Unable to fix the problem over the phone and having to speak more with this incompetent receptionist, I eventually had to go out of my way to return to the spa and refund my money in person, receiving only a brief and unconvincing apology despite the huge inconvenience for me.Needless to say, I will not be returning and I recommend you do not either.",51432,1600,1601,1,"This was the worst massage I've ever had in my life.

I filled out the paperwork and wrote on it a couple of times that my problem area is my right shoulder blade. My masseuse didn't even look at the the form and when I went in the room she just told me to take my clothes off and cover up with the blanket. She didn't ask me any questions. She left the room and I did so.She came back and asked me where I had pain. I told her my right shoulder blade. She even touched it and repeated me. But she spent barely any time on it and I even asked her at one point if she could go back to it. She rubbed over it a lot but I have knots in there that really need out. I kept expressing the soreness in that area and the knots that I have. She focused a lot on my neck which is also a problem but I was specifically there for the shoulder blade. Even if she couldn't get the knots out I just really needed her to try.Â And then she told me to sit up which I thought was odd. But they obviously have different massage techniques here so I went with it. I held the blanket up with one hand as she was doing stuff with my other arm and then switched sides. But then she took both arms to do something else and I was sitting there topless... She was behind me but still. I'm a very open person and I actually don't care about being topless in front of other women. (I'm a performer and have quick changed so many times in front of other cast and crew.) It just seemed weird to me... maybe I'm ignorant to the technique or the Asian culture. But usually you ask someone if that's alright, right?Then she finished what she was doing as I was sitting up and just told me, ""Okay, finished. You feel good?"" I didn't really know what to say... I just kind of smiled and said yeah. I also don't think I got a full 45 minutes. I know I went in a couple minutes early but I don't think I went in 10 minutes early.Anyway, my neck is really sore now from the massage (which I know can be expected) but my right shoulder blade is still the same as before.

She did not use cuticle oil or water on my nails so I've been putting antibiotics on my nails since this awful experience. I'm officially traumatized from getting a mani pedi.

This was anything but.The staff was awful. They barely spoke English. I booked an appointment for myself and an appointment for my husband right after me. When I arrived, I explained to her that I would be redeeming a Groupon for both me and him. She insisted that I had not booked my husband's appointment and that he would have to reschedule because she was ""busy"" and that I had to contact him to reschedule the appointment. Yep, me, not her. Thanks for the heads up, lady.I thought maybe there was something lost in translation and tried to figure out if she understood that the next appointment she was ""busy"" with was my husband. I tried to tell her that she should have been ""busy"" with the appointment I booked days in advance for him, but it was unclear whether or not she understood. She continued to insist he could not come in. She took down the Groupon number for both Groupons anyway, even though I was the only one that actually received service.After all of that confusion, I turned to the masseuse who seemed to be waiting for something to do. I had showed up in sweats, and just before I was about to walk in to the room the staff stopped me to ask if I was pregnant. I thought maybe this was some kind of medical question for safety, but when I said no the entire staff was beside themselves laughing, clearly because they thought I was fat. No apologies, or even a hint that this was some kind of awkward laughter at their mistake. They just thought it was funny to insult me. I nearly walked out, but I had already paid, and thought you know.... I came all the way out here. At the very least I can get what I came for.The massage itself was terrible. It was noisy in the spa, one of the male workers kept talking loudly to the masseuse through the door. The massage ""rooms"" where more like bathroom stalls in that the walls were thin and didn't go into the ceiling. So joy for me when a wedding party who had also bought Groupons came in and I could hear their entire conversation like they were in the room with me.Â Since the masseuse spoke zero English, there was no way to communicate to her what I needed and where it hurt. She was also doing strange things that seemed like a way of buying time to get through the 60 minutes, such as lifting up my extremities as high as possible and then dropping them on the table repeatedly, and sticking her fingers in my ears and swirling them around before wiping her fingers on my hair.After the masseuse lifted up both my legs above her head for the 30th time, she unceremoniously dropped them while yelling ""FINISH!"" then walked out of the room and shut the door. I dressed myself as quickly as possible, but I couldn't escape fast enough. The woman at the front desk yelled and stopped me to pay ""tax"" just as I set foot on the pavement outside. She then rung up $5.00 plus tax on a machine and then told me it was time to tip her. I paid the amount so she would let me leave. I've never been asked to pay extra ""tax"" on any other Groupons before, and think this was her way of screwing me out of a few extra bucks.I paid for ONE Groupon, I went though the experience. But now I discover that they've redeemed both Groupons. So now I get the joy of trying to get a refund for Groupon for services they claim to have rendered.I've never been so insulted and furious with such terrible and selfish service.

They also mopped the floors and cleaned up in my spa room while I had a mask on because they were closing. I felt uncomfortable the whole hour.

Then the young man said ""take this money and go, don't come back"" (a partial refund?) and then another employee chimed in, while the customer yelled they had damaged her stomach or something, totally relentlessly arguing.

But I was shocked at how poor the bodywork was here. It literally just felt like she had been randomly called upon to rub my feet and back. There was no proper reflexology technique used, and the ""shiatsu"" was just her elbows being dug into me. I don't think she actually hit one real pressure point.To be honest, the level of expertise of the massage here was so low, that I started to suspect that maybe this place was an ""exotic"" massage parlor and that I'd made a terrible mistake. The fact that I heard several men come in and ask for one particular woman by name didn't help that. Nor did the fact that they used Jerkins and baby oil for the massages. While most of the women working there were dressed in comfy yoga pants, I also was a bit thrown that one employee was wearing heeled wedges and a denim mini skirt (in the middle of winter, no less).

Also, if for some reason you don't bring headphones with you when you workout, there's no music playing in the gym.Also, the stretching areas are basically just two mats side by side, there's pretty much only room for two people and you're so close to each other it's super awkward. There's only two ""areas""; one on the 2nd floor and one on the 4th.Â The only things I like about the gym is that I can use one of the bikes in the cycling room and there's nobody else in there and they have a super spacious hardwood floor studio room on the 3rd floor that I used to stretch, however there's no mats to use. But it could also be used for cardio (i.e. sprints, agility training, plyometrics, etc.) or skipping rope.I guess it's a decent gym if you just want to go to spin classes, walk on the treadmill, use the hip abductor machines and/or play pickup sports. Other than that, I'd suggest you find another gym to go to.",51460,1632,1633,1,"Equinox membership is a total rip off. The classes are always full and there aren't enough showers in the women's locker room. You have to wait in line to take a shower after a class. Plus there's a theft issue in the locker room. Women steal other women's belongings while in the shower. And Equinox management does NOTHING about it, even though they have security footage. Appalling for a club that charges over $200/month. Join Adelaide Club or Mayfair instead.",51461,1633,1634,2,"This place used to be great - and I would know, I was a member for almost 5 years - but now I would not recommend signing up. Â First off, their administrative staff is either not competent or just don't care - dealing with billing, membership options, gift cards or anything similar feels like pulling teeth. Once I was charged $146.75 for a training session I didn't book or actually have and it took two months for a refund. I had to talk to an assistant manager several times and often left voicemails that were never responded to. Secondly, it is getting more and more crowded and every time I workout, I see the membership advisors giving more tours. Â Part of this problem was highlighted in another review - there are so many people with trainers on the floor, the amount of bodies is absolutely insane. Â Further, some of the newer trainers are disrespectful of those working out by themselves, asking to ""work in"" and then just taking over your equipment. Â The final straw for me in this respect was when one trainer set up equipment so close to me I just about had a weight land on my foot. Â I understand that your poor client is spending upwards of $130 a session, but that doesn't give you the right to take over the gym. Â Third, ""rush hour"" workouts have become untenable unless you are willing to fight for space and deal with an increasingly douchey bro culture. Â I am sad to leave but not sure how I can justify $200 a month for what is now a similar vibe to goodlife during peak hours (with the added bonus of dozens of 20 something year old trainers who are probably insta famous).",51462,1634,1635,0,"Besides for the excellent amenities, I have had a terrible experience with the staff. Breanna in particular was condescending, rude and completely dishonest when it came to keeping her word. PSA to any current or potential gym members, I suggest you ask to deal with a different manager. Such a shame because Equinox is truly a beautiful, clean gym, but the staff are driving it into the ground.",51463,1635,1636,2,"I'm updating my review because I haven't been to this club in months. The Gym doesn't open early enough (it should open at 5 am so people who work can work out before going to work) and it should be open later (perhaps closing at midnight).Â In addition to the hours not being convenient, the hot yoga classes are always fully booked. They should really add more to the schedule and have them at times people can actually attend with the common 9-5 plus traffic daily grind.None of the high energy group classes start early enough for me to attend and the evening class schedule is not convenient. I just went to sign up for a class that just opened for online scheduling 10 minutes ago and it is already full. This is really ridiculous!Update 3:They gave terrible customer service and really rude employees working at the front desk who don't seem to care about retaining customers, which is what keeps them in business. They constantly send flyers to my house asking me to sign up when I'm already a member (talk about bad advertising) and their front line employees don't care when long time members are fed up with the horrible service and say they are going to cancel their membership. To be successful this gym needs to get all employees in line with their mission.Â I'm officially looking for a new gym now.",51464,1636,1637,0,"I joined womens fitness @ promenade 1 month ago ....left goodlife for a change. Â There are some good instructors and classes but the gym is way too congested...and very cliquey. It is too small for too many women and it is always busy...does not matter if it is during the day or weekend etc. Advanced online reservation of many classes fills up within 5 min. While I am happy they brought new weight machines which were desperately needed .....there is not enough space when a lot of people are working out, talking nearby or when there is a line up of people waiting to get into the class. I have taken a few classes Â and there is no space to move which feels unsafe and claustrophobic. So far not impressed and missing my old goodlife which was a far better experience for the 15 years I belonged.",51465,1637,1638,0,"After my experiences with this gym, all I have to say is that the team must be very disorganized. Initially, I wanted to get a membership for me and my mom, so I went to the front desk to ask about memberships. Receptionist was not very helpful and wasn't really in the mood to give an overview of what the gym offers, so later we went home and called the gym to ask about a membership. This time, we talked to someone who seemed to be experienced with memberships and she was quite helpful. She introduced us to a few different options, and I told her I would need a little more time to decide what was right for me. We made an appointment for around 7pm that evening, so I could decide what I wanted before coming in to finalize the deal. She asked us for our credit card information to 'make signing up easier when we got there.' However, that was not what happened at all.Later that evening, around 6 or 7pm, I decided we didn't want to go to this gym after all. Since we hadn't signed anything or even picked a membership option, I simply gave them a phone call to let them know I did not intend to sign up anymore. I spoke with the receptionist, who told me she would tell the person in charge of memberships about my decision. Obviously, I thought the matter was settled.When I received my credit card statement that month, however, I saw that the company had signed me up for two different memberships (I assume this because of multiple charges with different prices) for both me and my mom, without my knowledge or consent. Apparently, the person in charge of my membership had decided that I was as good as signed up (even though I didn't pick an option yet, or sign any paperwork) and the receptionist didn't tell her about my phone call or something. I called the company and was initially told that cancelling a membership would take additional paperwork which I would have to come in sign, which I refused to do since I never signed up for a membership in the first place. I then talked to the manager, who said she would look into it and give me a call back (which she never did). I never got any more word of this matter until I called them, at which point they told me there was a refund cheque for me sitting in their office. The manager did mention that they only did refunds by cheque, which you could pick up or have mailed to you, but I never got any indication that my cheque was ready and my refund was processed. A bit upsetting, but since I got my refund, I wasn't too upset.Nonetheless, I got my credit card statement again and realized they were still charging me. I called them again, and spoke to management, who said she would have to confirm my situation with the person in charge of memberships and call me back (which also didn't happen). Apparently, they had only cancelled the membership for me and not my mother, even though we were under one account and I had indicated that we were both signed up against our will. Went to the gym later and picked up the second refund cheque (which we also weren't notified of).Â I get my credit card statement this month again, and they're still there. Some kind of 16.45 a month membership that they still didn't refund us for, or discontinue. Called them today but management already went home (which is fair enough, it was 9pm). This whole thing started in November, and still they're charging me for a service I didn't agree to or use. There is no reason they should have started charging me (again, didn't pick an option or sign anything, only indicated interest - why was I even signed up for several memberships??) and there is no reason they should be continuing to charge me. I have talked to them so many times about refunding and discontinuing the memberships, but they fail to respond in an acceptable manner - why don't they cancel everything together, knowing my situation? Why don't they ever indicate to me that my refund is being processed? I know not everyone is around at my whim, but it'd be great if they could tell me what's going on when the manager has spoken with applicable people and checked the files, especially if she indicated to me she would call me back. I'm sure the gym itself is lovely and the people are polite, but there is something wrong with their teamwork and organization.Edit: I spoke to them just now, for the most part they were polite and helpful but U was told they were 'making an exception' for me since I had 'accidentally signed up.' How did I accidentally sign up?? I only called them to ask about membership plans and I hadn't even told the person on the phone which one was right for me. I gave my credit card information because I was told that it would facilitate the sign up process when I got to the gym to finalize the deal, and I called the same evening to tell them I wasn't interested anymore. Would anyone call that 'accidentally signing up'? Shouldn't a sales rep wait until I pick an option and sign forms to sign me up??",51466,1638,1639,1,"If you find yourself thinking about joining this gym, turn and run the other way!I joined System Fitness last year thinking it would be a great local place I could go to work out and get back in shape.

Or so I thought...The poor administration failed to properly record my cancellation, and charged my credit card for the full yearly rate. This was in August. Some 25 business days later, I have yet to receive a single dollar back (they legally have 20 days to issue refunds) and have yet to receive a consistent date, or story as to when I will.This old, run down gym is coupled with an even more incompetent staff.

Not all women need to lose weight or get that ""summer bod"" as he kept suggesting as some people are satisfied with their body. He kept saying how I should prepare for the summer and have a goal or else I'll fail. Again no there doesn't need to be goal to join the gym, not everyone has one. Some people want access and the ability to do some light cardio. I don't think everyone needs to have the ideology they need to get abs and a 6 pack when joining the gym. There are a lot of other reasons.Â I solely wont be joining the gym due to its body shaming nature and attitude towards women.

Michelle's class lacked clarity, command, and proper instruction/modification for those with injuries. Amenities were beautiful but everything else did not live up to my expectations.

The smoothie bar is located downstairs and is really expansive. I love that they had a water filter right in the locker room. However, that being said your probably wondering why this is a 1 Star rating. Boutique classes come at a cost- this one was specifically $32 and while you pay for the space and amenities I come for the class. Michelle was the instructor and I began on the floor- we did crunches, v sit ups and lots of toe touches for 10 minutes. I don't know about you but that's an ab workout you can do at home without an instructor present, nothing interesting at all and completely all on your back. She didn't ask once about injuries and with pain in my lower back and knees it became laborious to continue with these movements over and over. I clearly was in pain and kept stopping but wasn't offered any modifications. I also looked around and based on Michelle's instructions most people were confused on when to start a movement for those on the floor and when to end based on her instructions for those on the treadmill. She was unable to keep command or control of the room at all. I hopped on the treadmill and am aware that running due to my PTs instructions is not encouraged at incredibly fast speeds but incline is the best way to go. The woman next to me continued to ask what are we doing? What speed? Because once again Michelle had no command of the room. The 10 minute treadmill work out included a run backwards and sideways. My friend who came with me didn't feel comfortable running backwards and Michelle came over and physically moved her rather than asking her permission. She then went and called me out 4x by saying ""I bet this isn't how they do it NYC"", "" Is this how you workout in NY Taara"" which neither my friend or I found to be funny or necessary as we did not know what was being asked of us due to the lack of command and clarity. Michelle was overall an uninteresting teacher when it came to movements, taking care of injuries or individuals and incredibly condescending in her tone the multiple times she used my name and a comparison to NYC studios. While I do live in NYC and receive incredible classes from expert instructors, the comparison was one she offered but remains to be seen.

You have to physically write on a piece of paper why you're leaving. They won't accept an email. My brother was at least given a piece of printer paper to write his reason. I was told to leave, write it down, and return the next day.Manager/owner attitude is the worst and most unwelcoming you'll come across. The exact opposite of what you want when going to the gym but typical of what you should expect from a mediocre-low level, outskirts of downtown, calls themselves ""boutique"" gym.

They were too quick (and not busy, only client there on a cloudy afternoon). They also don't use any professional grade equipment. They are using old dish cloths to dry the car, no windex or cleaning products for the interior windows, dash or plastic surfaces. They don't have an air compressor to remove water from hard-to-reach areas nor do they try to remove bug stains, the list goes on. Oh and they're rude and hostile when you point out that the car isn't cleaned to a customer's satisfaction.

I told her I've been going to carwashes for 20 years almost every week and have never been so unhappy with a wash. I came on to Yelp and realized they have a horrible reputation.

Â Find another number on the glass door of the dog wash, and man answers, says he will be there in 3 minutes.Another couple stop by wanting to wash their dogs, we tell them we are waiting for someone to fix the machine! Â We suggest our usual place, Wash n Go on Dundas West and Scarlett Road... we are wishing we went there instead of trying this place!The guy does show up and after opening up the machine discovers, like we said, it is not accepting more coins... fiddles with internal buttons for a while and then it recognizes the coins and the water starts.

Â They have a token machine if you don't have loonies and toonies and tons of those vending machines selling auto related wipes.They also have a machine that you can pay to have your carpet floor mats cleaned.Â The coin car wash price is $2 per cycle. I think you get 2:40, which is reasonable.Â I Would like to hear a louder noise that you are almost out of time, so I can add more money.Â Also, the bays are drive through.

Very nice guys but frankly, that's not enough.., we were looking for professional movers to move us from our old home to our new home, and we were disappointed.It started wrong when they came in about an hour late.., then they were just not very professional. Couldn't handle heavy stuff, and tried to dismantle anything they could to avoid moving heavy items (like our elliptical). They were not prepared for our move (we asked a few times before our date if they want to see our house and what needs to be moved upfront, but they kept saying they don't need to see it) and it took them too long.The only positive I have to say is that they were super nice!, unfortunately this is not what we needed, we needed good movers..Update:So the owner is claiming this is a fake review..?, so I'm attaching a picture of their truck loading our stuff in our driveway. If you zoom to the left you can see that it says In&Out (the picture was taken to send to our family when we moved, not for putting here, so it didn't capture the name properly, but it is easily seen and the owner can also recognize his license plate on the top left).",51530,1708,1709,0,"I hired In & Out Movers to pack my place and move across town. Â One star is for the great job packing. Â They arrived on time, packed everything really well and nothing broke in the move including my many crystal wine glasses! Â However I had to provide my own packing materials which was something new for me. Â And perhaps using towels, sheets, pillow cases, table cloths and even a woven rug was the reason everything that was packed survived the move. Â Be prepared to supply your own if you go with their packing services.One star is for the guys who packed me and moved me the next day. Â They were professional and personable and made the move very easy and did I mention their great packing skills?However I cannot give a star for their customer service. Â After I booked the reservation Â I repeatedly asked Tony for a formal quote in writing. Â Not only did I not receive one, he never responded to my phone calls or emails. Â It got to the point two days before my move I called to ask if I was going to receive their services. Â After the move I called and emailed again to complain about how the movers handled the disassembly and assembly of my beds, to give them the benefit of resolving this before my review and I've not received any communication from either my message or email. Â Which leads to why another star was removed. My expectations were not managed in regards to what to expect the day of the move. Â I was told by Tony that there would be a three man crew during my move: two to do the moving and one to do the disassembly/ assembly of my two beds and shelving unit. Â This would expedite the move and keep costs low. Â This didn't happen.

Â Since there were only two guys - they didn't take their time disassembling my bed frames nor did they complete the assembly of these beds at my new location. Â My guest bed is actually broken because instead of taking it completely apart, they tried to move it while still partially assembled. Â Granted it was an Ikea bed, but the holes have been stripped, screws and pieces missing, where my former neighbours called and saved the pieces for me to pick up to try to put it back together. Â My other bed was only partially assembled with none of the bolts/screws tightened so I had to complete their job. Â They said they didn't have the right tools, which I don't want to fault them for but again my expectation was that these guys have plenty of experience with assembling/disassembling furniture both Ikea and not, where they should have a set of Allen wrenches and a ratchet set. Â Pretty standard stuff really. Â And I understand we were working on a timeline (move had to be done by 2:00) but they arrived at 9 am and if they had that third worker, I don't think there would have been any problems.

At this point, one of the movers started going on about his sneaker collection only that he doesn't keep his in boxes because that's dumb. Cool, good for you, right? When all was said and done, the move took about 5 hours and we thought everything was good and great and done with. Only the next day when we started organizing everything, we found that there were some items that were not where they were supposed to be.Energy Crew stole from us.

Now, either that mover who was talking his face off is as dumb as he sounds (he played himself) or, one of the other two movers are real smart and recognized that dude was talking waayyyyy too much and stole it to make him look like the one. Also, they stole our drill for good measure, because why not at that point.Furious, I took to emailing the company and got their Director of Sales who couldn't believe that this had happened and promised to do what he could (like search the truck...two days later...because that's where thieves keep the things they stole).

I've moved once every two years for the past ten years and never had such an issue with a moving company.Â We used Joe the Mover to move from an apartment in Oakville on the 15th floor to an apartment in Toronto on the ground floor. At first, they showed up and cleared our apartment quietly and patiently and just worked. But then, they took over an hour to show up to the Toronto apartment and we had enough time to leave, get lost, arrive, talk to management about the parking garage, and then we still waited about 20 minutes for them to get there. We figured they just went to get food or something even though we had already seen them take a lunch break but it was fine.But then when they arrived, they smelled of alcohol. We hope the driver wasn't drinking, but really all three of them smelled of alcohol and they acted very rude and impatient. They complained about management not letting them park out front even though there is a mover's entrance, and about the small set of stairs leading up to our hallway (as if we could help that). They yelled at us impatiently from the door about where to put furniture like we were children when we didn't respond immediately (we were walking over to the door to see what it was, we weren't slacking off and even if we were--don't talk to your paying customers like children).Â Then they started bringing in the boxes (which were very very clearly labelled) and asked if we wanted them in specific rooms or just in one place ""because putting them all over in one place is cheaper and faster"" which clearly shows what he wanted to do. We just told him to drop them all off in the living room because at this point we just wanted them out of our place. But when they began, they were clearly ignoring the very huge and very red FRAGILE labels and were practically throwing the boxes on top of one another. Books on top of glass, plates, etc. Two entire boxes of plates and serving dishes were completely broken, and the boxes looked like they had been dropped from a fair height. And we had wrapped everything up as carefully as possible. We KNOW how to wrap breakables--we have moved about 5 times in 10 years.So we pretty much had to sit and watch them bring the boxes up so we could go and take the fragile ones out of the pile and half of them they were placing upside down. They basically could not care less about doing their job right. And to make matters worse, after a while the alcohol smell got stronger still and their work got even slower.

I had a terrible experience and I ended up reporting them for fraud. They installed a knockoff fake screen, instead of a real one, on my Samsung phone after it shattered. The colour was off, tinted slightly green and very dim, the brightness adjustment didn't even work. On top of that my home button was loose and would get stuck underneath the screen. I had to argue with him for at least 20 minutes until he finally agreed to re-adjust the button and install a new screen that did work.. Unfortunately he didn't have more screens so he told me to return the following day for a working screen. I did just that but the new screen also didn't work and I asked him if it was a real samsung screen and he assured me it was. I then decided to get a second opinion from a nearby spot by Dundas and University, called ""Ming Wireless"". They were able to show me that he installed a fake and faulty screen, as they compared it to the real screens they had. I had them installed the correct screen for me for only $20 more than Tech zone charged and my phone worked perfectly and the colour and brightness was spot on. I went back to Tech zone and the technician admitted it wasn't a real Samsung screen and that he also puts fake screens on laptops and it's no big deal. This is not okay, it's fraud!!

Save yourself the time and money.My first trip with my husband was to fix his microphone as Apple said it was going to be quite expensive, we tried iRepex.However, once arriving we were greeted by the owners wife who was very kind and gave us pricing and let us know we could trust them.We trusted them with $120 worth of microphone repairs and replacing the screen.We agreed to do the iPhone screen and not the after market screen because we wanted it to look good. Upon arriving after 3 hours of them ""fixing"" the phone, we came back and found the screen looked a bit off. We thought, oh.. alright and then went to the desk to pay and he told us the price and how we would like to pay and if everything looks alright. We then mentioned no the screen is not properly placed on the phone. The gentleman then said ""oh yes I was going to tell you, don't worry don't worry. I was going to tell you that because we didn't have the iPhone screen we had to put the after market on today. So I will charge you the $80 now and the extra $40 next time you come back to replace once I get a new iPhone screen shipment."" Of course I was thinking, why did he not tell us before we mentioned it? Strange.So we let it go and my husband went back and he said it would take 30 min next time we came in but it took 1 hour. Understandable, it can take time so no problem with that. But then he gets home and the phone screen does not work on the left hand side at all and sometimes does not work in the middle.At this point I was upset because I have to travel on my only day off past Finch station to visit this repair shop again. I call him Friday to say the phone screen is not working and he tells me it might be because of the battery and to check the health. I said I would but could he fix it and how much would it cost. He said for free and I said okay I will come tomorrow. Fred then agreed for me to come in on Saturday anytime saying he could fix within 30 min. Please note while we were having this phone conversation he would never let me speak and was yelling in my ear.Here comes Saturday and I go to the shop trusting we can get it fixed within 30 min. I show up and there are 2 pairs of people in front of me complaining about the service they received. Yet he offers no discounts or my money back. Then it's my turn and I go to him and ask him if he remembers me and he says yes. I then show him 2 videos of times my husbands phone screen was not working since we got the screen replaced. I also informed him the battery health was 85% and fully functional according to the settings. He told me, ""no actually that is not good. I told him yes it is I already called Apple because I know you would say that"" he said ""okay?"" While giving me a very rude and strange look. He then said okay he would fix it but sorry he doesn't have the parts.That is when I almost lost my mind. I told him you know what, we had a phone call yesterday and this is my 3rd time back due to errors the shop had made. I told him it was ridiculous and he then told me to stop being rude because then he would not fix it for free. He said he would hold the phone for a few days and send to me for free. I didn't trust him anymore and I was blunt and told him he would be getting a bad review. I left upset and will never go back.I WISH I HAD FIXED MY PHONE WITH APPLE TO SAVE MYSELF THE TIME AND TROUBLE. Lesson learned.You might now be thinking, but it's so cheap! But is it worth it to come back 3 times for free to try and fix it after and it doesn't work? NO!!!!At your risk, please think about if it is worth it to go to this shop and experience this for yourself.Thank you for those who took the time to read this review.Have a wonderful day!",51589,1773,1774,0,"This store location was recommended by others. Â I got a broken glass on my Samsung S4. Â It costs $100 to replace it. Â I returned after more than 2 hours and my phone was ready. Â The first observation I found was there was an inch scratch on the newly replaced glass. Â So I asked the counter how come it looked like that for a new glass. Â She said the store did not carry enough glue for the glass and would be fine if I came back next week. The friendly Korean technician standing there also agreed.The following week after the glue was added, the same scratch was there. Â The girl at the counter said it would be like that given $100 was the cheaper way to replace the glass and the scratch was with the LC underneath it. Â To have no scratch, both the glass and LC had to be replaced to be perfect. Â The broken phone I handed over did not have that scratch, so it was nothing to do with the LC. Â She mumbled and explained something that did not make sense.Given money was paid the first time when I got the phone back, what bargain chip did I have on my hand to argue reasonably with them. Â On top of the scratch, the phone that was handed back to me the glass screen was extremely dirty as if it was from a warehouse for a long time. Â She managed to clean half of the dirt. I was afraid that her way of cleaning would give more scratches on the glass, so I took the phone and away from the store.Not a good customer service.

The price seemed very good, but in hindsight, it was a horrible decision to go with Downtown Flooring.Â Problems:1. Hardwood is low quality: Don't fall for the marketing. They provide very cheap brands. I used their Torly's brand. The wood scratches so easily. A friend who recommended this brand to me shortly after getting it installed himself also now regrets his decision. I've lived in three houses with hardwood. In a couple of months, the condition of the wood looks worse than after decades at my previous homes.Â 2. Installation was low-quality: Â Sometimes trims were too short. Nails stuck out on trims and were dented/hammered in. Hardwood didn't reach the trim in four cases, which led to a gap showing between the wall and the trim. Very shoddy work on the molding around a pillar.Â 3. Sub-Contractors were not provided all of the proper pieces for installation: Not enough trim was provided to the installers. This wasted a lot of time, because they had to come back three times. Twice they brought back the wrong trim. Â 4. Sub-contractors were unreliable: Although the subcontractors came back twice more, they flaked on four occasions. They were only willing to come back if they were working nearby in the neighbourhood, and could drop by when it was convenient for them.Â Conclusion: Cheap product, they sub-contract their work to unskilled talent to save money, managers don't have attention to detail.",51609,1796,1797,1,My experience with Downtown Flooring (when they installed an expensive hardwood floor in a large area of my home) was the worst I have had with any contactor I have used.

Lying about needing a part to fix our home Air-Conditioning unit and, thereby, 3). Running a scam. Here's what happened:We were at the beginning of a 9 day heatwave when our all home AC quit. Our Home Warranty Company put in a service order with Custom Controls Associates and gave us their phone number to follow up and to explain the situation and what we needed. They were going to be unable to get to us for a number of days despite our Home Warranty Co. explaining to them that we needed priority placement on their service list because the air quality coupled with the temperature was very likely going to result in the necessity for me to spend nights in the hospital. When we called we got a personal voice mail that simply said, ""Hi, this is Lilly. Please leave me a message"". I left a message for Lilly though I felt unsure I'd actually contacted any company at all because it was so unprofessional. When I called back, twice, later in the day, I got two more messages each different than the first and only one with the company name. This was unsettling. When I did get a call back, it was from Lilly. She couldn't schedule anything for three days so, yes...I did end up those three days in the hospital. Thanks for that Custom Control Associates: I'll forward the bill. When they finally booked a day, they also booked a window of time the service people would show up. The window was 1pm - 5pm. At 5:30 I called. Answering machine (not Voice mail). When I called at 6pm, answering machine (not voice mail). When I called at 6:30pm, answering machine (not a voice mail). I was being screened out as I was getting angrier and angrier and Lilly just, I suppose, didn't want to deal with me. Finally, around 6:45pm, when I was getting ready to leave for the hospital again, two technicians arrived. They climbed on the roof to check our AC unit. They were up there 5 minutes before coming back down and telling me they needed to order a part and wouldn't be back for 3, maybe 4 days. Unacceptable. However, it was too late to start this process over with another company, so mad, I let it go for a minute. Then, I did some research on YouTube. I watched a video, climbed up on my roof and fixed my own air-conditioning in 30 minutes by washing away the accumulated mud and changing out the oil. THEY KEPT ME IN THE HOSPITAL. THEY KEPT ME WAITING THE DAY OF SERVICE. THEY LIED ABOUT NEEDING A PART and HENCE...WERE RUNNING ONE BIG SCAM! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.Â Custom Controls Associates: YOU'LL WAIT. THEY DON'T CARE. THEY WILL LIE. THE COMPANY IS RUNNING A SCAM! CALL SOMEONE ELSE. ANYONE Else or do like I did, and fix it yourself!",51639,1831,1832,1,"There should be negative star ratings for this contractor.

The company has not met any of their 'stated' timelines, they have not produced a quality product and refuse to provide a completion date. I have had to extend the construction loan twice, and pay penalties on the loan, due to the lack of completion. They broke ground in September 2017 and as of now, cannot provide a completion date even though they provided a statement that the 'process' would be completed approximately 8 weeks after the cabinets were installed. That was done at the end of May 2018, and it has now been 14 weeks. Getting anything done is like pulling teeth. Communication with the owner and his contractor, Jay Bains, does not happen unless you instigate, via email, and insist on a reply back. They will not install or make arrangements for utilities, you should not expect that they will do that for you. Do not believe that they will complete any build within their advertised time line of 30 weeks. Expect to have to review all of their work, before completion, and provide them with numerous lists of items to be addressed. My current list has been with them since June 2018, and I keep adding to it. Expect to hear, from Mr Bains, the 'you should just live with...' any defect you find and that the repair or fix would be worse than what you have. I will be issuing a complaint with the contractors board, against the company and Mr Bains, for false advertising, poor construction quality and failure to meet expected timelines.

I believe they are disorganized and fraudulent in the way they deal with their clients. Here is why.1. I purchased my building, through a broker, quickly after he let me know that the prices of steel would be going up, and if I locked it in they would honor the prices. So, I signed the contract and sent in the deposit.2. When it came time for the building to be put in, California All Steel told me that the contract I have for the building and the plans from the engineer do not match and I owe them more money than my contract said.3. I spoke with both, the manager and the broker who wrote up the contract. The broker was trying to work with both of us and make sure the contract was honored, and the manager at California All Steel told both of us they would agree to reducing the amount they told me that I owed them for the extra beams, etc. from $4,500 to $3,600.4. I asked them to finance that remainder, so that I could just pay what was on the contract and pay the rest over time.5. They said no, but I could use the finance company they are affiliated with.6. I applied, was accepted and told them to send the new contract.7. Instead of $3,600 more, the contract said I was to pay $7,200 more (even more than they originally quoted above) because the cost of everything was higher than in my original contract.Â 8. I sent that to my broker.9. I talked to the manager who said she would just charge the $3.600 more and she said she had to get approval from above her.10. The manager of California All Steel told my broker that I had three days to accept the $3,600 more deal they offered (which they never told me). Regardless, I did accept within three business days.11. Several days later, after my broker called them multiple times, they sent me a revised contract that gave me a discount, but it was a discount on the new price they worked up, with all new prices. This was approximately $5,700 more than what my contract says.In addition to this, California All Steel tried to get the numbers from the finance company for payment PRIOR to sending me the contract. The finance company told me specifically not to give that out to anyone until I was ready to pay.What it seems like to me is that after I had financing for more than the cost of the new prices, California All Steel believed they had me over a barrel (because my permits are for exactly what I was ordering from them - via the engineer's plans). It also seems they wanted to cheat me and get paid before they put in the building.Why did they want to get the payment information prior to me signing the contracts?Why was there no communication between the engineer and the manufacturer, indicating the plans needed more support?Â During the process of getting a permit, they had months to discover the plans and the pricing were off, and let me know that.I don't think this is a company anyone should have to deal with. I highly recommend you go with another company!

I had higher expectations for what used to be a nice restaurant.",51670,1866,1867,2,"We have a Mother's Day reservation, took use 30 mins to be seated understandable it's busy, they got our order, an hour after we got our food, understandable they are busy, we got our crap ehh food.

My wife like this place but she told me we will never come back to this place.",51671,1867,1868,2,Made reservations and came 20 min early. Over hour latter still not seated.

They no longer have popular bran muffins and rain/carrot bread which used to be put on the table with entrees. Not even available from bakery. Two of three entrees DISAPPOINTED.

However, lately I've noticed a decrease in the quality of food AND customer service. Every time I visit, I notice there is someone new who hasn't been properly trained due to there lack of knowledge about the menu and customer service skills. I'm assuming this has to do with new management because:1. Â I've been visiting this location ever since they've opened and I've never had this issue Â 2. Â because I have witness the manger yelling at one of the employees after she accidentally spilled some food on a customer (who was totally understanding about the situation) the girl was obviously sorry and had tears in her eyes. However, the manager was completely unemphatic towards the girl and was more concerned about the ""waste of product"".Â I understood her concern for the waste of product but as a manger you have to be able to know the proper time to discuss those issues in private. Because! it's a total mood killer when you're enjoying your food with your family.",51674,1870,1871,1,"If I had the option to give no stars I would. I had gone in for lunch on May 3 and ordered a chicken shawarma. The food was great, no complaints. BUT what drove me to write this complaint is that Lisa who took my order was so rude. I couldn't pronounce ""shawarma"" and she ""corrected"" me on how to pronounce it. I'm not sure if she was in a rush or something but she was so short with me and seemed as if it was towards the end of her shift and was ready to leave. I had then asked to speak to a manager to let them know of her customer service so they can work on it but that is when she informed me she was the manager. I do not know how this girl is manager, she is rude and inconsiderate.

Â For this price point is an establishment I expect much better customer service and response to issues.Server was totally flat and seemed annoyed to be working. Â This was at time of drink order. Even my 12 year old daughter commented that she was rude and didn't want to ask her for more to drink. Â  She never came to refill drinks and when asked to refill one she never offered to refill the other people in party. Â We were a party of 12 and asked at the start to split the check 50/50. Â The checks came split she put wrong items on the checks specified. Â We decided to not deal with asking her to change. Â I provided her my card for the amount on the check/ bill she gave. Â When it was returned for me to sign she ran the amount for an increased amount than the original bill stated. Â I asked her to which she said ""Oh yeah, I'm off today and noticed I didn't put something on your check. Â So I added it and told my manager."" Â I indicated to her that she should not have run my card without informing me first and secondly I shouldn't be the one to ask. Â Her response was ""I'm off today. Â I'll get my manager."" Â The manager comes over and says ""You wanted to see me?"" Â I communicated to her my concern about the bill and how it was run.

Not sure what kind of meat was served to both myself and wife. The textures didn't even look the same. One was like a hot dog shaped piece of meat the other was just like a pork chop.

By the time they came with the cheese my burger was cold and my wife was basically done eating. Â Told me I wouldn't be charged for the messed up burger. How generous of them.

Before us he calls out another party of two. Two minutes later they say your table is ready. So we walk in and they take us allllll the way thru the restaurant where along the wall there are 3 maybe 4 booths for probably four people or less. Then a smaller booth for two and another booth for 4 or less. Now mind you we walked all through the restaurant where we passed table after empty table to get to this area of the restaurant. People who have eaten here before know this area as this is where they put families with children - not that there were any but that's the location they tried to seat us in or around. So the young lady says here you go and points to the booth for two and I ask her can we get this booth instead which was the larger one. She turns to me and says ""well"" and I say ""well what ? So I say just forget about this and start to leave and I'm saying and pointing ""That couple is in a big booth, point to another saying ""that couple is in a booth also"" and walk out with my grandaughter.

His remarks were curt and disrespectful. Totally disinterested in his job, this was the first impression, then you take a breath of air and the place smells like the urinal drains into the dining room. We left and went to the Marie Callender's. It may be a little bland however the atmosphere is pleasant along with the staff. I hope the management reads this, the host should be removed.

I didn't expect this since we had been here a few time before. To start, we came in and they told us there was a large group so the wait would be 1-2 hours. So we went to the bar area. So we sat and waited 20 mins for someone to serve us. Understanding Â of the large group I didn't take it bad so we continued on with our meal. Next took our server another 20 mins for our cocktail which I that I could not understand since the bar was right next to us. Another 20 for waters as well. So we had a round of cocktail and asked for another. My wife's cosmo did not have vodka in it but tequila. Instead of an apology, waitress and staff were just saying it was because of this and that instead of remaking the drink and apologizing for it. At the emd of our meal they charge my dirty martini with 2 different prices. All in all. Horrible dinner. So many negatives. A very unsatisfied customer here.",51686,1883,1884,2,"I wanted cow and Brussels sprouts. Â Black Angus has both. Â Big mistake this time. (Small mistake last time. Â So stayed away a few months hoping things would improve. They have not.)Wow. How the mighty have fallen.Â This used to be a Fresno weekend dinner hot spot, but it's been a while. Â Upon entry, we are still greeted with the odor of mildew. Inescapable and unmistakable mildew. Broken pipe or leaky roof, it's been over a year and they can't get rid of that smell. Or won't fix the leak. Â IDK, but it's nauseating. They have multiple air fresheners hidden around, so your dinner is punctuated with either overwhelming mildew or overwhelming Moroccan Bazaar. Trigger alert warning to those with sensitivities, allergies, or asthma. Ugh. But, Brussels sprouts.Â Although every table in sight is set and empty, the hostess had both our party of 4 and the party of 2 ahead wait a few minutes to be seated. She was not terribly welcoming for a hostess, although she did go through the scripted motions of asking about our visit while she walked quickly to our booth, even though one of our party was using a walker. Â Maybe she's new.Â Our cheery waitress did not bother to mention that she wouldn't bring the actual Long Island Iced Tea ordered, but some pink cranberry tea concoction instead. (It's okay that they're different. Â But that's a conversation you have BEFORE you bring the beverage. You don't just bring something else.) Â She also took two orders for Brussels sprouts and an order for wedge salad with balsamic dressing, and started a conversation about how everyone was ordering balsamic lately and so she wondered if it was ""a thing"". Â Might be important to note that she didn't offer the dressing options with salad orders and left me guessing at dressing until I picked one they have. Â Okay, but Brussels sprouts.Â A few minutes later she stopped by to tell us her shift was over, lingering weirdly and uncomfortably in the process. Â Then replacement waiter Eric(?) brought a wedge salad with ranch and bleu cheese. Â Upon inquiry, Eric says that they don't have balsamic. Any kind of balsamic. At all.Â So that whole thing was weird when it didn't have to be, thanks to BA staff. Who was fibbing about balsamic salad dressing, and WHY WOULD YOU BOTHER, for Pete's sake? Â No apology for the misunderstanding. Or acknowledgement of any issue, really.Then Eric returns again and brings a menu and says, oh by the way? We have run out of Brussels sprouts. Please pick something else. ""As you can see, we are very bus..."" Eric turns towards the dining room and starts to gesture to an empty room and breaks off-Â ""Er, we were very busy last night and (mumble mumble) ran out of sprouts."" Drops menu, flees before we can ask questions. Â Um. Â By now you've been open 4 hours, Â we've been here an hour, we ordered 30+ minutes ago, and you're just now noticing you're out? Okay, well planned and even better handled, professional restaurant people.Â I was there for the sprouts, so didn't order any replacement. My friend got asparagus. Eric helpfully pointed out that they'd removed both $1 upcharges even though her asparagus was a ""premium"" sidekick Astounding $1 generosity to us for YOUR mistake, thanks so much. Actually found it more insulting that you said it and thought we'd be impressed at a dollar off a $150 check. Â Then he tells us a story of how someone ordered five orders of sprouts last night, as if that's why they ran out. I'm sure that happened, eyeroll.Â Beverage snafu, salad snafu, weird dressing snafu, sprout inventory snafu, customers sufficiently disappointed as to reject replacement offered. Â Requires at minimum a conciliatory tone, recompense for missing item, some additional offer (small discount (more than one dollar)? comp dessert?) for having not provided the customer experience suggested by adverts+menu+staff, plus additional sincere apologies offered at appropriate intervals and opportunities, in recognition that this is not how you usually do business. At least, this is the kind of response to error that happens at reputable establishments. When you've dropped the ball on the customer, you make an extra effort to acknowledge and repair the situation.Â There are ways to handle these issues. This was not the way. Â If this is a franchise, corporate needs to step in because you are tarnishing their midrange casual steakhouse brand. And imagine the difficulty of that.Â We'll skip this Black Angus. I don't like this kind of customer service. Don't like fibs. Don't like my intelligence insulted. Â Hope things improve there.",51687,1884,1885,2,"Came here because my wife said it had good reviews. I brought like 12 dress shirts to get dry cleaned. All the shirts were fine except one, one of my favorites, had some kind of ink stain spread out on the back. I brought the shirt back and they tried but couldn't remove it. So when I talked to the owner about what happens when something gets stained she was very rude, blaming me for the stain, accusing me that I knew of the stain before I brought it in. How dare she!

Oh well can't win them all.",51688,1885,1886,1,Don't I repeat DON'T get your alterations done here they are overly priced and you don't get what you want mainly because of the language barrier.

They said they don't offer any discounts at all!I went in today and asked if I could have the prices for garments and the attendant acted very annoyed by having to provide me that information. I felt rushed with every further question I asked him. I was trying to determine whether or not I was going to continue taking my laundry here. They made my decision very easy!Â They just lost a big chunk of money for having a bad attitude!,51691,1888,1889,2,On 1/17/18 I took I'm my royal blue dress shirt and a grey vest. Â The shirt was dirt from neck normal nothing exaggerated. I asked for that part to look clean nothing else was wrong with my shirt or vest. Â Well first they told me it would be ready by 2:00 pm since I paid for rush cleaning. Well when I went to pick up they only rushed done item and couldn't find the other. Â  Finally when they called me to pick up at 4:00pm Â I saw they neck on shirt and it was faded. This is a week old shirt. Â I asked why it was faded they said. Because of my sweat faded the shirt. Look at picture. What ever they did screwed up the color. Never again.,51692,1891,1892,0,"Be careful, I took 4 dress shirts to dry clean, and they lost one! still 3 weeks later with nothing by excuses they are stalling to pay for their mistake, it was one if my fav shirts, they had my wife take home another shirt even though she said it was not mine until they could find it? sufice to say we returned the unknown shirt! very unprofessional and outdated system... I will update this if I get some very needed fair customer service.",51693,1893,1894,0,"Not great but probably the only decent place in Fresno to get your clothes dry cleaned.Â My clothes often come back shrunk or faded even though I ask for dry clean only.

I was told to leave it again and that it would be ready in a couple more days. I'm thinking ""sure no problem"". Following Monday comes and finally receive a call for pick up. Went to pick it up later that afternoon and was told that it wasn't ready (seriously?). Next day I call and was told it was ready and I go again to pick it up and was told it wasn't ready. I had to go three attempts for pick up and little did I know it was in the store the whole time. Their system tracking is horrible which causes me to drive over three times within three days.

I walked into this place today to survey the place and check out prices. When I walked in I saw a price list on the wall.

This older Asian man walks out from the back and I ask him if the prices listed are correct because I could barely read the writing penciled in on the 8.5 x 11"" sheet on the wall. The man, looking suspiciously at me, asks me why I'm there at his place. (I wasn't there to order a pizza!). I let him know I just moved into the area and was looking for a dry cleaner and laundry service. He looks at me again suspiciously and tells me there are other places that I can go to that are cheaper like the 99 cents dry cleaner down the street. (That was rude, you jerk!) All I was asking for was the pricing. So I asked him again if the Â pricing listed on the sheet is correct. He tells me, ""It depends."" I asked him, what does it depend on? He tells me that my shirts are too big and he would charge me $4.50 per dress shirt as he walks away from me back into the shop. That's double than what usually pay. I looked at him in amazement and thought to myself what an idiot this Mr Miagi jerk is and just walked out. Am I pissed? Yup! Will I ever come back to this place again? Absolutely NOT! Should you?

Okay First, she should have kindly told us that or had a sign up about the amount of soap to use. My grandmother and I could not even wash in peace, her and her husband had bad attitudes and customer service as a whole. We would have left if we had not already started the wash. And when we were finally leaving, we had a lot to load in the car. The lady who works there ran out the wash house to snatch the laundry carts away before we can bring them back in.

Â  THEY ARE THE WORST. Â Please note that CRDN is a franchise business and this review applies only to CRDN of Central California, with locations in Fresno and Carmel, CA. Â This company destroyed many items and then denied any responsibility for the damage to my items. Â  I had photographic proof for many items that were damaged, having taken pictures for a post fire inventory. Â  The owner, a Ryan Hanson called me after weeks of me leaving messages and hearing nothing back. Â  There was no apology, no admission of responsibility, he appeared not to care one bit at how much distress this had caused me, especially since some items that were destroyed were of huge sentimental value, such as blanket used by our son while he was dying of bone cancer. Â  It took me nearly three months to get a response from CRDN of Central California. Â  And in the end all of the damaged items were Â deemed unsalvageable and my insurance ended up reimbursing me for them, which I did not want them to do. Â  I wanted CRDN to take responsibility for what they had done.The long version:On July 22, 2016 a wildfire started in a remote section of Northern Big Sur, CA. Â  Four days later that fire, known as the Soberanes Fire burned to the back of our house. Â  I am volunteer firefighter here, in an all volunteer department and after four days with out sleep, I worked all night to defend our house, finally spraying it with a gel that prevented it from burning before leaving and hoping it would survive. Â  That night I worked harder than I had ever worked in my life. Â  I slept for 15 hours and when I woke, I called my fire chief to find out if my house had survived, and it had, thanks to my work and that of a Calfire crew.Though the house was saved, we had severe smoke and ash damaged. Â Our house is a typical Big Sur cabin style house and living in a place where it never gets too cold or hot, well it is not sealed that well and there was a 1/16 inch coating of ash on everything and when I walked in the next day, the smoke was so thick I could not see 15 feet in front of me.All of our textiles where thick with the smell of smoke. Â We hired one company to clean the interior of the house and they brought along a rep from CRDN of Central California. Â The rep was super friendly and positive.Â So I decided to use them. Â My items were suppose be cleaned and returned within two weeks tops and the rep said probably within one week. Â  It ended up taking over six weeks. Â  When they were returned I was very excited, as this was the bulk of our clothing, having only evacuated a few outfits, which we were pretty sick of wearing. Â  We were still living in a rental house as our home was still in the process of being cleaned and repaired from the fire damage.When I started opening boxes my heart sank. Â  I found that they had ruined many items. Â Many items had holes in them, some were torn, others had scorch marks. Â  Sweaters were hung on wire hangers and the shoulders were stretched beyond repair often with holes in them where the hanger dug through the knit material. Â  I found that our rugs, while being returned in plastic bags, had not been cleaned at all and still contained ash. Â Things were shrunk, things that were dry clean only had been washed. Â About 25% of our items were ruined.I reported all of this to our rep and he was at first all positive about making it right. Â He picked up the rugs, but when he did this he started to change his attitude. Â  He went from making it right to telling me that our stuff was in bad shape when they picked it up, that it was old, that is was not their fault. Â  In essence he started to blame me. Â  It was awful. Â He then stopped returning calls. Â  He quit or so I was told and after 5 weeks a new rep contacted me. Â  She came out and took pictures and said she was sorry that all of this had happened and she would get a resolution for me within a week. Â I think she truly believed that she would be able to do that.It took another 3-4 weeks before I finally heard from the owner of CRDN of Central California, Randy Hansen. Â He made a deal with my insurance company, CRDN sent over a list of items that were unsalvageable and my insurance company would send me a check for them. Â  I told him I did not want them to pay, that CRDN was responsible. Â He interrupted me and told me that there would be no conversation about this, this is what is happening. Â  He was arrogant, rude, unfriendly and appeared to be completely uncaring as to what I had been through and contemptuous of me.Â I am writing this in hopes of saving others from the horrible experience we had. Â While our insurance compensated us for most of the loss, there is no way to repair or put a price on something like the blanket your dying child used.To me it appears that this franchise and it's owners care about only one thing, money.

Â Most of the lounge was taken up by a private party, they should have just closed the whole thing.

Â I realize as part of the hotel they probably need to have a section open for guests but it was really annoying and give the location to easy to find another place to walk to.The worst part was the bartender didn't know how to make a martini, she took out her phone to google it, no joke.

Â my friend got a rum spirit-forward one that he didnt enjoy - it also came with a giant leaf of something aromatic in it. generally dont like leafy garnishes in my cocktails. Â my second mezcal drink wasnt as good - but def more spirit forward like i had requested. Â and then we ended the evening with negroni's - perfectly easy to make right? wrong. these were not delicious. i can see how butterfly lounge could appeal to people - you walk in, park yourself, tell them what flavors you enjoy and the liquor of choice, and a perfectly tailored cocktail should magically appear. the operative word though is - should. meeps! i'll probably not return for a while.",51708,1911,1912,2,"I really wanted to give this place a better review, but just can't...

It was time to reintroduce the beach to Guinness, my deserved and devoted companion. I carefully chose to reserve room at the best reviewed of the four motel options for my partner, myself and companion dog to nest in, The Ocean Park Motel. After speaking with Chester, at the front desk, Â a two room suite seemed perfectly suited to the needs of we three. It was somewhat costly for me but worth the $165 per night to secure a pleasant accomodation from Sun-Wed.Just after check-in time, we arrived at the motel, fresh of the L train, toting four days of luggage and my elated to smell the fresh sea aire, doggie, Guinness. I felt like we were on a mini-retreat. Our excitement was shattered however, in moments after our arrival. Chester informed us that the plumbing had ""gone out"" in the two room + bathroom suite that we had reserved. I was shocked and asked why he didn't try to call and let me know so that we could have avoided the trek over and made other plans. He said, ""Oh, I just found out about this problem myself about an hour ago."" I said, surely there must be another type of room we could occupy for the four nights? He said again, ""oh no, we are all booked up for the next four nights."" He may has well of turned over a big ""closed"" sign in our faces because it was clear there was nothing he was willing to do to accomodate us or realize our plight. Needless to say, I ended up in tears of sadness and frustration because of the preparation involved and the enthusiasm that needed to be squashed and reevaluated. I cannot say how much I felt as though he did not like the outfit I was wearing, if it was that he prejudged my service dog to be bad because he is a bigger breed, if my breath smelled bad or just what I had done in such a quick period of time that could have rubbed him so wrong?

No problem. When we checked in, the room we were assigned was in the annex building around the corner in the alley. We opened the door of the building and the smell of Clorox was so strong it made my eyes water and my throat close up. Fortunately, the (barred) windows in the room opened and there was a ceiling fan so we were able to somewhat air out the room while we went out to eat.The room itself was very sparse, no carpeting like in the main building rooms and the floor was sticky. I had forgotten to bring any sort of indoor footwear so I had to wear socks at all times my feet were on the floor. My white socks ended up almost black after a short time. There was also no sink or even a mirror in the room, nor was there a separate ""water closet"" outside of the shared bathroom. So, when someone was taking a shower you just had to hold it or go to the main hotel to relieve yourself.As for the shared bathroom, there was one bathmat for the entire floor (rather than each room having their own that you could take with you when you showered) which is really gross. The floor was usually wet and the bathmat ended up soaked in a pile in the corner. I saw it this way twice but I'm not sure if it was the same mat left more than one day or if it was a different mat that ended up there two days in a row. I think it might have been the former because there was a glass on top of a cabinet the day we checked in, along with a small bar of soap, a toothbrush and a small tube of toothpaste on a windowsill that never moved the 3 days we were there. I finally looked in the glass and it had something crusted on the bottom. Who knows how long it had been sitting there. There was also hair stuck to the wall right next to the sink that I had to look at every time I brushed my teeth. I don't believe the bathroom is thoroughly cleaned on any kind of regular basis.The breakfast was surprisingly good with very good coffee, fresh fruit bowl, yogurt & granola, a variety of cereals, bagels & pastries, juice and meat and cheese platter.Â The staff was friendly and when I voiced my complaints about the state of the annex building they refunded me 10% of my stay.

It looked like a storage room with some office chairs thrown in the corner. The headboard was not even attached to the bed or wall. It just banged around. The bed had to be 20 years old.

Â I am sorry that you did not feel that your experience with us was exceptional, as we strive for that with every stay. Â With regard to your points, we make it very clear that parking can be expensive in downtown San Francisco, but we do have the convenience of valet parking for fee so that you do not have to find a lot (with varying rates and hours of operations) on your own. Â Because of congestion in our area, in can indeed take some time to retrieve a valeted car, although we make abundant attempts to communicate that from the moment that a guest arrives; I hope that that was the case with your stay. Â I will say, I am very sorry that the incorrect vehicle was brought up; because we work with a third party for our valet needs, there may have been a breakdown in communication, but that should never have affected you, so I am deeply sorry that that was the case, which is why the parking fee was waived. Â San Francisco was peculiarly warm during your stay and we do have multiple fans in each room as a contingency for unexpectedly warm days; we also have additional fans that we could have brought to the room upon request. Â We do not advertise our rooms as having mini fridges, so I am sorry that you had expected one; while we have a handful that are available upon request, I am happy to say that our rooms will be undergoing an update later this year (much like the bathrooms had just a few months ago) which will indeed bring mini fridges to all of the rooms.I am sad to know that you did not try our complimentary breakfast or wine and cheese reception, as guests thoroughly enjoy both of these included amenities; they are two of the features that distinguishes us.I hope that when you are traveling to San Francisco again, that you give us another try so that you can experience the exception service that is normally our hallmark.Thank you again.Best regards,Ramon SerranoGeneral Manager""MY UPDATE (since you can't respond to comments?):Bottom line: don't book solely based on reviews. You need to read their website regarding parking (because like I said - don't even bother with a car, just take a taxi!).

When in actuality, this was a special, rare occasion and we would have cancelled our reservation, had we not been locked in to a prepaid, non-refundable rate.Another really sad part that you should all consider before staying here-- most of the protesters were elders and/or appeared to most likely be from other countries or POC... is Marriott a company that takes advantage of immigrants, POC and elders? I mean it must be pretty bad if that many people are protesting, nationwide. Think about where you want to spend your hard earned money and more importantly WHO you want to give it to.If Marriott truly does pay their employees unfair wages, we are unlikely to stay at any affiliated hotels, such as St. Regis, again. Especially for the price we paid. Might as well go to the Ritz or Four Seasons... their employees aren't protesting. Or stick with good ole Hilton.",51730,1934,1935,0,"Ugh. I LOVED this hotel. Everything about it was fabulous. Between the rooms and the staff, it was great.Â Well, except the fact that they underpay their staff. All days in San Fran were accompanied by protests at every Marriott in the area asking for fair, living wages. If I had not been there for a conference that left the entire city closed down, I might have even changed hotels.Â Although the st. Regis did everything they could to accommodate me as a guest during the protests, they really should be accommodating the staff that help the hotels run day in and day out.Â Once the protests have concluded, I will happily update my review to discuss the hotel more thoroughly, for now, #UnionStrong!",51731,1935,1936,2,"I am so confused by the amazing reviews this place has received. My company has this listed as a preferred hotel ((insert side-eye)). The location is good but the rooms are crap! Old and smelly, super dirty carpets, chipped tile on the shower floor, my bed was dented in and on a slope...not comfortable. Someone clearly has not informed the hotel management that it is 2019 because this place is stuck in the 60's and thats probably the last time the carpets were shampooed. I felt like I had itchy skin my entire stay. The rooms look nothing like the photos. It was all just so gross! HOWEVER, the front desk staff was super kind and professional. The restaurant is just ok. I would pass on this place!",51732,1936,1937,1,If I could I would give no star I would. Hands down worst experience from a hotel I have ever experienced. If I wanted to go into it nahib is not qualified to be working night audit or Hotel Abri should be more concerned with how they direct there employees on how they treat their costumers. When there is a single guest on the room reservation and they show up with one other guest that isn't on the reservation I feel they should be able to accommodate that guest and let them up to the room... apparently not at Hotel Abri. Completely unorthodox on how I have experienced the hospitality industry. Growing up in Napa in the hospitality business I feel Hotel Abri has much to learn about costumer service and hospitality. That being said they probably won't. On top of it I felt like I was treated biased based on my age... despite being young I travel more than most and use Airbnb every month. Take a look at my ratings and you will see my track record with hotels and Airbnb is flawless. I am a seasoned hotel user and Hotel Abri is THE ABSOLUTE WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED AT. They even refused to give me copy's of receipts upon checkout.... I could keep going but I'll just stop since I would rather not devote more of my time and energy to this pathetic hotel.... and btw the restaurant and rooms are a sad and depressing place to start:/,51733,1937,1938,1,"I had an absolutely horrible stay here. While the reviews look good, ladies, if you're traveling for work and want to feel like you're at a safe hotel where your room number won't be given out to strangers and you stuff won't be stolen, DON'T STAY AT HOTEL ABRI.I had a two night stay for a work conference. The first night, I got back late and all three of my key cards would not work. I had to call the front desk and they told me I was probably ""inserting the card the wrong way."" I was really tired and shocked that I had to wait so long to get access to my room.The second night, I took a Lyft line back with other conference goers that I did not know. One of them asked to charge their phone in the lobby since it was dead and I said sure. I went up to my room and called it a night since I had early morning meetings. When I checked out, they said that I had a charge on my room for a bottle of wine, which I did not buy. I asked if someone else had bought it on my account and they said yes but they had to know my room number to charge it. I had not given out my room number, only my first name, so that means that the front desk person had given a COMPLETE STRANGER my room number and allowed them to charge whatever they wanted to my room. I felt really creeped out and unsafe.Lastly, just a few hours after checking out I realized I had left an expensive tailored leather jacket that was a gift from a friend hanging in the closet. I called the front desk on Friday late afternoon and asked them if it had turned up and if someone could check the closet. Their reply? ""It's not on the log and we have to ask house keeping but they're gone for the day."" I asked if they could just check the room and they said they had forwarded my number and housekeeping would call back. Well, I called the next morning on Saturday morning after the next guest had already checked in. The head of housekeeping said ""it wasn't on her log"" and refused to confirm the the room had been physically checked and additionally refused to go check it. She said to call back when the guest had checked out. Well, I called on at 4pm on Saturday and guess what? They told me it still ""wasn't on the log"" and refused to check to closet because ""another guest had checked in."" At this point I was getting Â irritated because it shouldn't take two days to check a closet. I repeatedly asked if they could physically go check the closet and she said she would let the front desk ""know"" about my request.On Sunday I got a call in the afternoon from the front desk. They told me that the jacket still wasn't on the log and the the head of housekeeping had (finally) checked the room and it wasn't there. Well, of course it wouldn't be there because it's been three days! I asked if the head housekeeping had physically checked on Friday after I had checked out and he said yes, she had checked after the room had been cleaned and again on Sunday. I was doubtful that the room had been actually checked by the head of housekeeping because I asked her point blank and she wouldn't say if she checked the room. I then asked if they have the record of who cleaned the room because if that's the case, then my jacket was most likely taken by someone on the house keeping staff. The other very likely scenario is it was taken by the next guest. The man said there was NO RECORD of who cleans the individual rooms, which I am also highly doubtful of.So, if you want to stay somewhere that doesn't care about your safety and personal belongings, definitely stay here. Otherwise, stay at the Parc 55 or Hotel Fusion across the street.Update: The hotel manager contacted me and claims that the charge was simply a ""clerical error."" I recommended they review the footage of the man taking the bottle of wine and talking to the staff in order to purchase it. In addition, the hotel manager refuses to take responsibility for the fact that her staff was negligent in physically checking the closet for the jacket.",51734,1938,1939,1,"What a terrible disappointment and substandard hotel this is in every respect.

We didn't behave in any way that was inappropriate, we just inquired if they could turn on the light so that I can see where it is, they refused to turn it on. Also, since there are cameras everywhere, I asked if we could see the video footage of when my jacket got stolen, they refused to cooperate. It appears to me that this place doesn't care at all about their customers or retaining the few good people who go to this place. I am quite disappointed.

Unfortunately, my stay there was not positive.I stayed in room 302. This room faces a light well, the view being into windows of other rooms and an adjacent apartment building. There is no ventilation in this room and it is thus airless and stuffy. The only way to get air is to open the windows. In doing so, you are now subject to non-stop noise from other rooms, i.e. cell phones ringing/being answered at all hours, sexual relations, conversations, baby crying, toilets flushing, TV, etc. The roller shade on the window was non-functional with light coming into the room an issue all night. Air quality - around 4 a.m. fetid odors of burning food filled the room and were still present when I checked out at 9 a.m. All of this made for a miserable night and a less than refreshed sense of being for the work day ahead.Â I have read similar reviews on other forums such as trip advisor. It seems that the quality of your experience at this hotel depends on what room you get. It appears that if you can afford an upper floor, outward facing suite w/view the reviews are positive.

I contacted the hotel manager with this feedback and did not receive a response, hence my review here. Potential customers need to know that a ""deluxe queen"" room (what I had) was a miserable room to spend a night in. Would hate to have a less ""deluxe' room.Management needs to come clean on the reality of their rooms, i.e. rooms facing a light well, no attached bath, etc. in their online descriptions and when booking so that the customer can decide if these limitations are worth the price.

I typically do not write reviews, unless I'm displeased with service. Tonight I was called and approached twice for a noise complaint. The 1st time I was called at 6:45PM that there was too much noise coming from my room. Let alone I am staying by myself and was speaking on the phone with my wife and daughter, because a family member passed away. Secondly, I went out to pick up food, came back at 8:30PM, and was immediately approached by 2 gentlemen at my door for a 2nd noise complaint. I opened my door wide and showed them there are no other individuals staying with me. No parties, nothing, and was accused of slamming my door and making too much noise. I'm here for work, nothing else. Based on our conversation, my side was not taken into consideration. I was told to be quite, stop the noise, stop slamming doors (never did once), otherwise I would be kicked out. My side was not taken into consideration, let alone I did nothing wrong.

It sure wasn't coming from mine. Never staying at a Hyatt again just for a decent deal, ever again. Hyatt, you should approach situations hearing both side of the story.

I came across this hotel and was under the impression that the following would have been included and my total for the room (excluding tax and service fees) would have been $157/night. I even looked through the website and hotel confirmation email just to double check if these amenities were included, and they both said that they were. However, this was not the case. First of all, there was no onsite parking. We were told to park in a third party parking garage and pay $35/day for self service, and double that amount for valet. In terms of the breakfast, it is only free if you are a club member (which was not originally stated in the website or confirmation email). For everyone else, you are only given a $15 voucher to cover whatever you order for breakfast. My boyfriend and I decided to go ahead and get breakfast from the hotel anyways and just use the $15 voucher towards the buffet. When we found out that the breakfast buffet was $30+/person, we opted for the menu items instead. As soon as we were seated, we were offered coffee. So of course, we assumed the coffee was complimentary and we went ahead and ordered 2 cups. But boy was that a big mistake. We were given the menus after we had already drank our coffee, and to our surprise, a cup of plain, black coffee was $6/cup. At this point, we were already seated and finished our drinks, and we didn't want to be rude and leave. So we decided to just splurge on breakfast and give the food a chance, despite the price. When we thought our breakfast couldn't have been anymore disappointing, we received our food and found that 1 waffle came out to $20, and 2 eggs with about 4 small pieces of potatoes came out to $19. Overall we ended up spending $70+ more than what we were expecting on amenities we thought were already included. If I would've known there was no free parking or breakfast, I would not have booked this hotel to begin with.

But it's not quite capitalizing upon it, and I hope that changes.Pros: It's right across from the zoo and right by the beach. The drive to Golden Gate (and Napa/Sonoma!) is fast and easy. The Muni stop is right across the street so public transportation is a breeze. The bright colors of the exterior are charming, and the staff is generally very pleasant. The landscaping in the courtyard is pretty (love that big, old tree!), and there is sufficient parking for guests. The room rates were reasonable. We had a fridge so we could make breakfast at home and keep our costs down a little on vacation.Cons: The suites with two queen beds aren't really big enough for two queen beds. The flower arrangements on the walls made me want to throw things. The bedding is not high quality (which is to be expected, for a motel), but it's also just not attractive. The beds were soft, which hurt my back. The Muni stop means constant background noise for street-facing rooms. They leave the windows open all the time, even when residents close the windows, which felt unsafe to me given the street-level location and number of pedestrians outside -- I would've been upset if anything had gone missing. The bathroom is TINY, and it is impossible to shave your legs in the shower. The kitchen could use some editing to maximize the space, too, because it's tight in there. The pots and pans are terrible.Advice to OPM: Embrace your small size! There are creative storage options that could really maximize your space while retaining its charm. Update your bedspreads with something bright, and lose the wall flower arrangements. Look into some inexpensive wall art that doesn't eat into the room space instead! Does every room need a dresser if the rooms are as small as they are? Swap out the queen bed in the main room for a futon or pull-out couch so there is some walking space when no one is sleeping.

At least, you know what you are purchasing, as you can see it and not rely on some employee in a warehouse to label items correctly. My lesson was learned and I feel it necessary to pass on this information to other people.Â Also, the clothes are priced too high without coupon codes and you can buy new clothes at stores for cheaper, especially during sales and with store coupons. It's a bit ridiculous to sell used clothes for the same price as department stores. Another con is the fact that they don't give you a return label to return clothes or a bag to send them back in, which can cause issues for some customers, who Swap.com expects to just print out a label.

I feel cheated and at lost for what to do.",61803,2014,2015,2,I ordered 2 dresses that were alike except for different colors with black accents. One for me and one for my mother in law. When I got them they were all black with the different colors on a very small part of the sleeves. They say satisfaction guaranteed and I even asked over the phone because of a previous order they had made me think was my fault that if I got something I didn't order would they take it back and pay shipping and they assured me they would. I sure enough this happened but after saying they would give me a refund if I paid the shipping to CA which is the cost of one of the dresses I sent an email showing how it was their fault they stopped responding and took the dresses off of the site so when I called about my return slip they had a new excuse saying I chose all black which is completely not true and I even have the proof of that. The choices were white and black the accent colors which I chose and the title of the dresses are the colors I wanted with black or white as accent choices not the entire dress. I have filed a refund from my bank and with the BBB. i believe this company does these things on a regular basis which is sad because muslim women need a place to buy clothes and they are taking advantage of us.

I reluctantly canceled my subscription because of the perversity of their pricing--it actually costs significantly more to return an item you don't want than to keep it. They give a ""keep everything"" discount which exceeds the price of several of the individual items. Return it, you lose the discount and they charge more overall than if you had kept it. I suppose I could just donate the item to Goodwill or something, but the whole concept is so wasteful that I quit.",61807,2019,2020,2,"Stitch fix generally has stylish clothes and accessories. However the quality is poor for the price. After washing many of the pieces they developed a very shabby looking appearance. Also, with almost every single one of my fixes I had an article of clothing tear or rip after the first time I wore it. The customer service was good though. They would either send a replacement or credit my account. There is one other thing that bothered me. After trying about 17 fixes over the last few years I had finally found the best stylist. But then they gave me another one that was really bad so I ended up sending everything back. That was the last straw for me. It is a good model, especially for busy women but again the quality needs work.",61808,2020,2021,2,"Stitich Fix was great the first 6 months, but they stopped trying after that.

Again, great for a few months, but if Stitich Fix wants to keep customers they need to start trying a little hard to listen to their customers.",61809,2021,2022,1,Worst company I have ever ordered from. I have continuously given chances and picked at least 1 thing in my box just to waive the $20 fee. After my last box I am so done!! I shouldnÂ’t pay a stylist that doesnÂ’t even fulfill my requests.

Before that I requested scalloped hemmed dresses. Did not receive any... my products are never what is requested. My Â“stylistÂ” doesnt care about my care about my.

I have no use for this super long tie and wanted to return it for credit for the amount that I paid , I would have applied that credit and paid extra money for the regular tie I wanted. Their rep wouldnÂ’t listen and created a loose loose situation.. I lost the money I spent on the the tie because they didnÂ’t honor their commitment to accept returns much less free returns. They lost a customer who would have continued to buy ties for my friends and clients and they lost future clients that I would have referred to them.. So they lost a very good customer. .Â Beware!

I gave 2 stars instead of 1 as a courtesy because I've ordered from them in the past without issue.",61814,2027,2028,1,"I was a very loyal customer for almost 2 years, buying ALL my ties and socks from them. Because I liked the quality I decided to opt in for their subscription service. I figured, it says ALL OVER their website that they have such a great return policy, that you can return any item for any reason FOR FREE, so what do I have to lose? As it turns out, buried deep at the end of the legal disclaimer, NOT the return policy section, it says that in fact you CANNOT return anything from the subscription OR be refunded anything. So after I kept receiving things like a little vial of instant coffee (the kind they have in jail, why the F would I want a tie store to send me coffee??) , a cooling wipe in the middle of a polar vortex Ohio winter (the second coldest in my lifetime), I started to rethink the whole thing. The last box I received was FILLED with garbage. A gold leaf plated PLASTIC lapel pin?? Plastic collar stays?? ANOTHER INSTANT COFFEE DRINK?? I decided I wanted my money back. ( it also included a pair of solid aquamarine socks and a black and white polka dot bow tie, nothing even came close to matching). ThatÂ’s when I found out that the website would not process my return. It didnÂ’t say why, just that it couldnÂ’t. So thatÂ’s when I literally read THE ENTIRE legal disclaimer page, from start to finish, and found that in the very last paragraph there are a couple of lines that say they wonÂ’t refund or accept returns for the subscription stuff. No reason, just that they donÂ’t. This PÂ’d me off, because every single purchase I had made up to that point was made with the understanding that I could return it (except the clearance items of course). Their return policy is one of the things they boast about the most, actually. So I called in (you HAVE to call in to cancel, but I did email them TWICE before calling and never got any response, even though it says youÂ’ll get one in 24 hours or less) and when I explained what was happening, the customer service rep basically just said sorry, but that there wasnÂ’t anything that could be done. When I said how they had just charged my card again for the next month of service just 2-3 days prior to my call and I wanted it refunded, he said the best he could do is give me a $20 code. Which, thanks I guess? But what about the other $50 you took from me? This is a total bait and switch. So be aware that they will in fact send you a bunch of useless crap that you will probably hate if you are as dumb as I was when I signed up for the subscription, and that they will not care if youÂ’re not happy with what they sent. In fact, the subscription service isnÂ’t even RAN by ties.com, which they neglect to tell you unless you call in and complain and demand your money back. I considered filing a claim with my credit card company to cancel the payment and refund the money, but instead I just informed the guy that I would just never shop there again. He didnÂ’t care. I recommend the tie bar, they have a bigger selection and have better prices. The only reason I didnÂ’t switch sooner is because I BELIEVE IN CUSTOMER LOYALTY. So basically, ties.com will burn you eventually.

I can't trust a company that uses dishonest tactics such as this, and neither should you.UPDATE: In their reply to my oiriginal review (below) they cite their stated policy on price matching. I read that policy before I called them. The simple fact is, they do not honor that policy. Period. Full stop.UPDATE 2 (Response to merchant's 2nd response): All any potential customer has to do is call you to find out that (a) your ""cost"" is always the price you have the item listed for, and (b) as I've said (and as your response illustrates) you don't price match.The fact is, I would have bought the frames as well as future products from you without hesitation had you not had the price matching baloney posted on your website - that dishonest tactic is doing you more harm than good.Finally, I didn't give my name when I called, so how did you know which part of your ""price matching"" policy didn't apply in my case? You're digging yourself deeper with each response.",61857,2070,2071,2,I have been a loyal customer for many years until now. I have purchased at least four pair of glasses all being Ray-Ban. This last pair I have had two years and the lens started peeling. They are progressive without any scratch coating applied. I called them to see if anything could be done and they said no because the warranty ran out. They then said they could give me a 10% discount on my next pair. They were already offering this to anyone who purchases them on line anyway. I am very disappointed with this as I have been as loyal as an old dog to them.. Could they spare it? Really? 10%..

The glasses were late, and there was considerable hassle with the shipping.After reading many reviews of online eyeglass makers, I ordered over the phone with Stephanie, who provided a price match for the frames. She informed me that the glasses should arrive in about two weeks via two day shipping.I contacted them at two weeks less one day, since I had not yet received a shipping notification and tracking number. Linda responded and said the glasses should ship out that day, or possibly, the next day. This was on a Thursday, and I received no shipping notification on either Thursday or Friday.I called on Monday and spoke with Tracy. She stated that the glasses would ship out on Tuesday. After considerable back and forth, she finally agreed to find out why they hadn't shipped out the previous week, as promised. It turned out that one of the lenses had been broken while being made. She assured me, however, that they would ship out on Tuesday. I asked for expedited shipping. She agreed to two day shipping. I explained that I already had two day shipping. It turned out I had seven day shipping.Â If I had stuck it out with their delayed lens making and delivery, I would have received the glasses the following Tuesday, maybe, a full three and a half weeks after I ordered -- 1.5 weeks late.I asked for overnight shipping, since the glasses were already late. Tracy stated that this could not be done since her supervisor had already gone for the day; this was at 3 pm EST. She stated that I should just cancel my order since I did not seem satisfied. I replied that I found it strange there was no one there who could approve overnight shipping. She, again, repeated that I should just cancel my order and then put me on hold. When she came back, she said that the glasses would be done that day, Monday, but that they could not do the overnight shipping. I asked, again, for overnight shipping since the order was late, and she repeated, yet again, that I should just cancel my order, that they were not making any money on my order. Plus I should have known, she said, that the order might take a while due to my high prescription. (When I placed my order with Stephanie, there was no mention of potential problems with my prescription). Tracy, again, put me on hold, and when she came back, she stated they could do overnight shipping. She then put me on hold again to check that the person working on my glasses would continue to do so, because apparently in the back and forth between the lab and herself, some uncertainty was created regarding whether the lab wanted to continue making my glasses.This entire exchange took some time, and it was very unsatisfactory. Tracy's attitude and statements conveyed that I was extremely lucky that SimplyEyeglasses.com agreed to make my glasses. I asked for an email address for Tracy's supervisor. I received an email address for Cindy, to whom I sent an email detailing the exchange. It's been two weeks, and I have not received a response.Â The glasses themselves are fine, which is the reason for the two stars rather than a single star. But their customer service is very poor. They should have provided more realistic timing in the first place, and once the problem with the broken lens arose, they should have contacted me with an update. Absent an update, they should have been more willing to nail down the reasons for the continuing delay and to immediately speed up the making of the glasses and their delivery. Instead, I had to call them and then got a lot of grief for asking for expedited shipping of an item which was already late.I would not recommend SimplyEyeglasses.com.",61860,2073,2074,0,My glasses were awful.

They never processed it or called me back to explain that they could not process a phone order.

They were only willing to back out the charges, but not offer any sort of resolution to me for what literally ended up being hours of my time chasing down charges from their flawed system. I was told that they are a very small company and they could not afford to waive or reduce charges to address customer complaints.

The allure of beautiful products with a decent price isn't worth it if you never get them.",61951,2174,2175,0,"I originally ordered bags from Paper Mart in 2006. Since I am in Australia, and Paper Mart doesnt send internationally, I sent the bags to a contact in WA to forward to me. Since we were going to be in WA in August, 2018 it was a prime opportunity to purchase a larger order of bags from Paper Mart and bring them back with me at that time.In November 2018, I contacted Paper Mart about my order. As stated at that time, I had not had the opportunity of going through the bags earlier (they were ordered in July) due to some personal issues and only had enough time to count the bags to make sure all was correct. During this, I found some of the Rose coloured bags that were so absolutely terrible, I contacted Paper Mart about those and some missing bags. They refunded me the $5 or so for those bags.Unfortunately, I had been unable to go through the bags fully and repackage them for resale, due to my partnerÂ’s ongoing medical issues. I sell the bags in packs of 4, primarily as bags that people can craft with, so they need to be of good quality. I went through all the bags, and I couldnÂ’t believe what I was seeing. So I contacted Paper Mart TWICE saying essentially what is in this review (including photos of the issues) with no response! no customer service, no trying to make things right. In 2006 the bags were PERFECT. The cutting, stitching and quality was PERFECT. The seams were PERFECT! They were crisp, rightly sized and perfectly shaped. I could just take the bags from them and repackage and away they go. I had absolutely NO losses. The only bags that I could do that with now are the Hearts and Swirls (only losing 3 due to some dark pink being in the wrong spot) and the Daisy ones (only losing 2 due to dark pink ink on the daisy petals). I put the bags aside that were questionable which was very near all of them, revisiting them 2 more times to make sure I wasnÂ’t being pickyÂ…I WASNÂ’T. I spent over 3 hours cutting threads off them, over 2 hours ironing some of them to see if I could match up the seams properly with limited results. ItÂ’s just a shame I canÂ’t attach photos on this review as you would be as appalled as I am. The following are some of the problems:1. Dirt and marks on the bags2. Seams coming apart3. Stitching coming apart4. Not even rectangle5. Sizing different (some up to Â_ inch which on this size bag is noticeable6. Stitching not straight7. Corners square on one side and rounded on the other8. Flimsy organza (a huge variation on the quality in the same pack)9. Twisted ribbon so bad I cant fixI do understand that Paper Mart are unable to check every one (and going on what I received they havenÂ’t checked any) however I have to, as I package in smaller quantities, and just starting to increase my sales makes it even more important. The quality was so good back then that ordered again, thinking that was normal. Now I know it wasnÂ’t. If I had received these back in 2006, I would not have ordered from Paper Mart again. I paid AUD$309.91 for these bags (1560 of them). When I went through them there are 328 bags that I definitely couldnÂ’t use which in itself if over 21% failure rate. In addition there are further Rose bags I canÂ’t use, the Ivory, Light Pink, Silver and Toffee are almost write offs (which is 540 bags), and the rest are questionable except the Lime which appears to be the only really successful colour. So all in all I have about 360 bags out of 1560 that I could actually feel good about onselling. Honestly knowing what I feel receiving them, I can imagine what my customers would feel like receiving them. As it had been over 30 days when I checked them, and due to being in Australia it would be not very cost effective to return them anyway.It may be an issue with their supplier, but it's ultimately Paper Mart's responsibility to stand behind what they are selling. I have essentially handed over a lot of money and nothing much to show for it. It has bought my sales of this product to a standstill and impacted my ability to bring in extra money for my family.

Mind you fedex did not come by til the day after. On top of that, the colors did not match remotely close to what was on the screen. so as soon as i received it i over nighted it back to the store where it was SIGNED AND RECEIVED BY someone in their warehouse, almost a week later and my return is still ""processing""They are quick to take the money but not quick to actually give it back.",61953,2177,2178,2,"We ordered some items essential for our business Nov 26th, by Dec 7th we still didn't have the items.

I received about a 1300$ quote which seemed too good to be true (it was). Anyway, I set up my pickup date in Bloomington, IN for June 16/17. The drivers were a day late on June 18th and arrived at night. Overall not a huge deal but I had to initiate communication with the company to get answers which was aggravating. It wouldn't have been a huge deal with better communication. Anyway, when the foreman assessed my furniture the quote changed to 2300$. I'm going to assume that however this company does quotes is inaccurate because the amount of stuff I had matched closely with what I provided them in advance. At that point I had no choice but to accept and honestly, not a huge deal but kind of annoying. I will say that the movers did a great job wrapping my stuff up carefully so I'll give them a thumbs up on this specific aspect of the move. The real nightmare began soon thereafter. Since I didn't know my destination address in Austin, TX (I was driving down to select an apartment) I had to fill out a Destination Form (something like that) when I got my apartment which was the 24th of June. I was informed I needed to send it again the 27th. Form sent. Now the real nightmare begins. I wait and wait and wait with absolutely no information at all about when my household goods are going to arrive. I GUESS they guarantee it within 21 business days (I may have had a huge oversight at some point) but I distinctly remember thinking it was 3-10 business days when I paid the deposit. Maybe I missed some fine print that doesn't exist somewhere. Anyway I wait with intermittent communications with the company trying to get an idea of when my stuff will arrive. We come up on July 11th when I have to leave for 2 weeks for work. They won't be there by then so I assume I'll be able to get it immediately when I'm back. I return and can't even get in to contact with the dispatcher (I think?). Repeated calls and texts aren't responded to and I finally send an angry email to the company which yielded at least a call from the dispatcher. This goes on for almost three weeks with vague, nonsensical updates. I'm convinced my stuff is either lost or stolen at this point. I was wrestling with these guys for three weeks and alas, the stuff FINALLY arrives on August 11th. There were some obnoxious add-on charges like this BS 'elevator fee' and 'long carry' fee (which were actually on the Delivery Form I signed AFTER my stuff was picked up so I have no choice) which added about 400$ I needed to pay the guy before they offloaded my stuff. On the plus side, nothing was missing or damaged so I guess that's an extremely thin silver lining.Â Overall I think the major issue for me was communication. Trying to get anything from these guys was impossible and stressful. You're in the dark about your stuff and this operation doesn't seem legitimate at all. Just look at the website, it looks like a child made it (shame on me for somehow getting blinded by the amazing initial quote). I would recommend selecting a national carrier with a strong reputation. You get what you pay for and I learned this the hard way. I would not recommend this company to anyone (well, maybe somebody I didn't like). I was in the military for 4+ years and they were able to move my stuff from Korea to upstate NY in exponentially less time than this company AND they provided me a delivery window that they stuck to. Just avoid this company, please.",61973,2199,2200,0,"The reason we are giving one is as we cant give it in a negative or minus star.Let me tell you that this was the most frustrating move I had so far as I keep moving almost every 6 months or a year.Â 1. At the time of booking, they told that they can hold luggage for 30 days whereas Jeremy from Metro relocation threatened me that If i don't take delivery by 7/7, they will not deliver anything in future and he was shouting that storage is not free and he charged me $300 extra and he said that he will not deliver if i don't pay this additional amount. So this entire move costed me 2246 whereas quote was 1946.Â 2. The pick up guys didn't pack anything and they used the same boxes which we prepared with intention of helping them to make it faster. They just packed as it's without proper fulling the box and whey they are about to move 20 boxes, they said they can't accommodate anything more which is really surprising. As you remember, we discussed during the booking that they can adjust 5-10 more boxes as we can't give exact estimate during placing the order. As a result, I had a lot of stuff which I had to dispose off. They told me they wont even take lamps as they were not mentioned in the list. Do i need to inform you about 2000 plus items i own ? Is not that common sense?3. It was subcontracted to some Metro relocation and they are so arrogant, stubborn and impolite to talk to the customer. As per this quote, i was given two days as move-date out of which second day was for buffer for move however I was not informed until Saturday 06/30 that they will move on 2nd day (2nd July). When the lady contacted me on that fateful Saturday, she told that they wont be coming before afternoon on Monday. When I expressed my concern that its late she said that is when they are coming , do you want me to cancel your order ( the tone was of a threat)? That was the start of the constant harassment of us as customers.And on 2nd July, They told that they can come after only late evening so its better let them come on Tuesday. We told that we can not delay the move after two days delay so they turned up at 8:30 pm which is quite late.Â 4. They did not wrapped the glass items and just dumped the stuff like a novice. So that they could charge more money by adding boxes but as they came late at night and were in a hurry to leave they just were not even ready to pick the entire stuff although we told them we will pay extra. This whole move was a harassment we were charged, overcharged, threatened, rudely dealt with at every step.They kept our stuff as a ransom and threatened if we do not get the delivery the time and day of their choice(although the contract had 30 days free storage) and threatened we might have to pick the stuff from Atlanta if we do not take it on Saturday. When we finally arranged they did not even bothered to call us( although was trying to reach them and told them just give us a call when you are 30 min away. Is that asking too much? As they wanted to put waiting charged as well. Looks like robbers and thugs are running this business. They charged us $300 for keeping the stuff for three days although they had in the contract that we can store for 30 days.5. They came to deliver the stuff also at night and when we told that one entire box is missing they said we need to talk to metro relocation which again have subcontracted to some random guys and the truck on which they came didn't belonged to metro. So my stuff changed hands thrice.

I called her (during business hours) to find out that it was in transit but and she apologized again very sincerely (lol) saying that she had just been notified and would file another ""complaint"" because it was unacceptable like she was actually concerned. So after being told that it was in transit and it would be friday or saturday or sunday they just werent sure when they would get to it the driver calls me at 630pm on Friday to let me know there is going to be another $350 charge because they can't pull the semi into the apartment complex and they are going to have to use a shuttle service.

I was never notified of the extra charges by the broker or the trucking company (was only told by my family who helped at pickup location). The customer service was rude and lacked any empathy when it came to discussing the move and services. I called multiple times, weekly, to check and see where my items were and when to expect delivery but was told every time that, ""my items had legally 21 business days to be delivered and they didn't know exact location of my items"". My couch is completely ruined, my dining room chairs and table are extremely scratched and scuffed, as well as miscellaneous items, such as photo frames and glasses, are all broken.

She said I could look up the Pantone colors for exact matching on the scraper mat but that I'd have to trust her about using the darkest charcoal gray they had for the smaller mats. She sent back an email with the new proofs where the scraper mat was all black with our logo, but the smaller mat design hadn't changed. So when I questioned it she said they'd use the darkest gray. I neglected to ask about the resizing when I approved the mat regrettably ""trusting"" they'd be darker with the logo smaller. When the scraper mat came and still had a large gray border (which incidentally wasn't set evenly) and the still too big logo on the smaller mats are barely visible in the too light gray background. Obviously the wrong order was sent to the plant. When I emailed her as such she said the plant needed proof. I sent her pictures, and she emailed back they'd replace the scraper mat with the approved one but that I had the assume responsibility for the smaller mats as I'd approved them after all. I protested, but she sent me a picture of the two different dark grays they use -one of them mine and how they weren't very different after all.

There's no obvious warranty claim process - you just have to email Mobile Fun repeatedly until they cave and send a replacement. They responded AFTER I sicced Whitestone on them.3. Even though it states ""limited lifetime"", Mobile Fun says that means they'll only replace it 3 times, and only within 1 year of purchase.4.

We have never had to provide these documents and we have closed on 3 houses before this one. Every time we turned around there was something new that was needed or that we had to. None of which we were informed about initially. They sent someone to our house to close and she was an hour late. After talking with her it was because the company was late getting her the paperwork. And to add insult to injury they ended up taking out the next months payments from our checking account, still waiting on that to be returned. Good luck if you want to go with these people.

Message de plainteÂ :
On May 22nd I ordered two boxes of red wine from Vivino, to try them out. 
Four different times I received emails saying the delivery ""would take place tomorrow"". Absolutely nothing arrives and I do not receive a call or a note from Vivino or their delivery company.
I call customer support and while they are incredibly patronising, they basically say the problem is with the delivery company and they will call me back when they have spoken with the delivery company (Parcel Force).
I never receive a call back from Vivino Customer Support. I have to chase them.
After 3 weeks I call Vivino Customer Support to cancel the order and request a refund.
A refund is promised - but a week later: absolutely no refund and certainly no delivery.
Poor delivery service, with an indifference that is only exceeded by the patronising Customer Service.",62178,2427,2428,1,"Absolutely the worst customer service!Â Do not order wine from Vivino.I saw several reviews of ""bait and switch"" and I have to agree! This is exactly what happened to me.Â Trust me, they aren't doing this by mistake. The vintage they are sending is much cheaper and NOT what you ordered!Vivino tried to tell me that they can substitute for a different year. There was absolutely nothing on my receipt or packing slip that states this.Â I sent them a copy. (Vivino requested this to show them, as if they don't have the same copy?)Good luck getting in touch with customer service as well. When you finally do, they drag it on forever and it's like pulling teeth for them to do anything to help you.I had to ask for a return label over 4 times and finally had American Express step in and get my money refunded.Â Vivino did absolutely nothing to make the return easy and I received no compensation for my hours of wasted time.

Home office upped the bribe to 100.00 gift card (that's what they called resolving the waste of my day off and ruining two perfect gifts for my friends.Yes i turned down their offer,but also told them social media will hear about this.It is not a question of revenge at all, a company like C&B proved to be unorganized,liars and seem to not care about their customers and that is what I am showing here.",62219,2470,2471,0,"I ordered approx. $1000. in pillows.

IÂ’d only recommend buying this album if you have a very very good quality record player, because mine just skipped through most of the album and I had to return the record.",72223,2475,2476,0,"Replacement item arrived today and playback is just as bad as the first one. We really gave this the benefit of the doubt but were definitely disappointed again. Returning this for a refund. You can see artifacts in almost the same exact location as the previous record. The replacement was plagued with random skipping and distorted audio. Can't stress enough, this record player has absolutely no issues playing the other two sony manufactured records we've purchased. Playback is smooth and effortless with those, while this one you can't even enjoyably listen to. It's unfortunate, but I do not recommend purchasing this particular item. You might have better luck with another batch/ collector's version but two bad ones in a row is not a good sign. You're better off sticking to digital on this one, unless you want it for display only.

My younger sister recently got a record player for her birthday and we're slowly building her collection. She has two other records that are fantastic. Smooth playback, no skipping.
As for this one - terrible skipping, unusable playback. It has minimal to no warping and yet it plays like the most warped piece of vinyl ever. Very disappointed that so many customers on here were right, and the amount of defective products being sent out is honestly inexcusable. I noticed one review mention that even their replacement was defective. I echo that person's statement, and if the replacement I receive is also defective I'll just return this.
We listen to this album on that one music app that starts with an 'S', and it's a great album the whole family enjoys. So it's a real shame if they do not resolve this.",72224,2476,2477,0,"My sister bought this, so I thought I should give it a listen. Is this really the future of pop music?

Was excited to get back to it, but now that I'm a few issues in, just throw it in the trash when it comes. This is a shadow of what it once was. Hardly any fitness and health info now.

Last issue I received was Oct 2018 - cover model was Alexa Chung (who I like) but is not a ""normal"" person to use for fitness inspiration - she is a model! Shape used to have weight loss stories - workouts, and food. Now I literally have ZERO articles I wanted to read 3 months in a row. I'm trying out a true fitness mag - Health or FitnessRx for my next subscription.",72340,2603,2604,2,"Shape used to be such a great magazine. They used to have detailed workout plans for cardio, strength training, and diet that were excellent, creative, and challenging with amazing photography. I remember their beach body workouts that were a part of an ongoing 5 month series and their total body workout plans that would be kicked off in January issues. Every issue would be full of cardio and strength training plans, along with express workouts and specific moves for arms, abs, etc.This magazine used to be so inspiring! Now when I flip through it, I actually get mad at how little this magazine invests in giving their readers a real workout plan. The magazine likes to write articles about the art of exercising but with little to no tangible exercise examples. It drives me nuts to get teased with a picture of a person working out only to turn the next page and see text descriptions of what to do. Seriously? This is a fitness magazine and you canÂ’t provide a picture of the exercise you are recommending, you want me to read a text description of what to do? Another annoyance I find is how Shape will feature pages and pages of glamorous fitness models posing and flexing their lean muscles in trendy workout clothes, along with text describing how great a workout you are going to have. After eagerly turning the page to reach the actual workout Â‘sectionÂ’, I see one page crammed with tiny photos. Shape will only dedicate a single page to the exercises after the huge buildup. They donÂ’t even lay out the exercise photos with enough space to separate out the moves, they are smashed together and shrunk down. Also, the exercises are not that attainable - some of the moves are complicated but with the limited photos, you are left puzzling over how to move from step 1 to 2. And that is only if you get any kind of exercise plan. IÂ’ve just flipped through a years worth of Shape mags that I have been needing to recycle, and it is not predictable to see any workout plan laid out per issue. If you enjoy reading about exercising, but not interested in actually doing it, then this mag is fine. But I wish Shape would make big changes to their direction. I am so profoundly disappointed in what it has become and will no longer subscribe to Shape.",72341,2604,2605,0,"I bought this as a cheap subscription for my fitness studio. I haven't looked at the magazine in a couple of years. I forgot how lame it is, and now it is even more ads than ever.

I counted 63 add pages out of 136. And most of the content is beauty and food.

I bought this hoping for information and inspiration related to get in shape. This is not that magazine. No wonder it was $5 and is failing. Do not buy this magazine if you actually want information on getting in shape.",72343,2606,2607,0,"While I enjoy reading Woman's World, I don't like the digital version of it.

It is an effective bactericide and has recently been widely used to replace parabens, especially in natural products. Phenoxyethanol has been found to be toxic to the body even in small doses.In order to create it, the known skin carcinogen, ethylene oxide is combined with a phenol (a chemical compound which is also considered a carcinogen). The process of creating phenoxyethanol may (depending on each manufacturerÂ’s production methods) produce the dangerous by- product called 1,4 dioxane. The EPA has established 1,4 dioxane is a probable human carcinogen. The FDA describes it as being able to depress the nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea. The productÂ’s Material Safety Data Sheet says that it is harmful if inhaled or swallowed or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage. The Chemical Toxicity Database lists that phenoxyethanol may cause central nervous system depression, kidney damage, skin irritation, headaches, dizziness, nausea and drowsiness. If inhaled it may cause respiratory and digestive tract irritation. Japan has banned the use of it in all cosmetics.",72390,2661,2662,2,"I am 56 years-old. I bought this product because I was tired of paying $75 and up for skin care products at department and cosmetic stores. I have been using this retinol cream for two weeks now and absolutely love it! The cream has softened, smoothed, lifted, and firmed my skin and has made it more radiant. It is even eliminating clogged pores and reducing some milia I have. It is the best skin care product I have ever used, and that's significant because I have tried almost everything over the years. The price point for this product is incredible, as well. I am going to order another bottle of this retinol cream today so that I have one on hand when the first bottle runs out. Because I was so impressed with this product, I ordered the three other products by LilyAna Naturals that are offered on Amazon -- the eye cream, the vitamin C serum, and the moisturizer. And I am equally impressed with these products! Throw in the fact that I paid less for all four products than what I previously paid for just one product at a department store, and you have a completely devoted LilyAna Naturals customer.Update:I should have known better than to post a review of a skin care product so soon after receiving it. After I finished my first bottle of the retinol moisturizer, I ordered a second one. I thought the second one smelled a little odd when I opened it, but I wasn't certain. Anyway, here I am a few weeks later with a face full of acne, some of it cystic. It has to be either this product and/or the Lilyana Naturals vitamin c serum I started using at the same time I started using the retinol cream. I haven't had a breakout like this since I was a teenager, but it is just as upsetting and frustrating now as it was then, even more so because you kind of expect it when you're a teenager, but not when you're in your 50's. It can only be the Lilyana Naturals products that are causing this reaction because the the only other things I use on my face are the same cleanser and foundation that I've used for years. At this point all I can do is stop using all skin care products until the acne clears, and then I will have to go back to the department store products I was using before. I even stocked up on the retinol cream and the vitamin c serum because I was initially so excited about the results that I was getting. But now I'm too scared to use any of it, so it will all end up going to waste.

However, after receiving my second bottle I found the product to be extremely inconsistent with my first experience.

First off, it shipped in itÂ’s orignal packaging and by the time USPS delivered it, it just fell out of the torn box when picked up. The tray is extremely hard to put on/off. It doesnÂ’t unfold easily and the straps are swen into the chair so low they do nothing to hold your child in. The straps are swen into the bottom seam and not the middle of the chair like the picture shows. This chair just had too many strikes against it so I returned it and bought the Hiccapop version and absolutely love it. Save your time and money and go ahead and order the Hiccapop to begin with.",72447,2732,2733,0,"I purchased this booster seat for my grandchild. I received the item Monday and opened the box to use the seat this evening.

As I looked closer I could see dried baby food on the legs of the chair, the underside of the tray and baby food stains on the fabric of the chair itself. As we began to unfold the chair, actually pieces of food were inside of the chair. I am promptly returning this item for a full refund.",72448,2733,2734,0,I did not like this chair. The overall concept is great and the reason I bought it in the first place. The picture is incorrect on where the strap is placed. The strap is actually on the bottom so it is not easily used to allow to strap the child in for safety. I was so disappointed that it was not as it shows in the pictures. Other reviews state the same thing. Sometimes I just get excited and don't always read the reviews and wish I had. I returned it after I noticed.,72449,2734,2735,0,"This is a terrible product. Do not let the postive reviews fool you. Everyone mentions the seatbelt issue but that is the least probmatic issue with this product. The biggets issue I have with the product is that there is no locking mechanism to keep it down. Meaning my son while sitting in it was pulling up on it and essentially closing himself up into the seat. The tray is also impossible to get on. If you can't line it up perfectly there is no way it is going on there, and since there is no locking mechanism to keep the chair down it is nearly impossible to line it up. And impossible to do it with a child sitting in the chair. I never could figure out how to get the tray on before giving up and hitting the return button. I really wanted this to work because it sound perfect in theory and maybe if there is another brand who attempts this I would try it, but this brand did a terrible job at excuiting their design and they clearly don't care since they have done nothing to fix the issues that have been complained about.",72450,2735,2736,0,"I was very disappointed and dissatisfied with the quality, especially since this item was highly rated and even mentioned in the baby bargains book.

It wasn't a lot luckily but what she did throw up went right to the mattress. It also makes a crinkling sound when you move around on it so you can tell its a cheap one.

Just washed them for the first time to get ready for baby and they have not even been used but the ""quilted"" part is basically coming apart like a cotton ball from both sides of the mattress pad. I am SO EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND FRUSTRATED that it is doing this because little bits of the cotton material stuck all over other pieces of laundry and I don't even feel like I will get any use of these. I also don't ever want to wash them with anything else, not even crib sheets because I don't want to have to pick cotton pieces off every inch again! I'm so annoyed that I waited to wash them until closer to baby time. I feel I deserve to be able to return them and get a replacement of different quality!

Big mistake. It's a pain to set up as the app is really messy and not well made. It's also impossible to start a nap timer/countdown at any time other than the exact time you program it for, without waking the child up once the countdown finishes. And as for the phone control (the reason we even bought it in the first place!!!), its spotty at best.

Because the plug doesn't really work this thing gets unplugged to the lightest touch and doesn't have a battery option, so basically only turns on half the time. It is the most frustrating nightlight/noise machine to use at bedtime and nap time. Also, so difficult to manually adjust this when you are in a dark room, because you flip the thing over to adjust the volume (if you are not by your phone), and then it comes unplugged, noise and light won't turn on.

This applies to all three! First issue is the car seat isnÂ’t easy to get the belt in or out through the loop the belt gets twisted and or locks up because of it. The fabric on the top and bottom of the seat is constantly coming off! I hate this! I had a cheap car seat that did the same thing, thatÂ’s why I wanted something more expensive this time. The seats are freaking hard to clean! You canÂ’t just throw them in the washer like other car seats you really have to scrub them by hand . Not such a big problem but when your paying this amount of money I expected more . My car seats feel flimsy and just not worth the money.

The cup holders are so stiff, it is hard for me to open them. It's almost impossible for my son to open them, which makes him very frustrated. It is extremely difficult to get the seatbelt into the belt loop on the seat. Trying to remove the seatbelt from the loop, is even harder. Trying to buckle the seatbelt is a task as well. My wife has to walk around to the other side of the car in order to get the seat belt buckled. This seat is very time consuming to use, and is a major hassle. I don't recommend purchasing this booster seat.",72459,2748,2749,2,"I spent many hours researching for a great best bet high-back booster by the NHSTA, as safety is VERY important to me that also looked great, which is important to my daughter. I concluded that the Evenflo Spectrum would be perfect, as the Maestro has been a great no-frills harnessed booster for my younger son. My daughter could not WAIT to receive it! It arrived today, & it was simple to assemble. The fabric was very smooth & pretty, & the seat is very well padded. However, I didn't heed others warnings. There were multiple problems with the design:1) The high-back portion is beyond flimsy! My 46 lb daughter sat down, & the entire back portion leaned! The seat was flush against the captain's chair. We took it out, inspected that it was all together correctly, & realized the plastic is so flimsy you can easily twist it. It likely works great as a backless booster, but $60 for a backless would be steep & defeat what it was bought for.2) The belt guide is hard to thread & is very narrow. Once I finally got it in there, it indeed did not retract after buckling due to the fabric overlay. If a parent did not pay attention to this when their child buckled in & got in an accident, there would be too much slack & the child would likely be ejected. Even if they weren't, there would be severe injuries from the belt not being able to do its job, which is lock under tension. This seat, that's supposed to save your child's life, could actually cost it if you weren't diligent.3) A mild nuisance is the cup holders/snack trays. They are very difficult to get open & impossible for a smaller child. They are thin plastic, not very deep, & not a functional size/shape.I boxed it right back up but had a very upset child! So, we went looking for a SAFE pink replacement with good cupholders. We looked at other Evenflo products: the Big Kid Amp, & were even more disappointed by the poor construction. Tried the Chase, but it is not adjustable as a high-back booster. They have lost a customer!For $40 more, we got a Graco Wayz & couldn't be happier! It has rigid body, an extended height/weight harness mode, can be hard-latched in booster mode to 100# (the Spectrum did not even have a ""soft latch""), is a beautiful color, & a breeze to install. The padding was only slightly less than the Spectrum but unnoticeable to my daughter. She feels much safer in this one, & I feel grateful to have found a reasonably-priced seat that offers me piece of mind! Trust me when I say the extra $40 is nothing compared to my daughter's life! 4 kids (oldest is now 11), & this is the first car seat I've ever had to return...",72460,2749,2750,0,"WAY BIGGER than the ad says.

I had no issues with the first one I got at babiesrus but this one if left on for a few hours has this strong plastic burning smell. I havenÂ’t used this one very much since buying but now as summers ending I wanted to use it more. I thought at first the smell was because it was new but now months later IÂ’m definitely convinced there is something wrong with it.

We purchased a second one when we were expecting our second child and that one has been tempermental since we started using it about 5 months ago. At first it would take a couple seconds to turn on, which I honestly did not think much of but that got worse. Now it starts fine 80% of the time but takes up to 15 minutes to start whirring a couple nights a week. I could live with that; just a mild nuisance. What really has me upset is the inconsistent sound the unit is producing after a few months of use. Instead of a steady white noise, it sounds as though the rotating parts inside are not spinning smoothly and it makes emits a loud chirping sound. It is very disruptive rather than relaxing which renders it basically unusable.I have also seen other reviewers mentioning the difference in the low mode volume in newer versus older versions. I can corroborate those claims, but we only ever use the high setting.I am very disappointed with my second go-around with the dohm.

It would probably be okay for an adult to use on carpeted surfaces.",72491,2781,2782,0,"I bought this for my studio apartment, where I have several high shelves that I can't reach. I liked that it can fold and collapse so it can be easily stored somewhere, since I don't have much space in my small apartment. Unfortunately, it was TOO collapsable: The stool broke right out from under me maybe the third time I ever stood on it. I also was only standing on it for about a minute while I was putting something away. The plastic snapped and I fell, and the plastic is also super sharp if it shatters. Not worth the money!",72492,2782,2783,1,"This seemed like a handy stool and we have two others by different brands that have held up well for several years. However, we ordered this about 5 months ago and this week my 2.5 year old girl hopped on it to brush her teeth and the plastic side split/broke in several spots and collapsed under her and hit her head. Definitely do not recommend anyone order this brand of these types of stools as they will break under minimal weight.",72493,2783,2784,1,"I had high hopes for this little stool. I used it to step up to my bed which is quite high. At first it wobbled slightly, but I thought that was because it isn't really sturdy since it folds up so the construction is basically wobbly. So I accepted that. Then last night I was getting off the bed and stepped on the stool and the plastic cracked and broke, not at the weak folding joints but right across the solid plastic piece. It threw me off into the dresser where I landed. I couldn't believe how badly it was broken and with such little force on it. I am an average sized woman, not overweight, a senior citizen and handicapped. I used this stool with only light use, putting little strain on it. I feel lucky I only fell into the dresser and not onto the ground where I couldn't get up. I owned this for 6 weeks when it broke, and I used it daily to get into and out of bed. I have returned it to Amazon. So beware, this stool was dangerous for me.",72494,2784,2785,1,NOT SAFE! My poor little girl got her fingers stuck while trying to move this stool!

After a few days, I tried turning it on again and it worked, but only for about 3 days. When it worked, it was wonderful. In particular, I enjoyed the wave sounds. Volume was adjustable and could go from low to high with a good range. I was impressed with such a small portable size producing such a full range of sound. I was looking forward to being able to take it with me when I travel, but alas, that will not be the case.Amazon customer service was very accommodating when I attempted to return the product and issued me a full refund, although to my surprise they told me to just dispose of the item rather than send it back. This gives me the impression that I am one of many experiencing this issue. Upon further investigation, I discovered the reviews noting counterfeit products from China, and much to my shock and dismay, indeed, my product has China imprinted on the bottom with none of the markers characteristic of the Marpac products (initialed and dated with USA declaration). I ordered the larger Dohm sound machine directly from Marpac and confirmed that there is indeed a USA marker, accompanied by initials and dating by quality assurance. I have had no issues with the Brand name product since purchase and will most likely re-purchase the portable version again through them in the future.

I kept turning the machine on and off to make sure it wasn't something else. Definitely the sound machine. Once you hear it, you can't un-hear and it is very distracting. Sadly, this will be returned.",72497,2787,2788,0,"I decided to try this when I saw it on sale and IÂ’m glad I didnÂ’t pay full price. We have and love three of the original Marpac Dohm machines in all bedrooms as well as a travel Rohm.This machine doesnÂ’t compare. The sounds are all very synthetic/electronic sounding. The white noise buttons sound nothing like the Dohm. The others are awful compared to the options on the (much cheaper) red rooster sound machine in our guest room. Also, the plug for this thing is ridiculous. A micro usb plugs into the machine itself and the wall plug has a GIANT usb-to-wall base that sticks out about two inches from the wall. Add in the usb itself and this is an obscenely large obstruction sticking out of your wall.

It had done that before when I had charged it and left it unplugged overnight. After the first time it shut off randomly in the night (about 1 month after purchasing), I decided to leave it plugged into the wall 24/7. It still turns on and plays noise for a few hours, but shuts off whenever it wants. Also, it is difficult to turn on and off, the button kind of sticks so you have to press it down hard for a long time.

But when I went to assemble the unit, the TOP end that was cracked was bowed upward as seen in the photo.

If you tighten them too much, you may cause the joint to separate and cause the item to fail and fall apart. There are only six plastic nubs. Four are used for the feet of the item.

At first I didn't know exactly what she was talking about. Now it is a little late to return the table. I went to her house and saw the problem for myself, and now I read other reviews that describe the same problem. The three legs each have a protruding piece of wood that slides into a groove in the base. Once the legs are in place there is a wooden disk that screws into the bottom of the base to hold the legs in place. Only one of the legs was held securely in place by the wooden disk because either the protruding pieces of wood or the three grooves were not exactly the same size or shape. To fix the problem I took a regular kitchen sponge and traced the shape of the wooden disk onto the sponge using a magic marker. Then I cut a round section of sponge a little smaller than the traced guide. That way if the sponge were pushed down on it would expand to a smaller diameter than that of the wooden disk. I made a hole in the center of the round sponge piece in order to insert the screw that protrudes from the center of the wooden disk. Prior to screwing the wooden disk into the bottom of the table base I put the sponge on the screw. Then I screwed the disk into the base as tightly as I could. In my case, the sponge was not very pliable or perhaps a little too thick. So, I dampened the sponge enough to make it more pliable. Then I screwed the disk into the base using as much force as I could. You will need to push down on the disk as you turn it or you won't get the screw into the grooves that hold it into the base. I am a small woman; so I am not that strong. A stronger person may not have to dampen the sponge and probably shouldn't screw the disk in as tight as they possibly can. Over tightening may break off the wooden disk or strip the grooves that hold the screw in place. The sponge filled in all the gaps created by the unevenly manufactured wooden parts. As a result, the legs were securely in place. Don't forget to make the sponge a little smaller than the disk, or it will bulge out and show. My sponge shows a little, but I can put a little black paint over it, or get a thinner sponge. If I had used a little thinner sponge it probably wouldn't show. The sponge has to be thick and sturdy enough to fill in all the spaces between the grooves the legs fit into and the disk and maintain a good sturdy grip. My only worry is that the damp sponge will get moldy if it doesn't dry right away. That is another reason to use a sponge that is pliable enough and not so thick that it needs to be wet in order to squish it down enough to get the screw into the base. Other than the wiggling legs, the table is made of what appears to be a good solid and heavy wood which gives a good quality appearance. It is not a light weight junky table.

I will keep it. Annoyed that it is not green. The beige color is an ugly shade. I hope that as it gets uncompressed it won't feel like bags of cement. I'll edit the review if it gets more comfortable. The mattress is still pretty hard and sort of comfortable. I can hardly believe how ugly that shade of beige is. Also, the packaging was in tatters when the mattress arrived. I am glad the mattress didn't fall out of the box. I've had this thing for a few months and it's still hard and uncomfortable. You need a three-inch mattress pad because of the size and depth of the buttons. The color remains ugly. I can't believe that any company would send this big heavy thing in the wrong color. They must know that few customers would have the heart or the physical strength to return it. A bummer. I keep it in the basement so no one can see the ugly color. I'm glad it's not human.

Arrived with the back broken and not able to stay up so not able to use as a couch (which is why we bought it). The company was nice and allowed us to return it however the box had arrived torn and and it didn't last through trying to open it so we had no way of shipping it back. So we are stuck with a flat futon that we have no use for. It was at least pretty looking (in color and design). I wish it would have worked!,72615,2915,2916,0,"I had somewhat low expectations and figured things couldn't be that bad, and based the pictures of the cushions shown in both the product description and customer reviews, I figured I'd end up with something that was at least acceptable. Unfortunately, that just wasn't the case. For starters, I ordered one color but received another. I wouldn't have even minded the color discrepancy if this were an acceptable product--but it just isn't, not even close. The cushions are half as full/filled than the mattresses shown in the pictures. I know it says it may take a few days to decompress, but I just don't see that happening based on the material--it's a horribly thin blend that will never puff up and actually support your bum or back. After several hours and shaking things out, the specified thickness of the cushion/mattress is nowhere near 5""-6"" -it's more like 3"" when undisturbed (Pictures 1 & 3), and instantly flattened into 1"" if actually put any weight/pressure on it (Picture 2). If you actually try and lean back, the pillows go right through the frame (Pic 4), and the corner--the best spot--is completely without support or closure since the two ends don't meet and there's a couple inches gap that just doesn't support anything based on the thinness of the cushion (Pic 5). It's like tossing a weighted blanked over a raw wood/metal bed frame and calling it a futon. Honestly, as soon as I looked at this thing and sat down on it, I started laughing like Steve Allen's laughing fit (google/youtube it) because I couldn't believe how bad it was. Lol. The fact that I purchased the protection plan for this garbage made me laugh even more as I slowly realized this is the most regrettable purchase I have ever made on Amazon for $300.

Stay away from this one.Bought this to replace the small couch in my RV. It turned out to be pretty much a piece of junk. The mattress is so thin you can feel the boards when you sit on it. It is so low you feel like you are sitting on the floor. The back pillows were very difficult to get into the small covers they sent with them.Tried to return it to the dealer but was just outside the 30 day return window so it will go to the Salvation Army.

It is the most UNCOMFORTABLE piece of junk I have ever wasted $300 on. The ""mattress"" is so thin you can feel the wood slats right through it. It is HARD and impossible to even sit on, much less sleep on with any reasonable semblance of comfort. The picture is very deceptive and makes it look very cushy and comfortable - but it surely is not. It was also difficult to put together since the holes don't line up. It would be impossible for me to disassemble and repack this thing for shipping since I have no one to help me, otherwise I would send it back in a minute (the mattress is extraordinarily heavy). I suppose that is what the seller counts on. I cannot imagine why anyone would want this awful thing unless you want to be sure your visiting relatives will not stay for more than one night - or they may not stay at all if they sit on it first.

I bought three different ones, oversized sofa, loveseat, and the recliner. Everyone but the recliner stays clipped and in place.

Right now there's no strap holding it because it doesn't go across and the metal piece just twists and falls off. Please correct this problem. This could be a good product.",72649,2953,2954,1,I would give these 0 stars if I could. Even after measuring and making sure they would fit my furniture they only half do.

My dog hopped up and the entire back (held on by an elastic band around the back side of the couch) slipped out and fell down. The husband tried to tighten the band up, but it's stretchy... Duh, not going to get tight enough to hold the back in place. Oh well, we went for plan B. Lets tuck the back and sides into the couch to at least protect the seating surface. Even this is no match for a dog or person sitting on top - the entire cover slips, slides and looks like utter crap.

Increment in price would work to re-coop costs from QC upgrade. And, BTW, I loved the wood and with a week of use it appears solid.After two weeks with it here are my recommendations. Take three or maybe four phone books from a large metro area. Place them in a stack on the floor and have a seat. Now, stand from your seated position.

These are all nice group activities, but they donÂ’t connect with the activity of playing a board game to me.Tired of Life Jr., I bought the Â“regularÂ” version only to find that the charades-like activities were part of this game as well. Also, it seemed as though all we accomplished was the exchange of moneyÂ—it was constant ... and boring. ItÂ’s just not fun with the changes to how players interact with the game.If you loved the original Game of Life, pay more for the classic versionÂ—youÂ’ll be disappointed by this one, I can almost promise.",72697,3005,3006,0,"Bought this for my Husband as a Christmas gift. We finally pulled it out to play and it was just terrible. The gameplay has been changed so much and there is really no challenge to the game. The entire game, between the two of us, we only had 3 cards that required us to pay the bank or another player. The rest of the time playing was spent collecting money every turn. We even re-read the rules multiple times to be sure we were playing it right.On top of that, the spinner does not spin well at all. We were so disappointed all around with this game.",72698,3006,3007,0,"This game is trash. It came to my house sealed and when we finally got through setting it up, we realized it was shipped without any money included. How on earth do you mass produce something as large scale as a board game and forget to include the most important part other than the board itself? The board is also cheaply made with pieces so small even superman couldn't see them. Honestly this game stinks out loud. To make this worse it all happened on Valentine's day. I was going to let my wife win for once and score some brownie points but Hasbro had other plans. Sad.",72699,3007,3008,0,"If I could rate it a zero stars I would, this is NOT made with quality in mind. It is not like the connect 4 I grew up with, this is cheaply made thin and not sturdy. The bar on the bottom the slides is horrible, thin comes off the tracks. The rest of the game is just as cheaply made not the thicker sturdy material I was expecting. My boy would not understand getting a different one since Santa brought it so I can't really return it in hopes to getting an old model that is sturdy.Although the game itself is still fun.",72700,3008,3009,0,"Unfortunately a pretty cheaply made unit -- very flimsy, the chips are the perfect size for my 10 month old to put entirely in her mouth, and the pieces don't release easily from the game when you slide the bottom guard, so you have to rock it and wiggle the last few pieces out.

I do not recommend which is too bad, because the game concept is nice.",72702,3010,3011,0,Just opened up the game and was very disappointed to find that there's no bottom blue piece to keep the chips from falling through!!! A big miss!!! Brand new game now has to go to the trash. What a waste! Unfortunately the return window is closed - I never thought I'd even have to check to make sure such a simple game has all the vital pieces. Pretty ridiculous.,72703,3011,3012,0,"I can't believe all these positive reviews. Their expectations must be frighteningly low. I've played connect 4 all of my life. Yes it's an awesome game. But opening this box was a slap in the face. Hasbro could not have made this thing any cheaper. There can't be more than 15 cents worth of raw material in there. I bet it costs Hasbro more to print the box than it does to produce the game. I tossed out my last connect four game because my son was too young for it, and it seemed like the parts were always laying around the house. Big mistake. The old one was well made and would have been durable for a lifetime. I didn't know they changed the construction. The one I bought recently is so cheap; I'm too embarrassed to have this thing out in front of adult company. The plastic has the strength, rigidity, thickness, and consistency you would expect to find in toys at the dollar store. This reeks of a CEO compromising a company's good reputation for increased profits. Hasbro revenues are $4.6 billion. They can afford to make this toy many times better, sell for the same price and still enjoy enormous profits. Hopefully Hasbro can make some corrections and go back to making a product that people will want to have in their homes.",72704,3012,3013,1,"I think Amazon needs to offer a minus star category! Hasbro missed the mark by a country mile on this game. Could the game experts at Hasbro please tell me the reasons behind changing the game so completely from the original version?

Instead come up with an additional $6 and buy the retro version.",72705,3013,3014,0,"This is not the original sorry game. It only has 3 pawns per team instead of the traditional 4. The rules are different also. These rules state that you can exit your home zone with any forward moving card..which is everything except for 4?!?! They ruined the game!

Look for the original!",72706,3014,3015,1,"This is not the original Sorry I grew up with. They made it way too easy, by changing a few rules (you can move out of start with any forward-moving number card, instead of having to draw a 1 or 2) and decreasing the amount of pieces to move per player to 3. After playing the old one with my young kids, this one was a major let down. If you can, track down the older version. Skip this one.",72707,3015,3016,2,"I would give this zero stars if I could! If youÂ’re into the original sorry game, DONÂ’T buy this version. They changed the rules entirely while ruining the whole game! There are no long 4 pawns per person, they only have 3. And rather than only being able to get out on a 1 or 2, you can get out on any number.. oh and the Â“sorry!Â” card which allows you to bump someone back to start, now also has the option to move 4 places. ItÂ’s like this game was created for this new generation of entitled children that canÂ’t take the time to finish a challenging game the right way without throwing a fit because they have instant gratification issues.

One reviewer called it the Millennial version, and I'm going to agree. The original game was an excellent tool for teaching kids to suck it up if things didn't go the way they wanted. Everyone else's pawns are out and yours are still in Start because you haven't drawn a 1 or 2? Too bad! Your opponent drew a Sorry card and sent you home? Deal with it! This new version is for wimps and crybabies.And why only 3 pawns? Cutting costs, most likely.Hasbro, you've mucked up a great game. I'll be looking for the real version and donating this one (though I might put a warning on the box).",72709,3017,3018,0,The game board is not one of the better layouts I have seen. Card arrangement leaves players hunting for their card on the board and often places the duplicate card in very close proximity. Blue and Green game chips are both very dark. Not the easiest to differentiate in certain lighting conditions or if anyone is slightly color blind. Need better contrast between colors. Red chips are too few in number to be used as alternate color.,72710,3018,3019,0,"I'm just in shock because I paid almost 14 dollars and I expected at least for all the details to be there.

There were 50 of the blue and green but only 35 of the red. Unfortunately we didn't find this out until we played a particularly long game and my daughter ran out of chips before the rest of us. We're outside of Amazon's return window so tough luck fur us I guess.

My childhood is let down.",72716,3026,3027,0,"I should have listened to the other reviews. The pieces are made in an extraordinarily cheap way. The idea of the game is to pull pieces out based on the pressure points, not to overcome MAXIMUM friction. The pieces are not smooth at all, have little weight, and a few of them were warped out the box. I should have held on to my Jenga game from 10 years ago. Unfortunately, I had this shipped overseas AND the return fees are just not worth any extra cost.",72717,3027,3028,0,"Love this classic game, but they cut corners and it shows. I actually bought this as a second game for parts. The money isn't enough to even start the game with 4 players or the bank will almost be out. Also there is not enough houses or hotels to cover the whole board. You only get enough hotels for half the board so when everyone wants to build you can't. They should at least give you enough pieces to play the game. Also the chance and community chest cards are so few you have to reshuffle constantly to play a full game. They cut costs too much to where you constantly feel the lack of components in every manner. I would have bought an older version if it had all the parts. Instead of buying an extra stack of money and houses it was cheaper to just buy two sets.",72718,3028,3029,0,"My daughter and I were SO excited when we got the package in the mail, and wanted to play it right away.

I understand they love this game, and that's fine, but it's just not for me. I hate this game. So for anyone else like me out there, don't buy this game.The game is played by drawing destination cards and colored railroad cards. The objective is to finish a railroad track between two cities. You compete with others in this and earn points.At its most simple, the game doesn't sound all that objectionable, but I hate the mechanics. The randomness of card drawing, the sabotaging between players, the lack of any real accomplishment... I play this game and don't feel like there's any purpose. It's outright boring. It's tedious. It's long and slow. It's like an adult version of Candy Land.Games are hit and miss with people. This one obviously missed with me. I don't know how best to pass along to someone else how they'll feel about this game. Maybe my description will hit home with you and I'll save you the agony of playing it, maybe you'll have to go through it yourself before realizing it's not a hit for you, or maybe you'll like it. Maybe you just need to give it a try.Do I recommend it? No, not even if you're bored and looking for something new. Will you like it? You may not know unless you try it.How's that for conflicting advice?",72726,3037,3038,0,"Love Catan, it's a great game... but I think I received a third-party product. The game board is cut badly.

The orange and red pieces are so close in colour that it is hard to tell them apart when playing. The wooden roads are cut badly. They are not smooth, but rough on some sides. I have some settlements that are cracked as well. Please check all your pieces when you receive it.",72727,3038,3039,1,"I am extremely upset with my purchase. The overall quality of what I received would be barely worth $10, much less $45. To start out, the game box came damaged around the corners and edges. Removing the individual pieces resulted in a number of pieces ripping (note that I took great care in removing them). NOTHING is uniform: the roads are cut horribly and look more like my attempts at arts and crafts in kindergarten; I received three complete sets of red, orange, and white settlements, cities, and roads, but my fourth set consists of 4 yellow cities, 5 orange(!!!) settlements, and 15 blue roads. Is that something I can fix with a paint brush? You bet. Should I have to fix the pieces of a newly purchased game? Absolutely not. Additionally, 2/4 white cities are discolored and poorly cut.I've grown to love Catan and will be moving out of state soon, so I felt that it was time to purchase the game for myself since I won't be able to mooch of friends any longer. I had hoped this $45 purchase would allow me to bring the joy of the game to my new home and share it with new friends; I will not be able to do that with this set.A warning/suggestion: buy directly from the company that makes the game, not from Amazon.**EDIT:After further inspection, the border pieces also do not fit together properly.",72728,3039,3040,0,"Good game but seller provided a mismatched set, with missing pieces.It looks like this set might have been composed of spare parts harvested from different batches or used sets.

Regardless of whether they are joined end-to-end according to the printed numbers or not, the pieces just do not fit together. We have to play with the outer tiles disconnected in one place so that the resource tiles will all fit in. Not a huge deal but pretty disappointing considering I purchased this as ""new"" and expected it to work completely.The third problem is that the white player's five settlements are missing. We play with small white beads instead. Disappointing.One last minor issue is that since the compentents are from mismatched sets, we have a yellow player but an orange reference card.

In the game, some people are good and some are evil and the whole game is about finding out who is good and who is evil. It is a simple game where you discuss who is evil and good and try to prove your innocence, whether you are good or evil. The evil people must lie and deceive to win. The good must use deductive reasoning to discern who is evil, and this is actually the really fun part of the game.When playing this game as a family, I watched as my two chatty teenage sons became quiet and hardly said a word. They had picked evil cards and clearly they weren't comfortable lying about their innocence and then trying to convince others that other good people were evil. I also picked an evil card and though I was much better at it than my sons, it made me very uncomfortable to deceive and lie to my family and my children's friends. It is not a game of just bluffing, it is a game of all out deception. The better liar you are, the better you will do if you are chosen to be evil. What was terrible is that we, the evil 3, won.This is not a game that I am comfortable with playing in a group of friends or family. We simply don't feel that we should teach our children that they should never lie, and then tell them it is OK just for a game. I'm sure my children would have become better liars as they played the game a few more times, but who wants to develop that trait in their children or themselves?

It is clearly evident that the cards were wrapped to soon, since these were the last three cards in the deck. Hopefully the company does the right thing.",72751,3066,3067,1,"We've seriously been waiting 9 months after sending 1 email a month and we have had no response! The game itself is incredible, but we received two of the red disease cube bags and no yellow cube bag, this makes the game SUPER frustrating because it is possible for the diseases to overlap. If you run into this issue just return the stupid thing and try again. The game is amazing, entertaining, challenging and intense. Nobody who is in to board games should miss out on this, but I've never had such horrible and non-existent customer service. Z-man games is pathetic.",72752,3067,3068,0,Bought it after reading many positive reviews and watching gameplay on Youtube. The game is incredibly simplistic and boring. There is very little room for strategy and player interaction is non-existent. This may be a good game for children under 10 years old. It's closer to a puzzle than a game.,72753,3068,3069,0,"Package came sealed. I opened it and one of the punch out cards was missing a tile, I thought it might have fallen out inside the box; I took everything out and checked the whole box. My thought was how does a sealed game have components missing. Well this a bummer for me I was excited to try this game out. It might be just a lemon. Personally I expect when I pay for a new product for it to come with all the components.",72754,3069,3070,0,Just opened it up and the product quality is horrible. The production company really messed this one up. I'm very disappointed that the game looks like it has been used for years the first time I open it. The punch board pieces were not punched down all the way and it caused the pieces to get damaged and marked. It took a while to prep the game. Also the box has a lot of damage external and internal damage. Especially where you store the parts. Still excited to try the game out but just disappointed in the cheap production.,72755,3071,3072,0,i bought the game as a gift but it arrived damaged. i had no time to exchange it and had to give away a damages gift!! I am quite unhappy about this.there had been plenty of room in the box. i think an item with clearly visible damage has been packed(the game itself is lots of fun!!!).,72756,3072,3073,2,"This built quality isn't the same. I bought it because I played this at my friend's place and the material quality was so nice. The chips feel so good in your hand, like professional poker chips.But this is noticingly difference. The chip feels plasticity and the card doesn't have nice finish like my friend's does. This thing is not something worth $20+ anymore, it's going back for sure.",72757,3073,3074,2,"I bought this game after playing at a local board game cafe few days ago. I ordered it as soon as I got home but when I received the game 2 days later I was so disappointed. The game play is of course still the same and the design is same but the chips have definitely changed. Reduced quality from previous printing of Splendor. The only reason why I was so tempted to buy this game after playing a round or two at a cafe was because of chips' poker chip like quality, its heaviness and because chips were actually beautiful like real jewel that fits to the jewel game! The reason why Splendor is not on the cheap side but still worth buying was despite its simple game play and not actually having a board for a board game (only cards and chips are components) because of its high quality chips. Old version chips are heavy and metal-like (also magnetic so proves it's not plastic) and every time you lay a chip or take chips away during game play it makes nice and loud clanking noises that add to the gaming experience like playing with casino chips. However the copy I received were definitely plastic chips. I bought splendor because I was absorbed by beautiful components but now nothing about the game is beautiful as the chips are mere plastic. NOT WORTH TO PAY 29.99 for less than 50 cards and about ~30 plastic chips.",72758,3074,3075,0,"I love this game but what I received was a cheaply made package. The cards were dirty and gritty, not slick like any new deck of cards. The tokens were really cheap and discolored. Looked like. They had been sitting out in the sun for weeks. ALso looked like they just fell into the toilet and someone fetched them out and packaged them together with gunk still on the edges. Some of the tokens didn't even come with any stickers.And to think I paid $40 for this cheaply produced game.",72759,3075,3076,0,"We are a smart family who enjoys games of strategy. This game fails on every level, with the exception of the illustrations (nice work, Pascal) and the high quality of the materials. Clearly the rules were lost in translation, what the what? There are multiple gaps in the rules in addition to a total lack of clarity in the instructions (we had to read the rules several times then made up rules to account for the gaps and to make the game progress forward). We have nearly a hundred games and this is the first & only game that we unanimously say 'BORING.' It takes a long time to accumulate enough gem tokens to buy prestige points so the game really drags.",72760,3076,3077,0,"This particular Splendor game has far lower quality materials than the previous Splendor I got from 3 years ago. I'm not sure if whether the game maker has decided to reduce costs or if the seller is sourcing from a .The chip tiles are much lighter. The actual box is made with flimsier cardboard. The cards are less flexible and feel like worse quality. The game itself is playable, but it feels like such a downgrade from our previous Splendor game. I wish I had bought it in a store.I would have returned it if I didn't buy it for a game night with company.",72761,3077,3078,0,"Well my board came with a misprint. On the bottom where it should be triple letter score it has it written as a triple word score. So now my board has an extra triple word score.. Bummer. Also, the game board is cheap and it is not tile lock at all. There are just little pegs that somewhat keep the tiles in place, but most certainly do not lock. The face of the board is just a sticker put on top of plastic. I like the fact that the board is smaller than a normal scrabble board but some may not. Regretting purchase, but at least I can play Scrabble (kind of).Cons:Cheaply MadeMisprinted BoardNot locking tilePro:Smaller board.",72762,3078,3079,2,"This was the biggest waste of money. Nothing at all like i was expecting. And I'm not really sure where all the good reviews are coming from. Maybe from people who have never played scrabble before...? I dont know. My first issue.. The tiles are much smaller than the original. Which, i guess, isn't a huge deal. My second issue, and it's the whole reason for this review, is that the ""tile lock"" feature, that is suppose to keep tiles in place, does not do this at all. It actually does quite the opposite. As you play Scrabble, you lay down your word onto the board. After placing your word, you go back and count your points. Most people, as far as i know, need to give each tile a slight lift to see if there is a bonus spot under it. Well with this version, as you lift one tile, even in the slightest of ways, every other tile in line with that one gets pulled up too, only to completely jumble the word and make you have to reset the tiles again. I love playing scrabble, and have enjoyed teaching my kids how to play. But i absolutely refuse to even touch this version of it again. Just disappointing.",72763,3079,3080,1,This scrabble game is very cheap made. As a family we have played Scrabble for years. It is one of our favorite board games. The only complaint I have when playing Scrabble is not being able to keep the tiles that have been played in place. When my husband saw this particular Scrabble board on Amazon we loved that it kept all the played tiles in place. With it being affordable we were very excited about ordering it. After receiving it we were very disappointed with how small and cheap made this particular version of Scrabble was made. It is the smallest Scrabble game I have ever seen and is pretty much a piece of cardboard. I do not recommend the Scrabble game to any Scrabble lovers out there.,72764,3080,3081,1,"Shipping was fast and the packaging was adequate. However, you should know that this product is smaller than a typical Scrabble board. I was looking for something that would truly lock the tiles in place, as we have cats that want to be involved in the game. Frustrating! Anyway, these tiles (and board) are much smaller than a normal game, and the tiles most certainly do not lock.Furthermore, the light weight of the tiles makes it difficult to properly place them...or even pick them up. Truth be told, we could do a faster game with our old board even if we just played using our elbows.Inexpensive, so not worth a return. Just want to perhaps save someone else from making my mistake.",72765,3081,3082,0,"I thought this would be good. A Scrabble game where the letters locked in place, so you wouldn't accidentally bump them out of place or scatter when you move the board. Boy was I disappointed. Not only are the tiles hard to get into place, they are easily knocked out of their squares, and bumping the board is just as catastrophic as ever. Maybe worseThe one good thing is that the backs of the tiles are not flat, so you can't mistake the back for a blank, but that's small consolation for a board that is much more difficult to play than the standard.",72766,3082,3083,0,"Our kids were playing the game, and the bug died. I assumed it is the battery that died. Though it has been too soon that the battery died, I thought that it may happen sometimes. I bought battery for hex bug and replaced it, but it turns out that the issue was not due to the battery. The hex bug is dead. Now I have to purchase a new hex bug (8.99 for one or 19 for 5). Not very happy :(.",72767,3083,3084,0,"I got this game for my kids for Christmas and the bug only goes to the right. I started to get so frustrated because I could not get the bug to turn my direction, even though it had a clear path. It would instead essentially go in circles. We thought maybe it was the board and that it was crooked or something. So we put it on a level tabletop and it just went in a circle. Total waste if money. Very disappointed.",72768,3084,3085,0,"Opened this game on a rainy day but it was missing the connector pieces to keep the utensils from moving. I live in the bahamas so products are shipped to a US address & then brought in by a local shipping company. A return will cost more than I paid for the product and more hassle than it is worth. My son loves the hexbug that came with it, however we are disappointed we can't play the game.",72769,3085,3086,0,"Cons:I did receive a defective hex bug piece. I noticed that other people get it with a plastic thing that you pull, and you open the bug package. Mine did not have one, not only that - the cap was glued to the box with a paper, I had to really mess up a Â“collectible itemÂ” package to get the bug out. (Quality control - ???) I could have returned the game and asked for replacement but how can you do it when your kids are already excited sitting there waiting to set it up and play. :(Pros:- Nice big box. Like back in the day when board games came in big boxes and it was kind of a big deal.- ItÂ’s fun! My kids canÂ’t stop playing it.- ItÂ’s unique.",72770,3086,3087,0,"I was all set to write a rave review about this game, we were having such a great time with tons of laughter. But then the bug died... first time playing it! The adults were dismayed, but the kids were shattered! Family members were searching for a replacement battery, but I don't think they've found one yet. But what's the good of getting one if the game is going to quit on us again so soon!",72771,3087,3088,2,I would return this product if I didn't think it would cost too much in postage. Didn't even get to the cards. I tried on one of the mouthpieces and it is painful. I couldn't keep it in my mouth for more than a few seconds. I had imagined the plastic to be much softer. Very disappointing. I was going to use it as a game at an upcoming dinner party. I wouldn't dare ask any guests to put one in...,72772,3088,3089,1,"Disappointed with so many aspects of this game. First, when it arrived, the packaging was shredded and the box of the game itself was crushed and torn like it had been run over by a car a few times. I opened the box to see if the cards and mouthpieces were damaged but they seemed to be fine. However, when I had some friends over to play the game we noticed several things were wrong. First, the cards had many, many duplicate phrases. It's as though they just reprinted the same cards over and over again to make it look like a full deck. So when we played, we would pull a card and it would be exactly the same phrase someone else had just said. This doesn't exactly make the game very challenging. Second, some of the words on various cards were misspelled or incorrect making things very confusing when trying to play. For example, the word basketball was spelled ""baskherball"" on one of the phrases on the card and since there were duplicates of this card, it meant that it was misspelled on several cards. Another example, the word returned was spelled as ""returner"". There were other incorrect words as well. One would think that the makers of this game would perform better quality control and proofread the phrases before printing the cards and selling the game.Overall, I'm very dissatisfied with this product and would not recommend it to anyone. The only positive thing I can say is that the dental mouthpieces worked as they should. This is the only reason I gave this product one star.",72773,3089,3090,1,"After seeing a hilarious video of a family playing this game on youtube last year, I could not wait to find out what the name of the game was, order it, and take to our Christmas family get-together for what was sure to be a rip roaring good time. (heck, I purchased a bottle of Patron for margaritas to sip on as we played) However, I don't know what that family on youtube was doing to have the cheek retractors impair their speech in such a hilarious way, but I can assure you it was not solely from the cheek retractors provided. My daughter was visiting for Thanksgiving and convinced me we should try them out for a laugh before the unveiling at the huge family Christmas party in December. Boy, am I glad I allowed her to persuade me. We opened up the box of extra retractors (there are two sizes neither work) and they are easy enough to get into your mouth, and yes you do look ridiculous. In fact, the two of us had a jolly good time laughing at what the other looked like. But, the fun stopped there. Just for the sport of it, while her dad looked on, we tried talking to each other. We could understand exactly what we were saying. We thought maybe it is specific phrases that contain certain constant or vowel sounds that cause the problem. While ""B's"" and ""P's"" are a little garbled we still knew what was being said. My husband just shook his head and walked away and under his breath was heard "" what a waste of money"". My adult daughter and I brought up phrases on line and tried those like rubber, baby buggy bumpers and bible book club - a little garble, but still no problem understanding what was being said. - Don't waste your money. There are plenty of funny family games out there, this is just not one of them...........But, one redeeming thought: they would be great for the family Christmas photo.",72774,3090,3091,2,"I was really excited to get this game for my 11 year old brother as a Christmas gift. We were going on a family trip and I thought that this would be a fun game to play as a family. Before we left for our trip, my brother and I played the game and I was not impressed at all. First, the plastic mouth openers HURT! And it didn't matter what size we used; I tried the small ones and they were still uncomfortable. We couldn't keep them in our mouths for more than 30 seconds before we had to take them out. Second, the phrases were really weird that crossed over the 'weird, but fun' line and made it something that wasn't even fun to play. Part of the enjoyment of the game is your partner being able to guess what you say, so we ended up going through the stacks of cards to find phrases that weren't completely weird random words. We played it for about five minutes and then decided that it wasn't even worth taking on the trip to play with the rest of our family. If I could return the game, I would because it just wasn't very fun.",72775,3091,3092,0,I ordered this game for a weekend road trip with friends. We wound up not being able to play for more than a few minutes because the spacers were painful. It's not the actual keeping open of the mouth that is the problem. The spacers rub against your upper cheeks/gums when trying to speak which caused pain. We tried both the medium and small spacers and found the same issue with both. We didn't play more than 2 cards before we gave up. I will say that the 2 quick rounds we played were a lot of fun. It is unfortunate that such a fun game has this design flaw.,72776,3092,3093,0,"Great game, but this box came to me like it had even bruised and battered and carried through several fascists hands. There is multiple cuts on the box and two edges of the box are ripped. There is also a hole in the back but I assume that is from the shipping because the outside shipping box had the same hole. Regardless of the shipping though, the box already looked used and worn and I definitely did not pay $35 for a hand me down.",72777,3093,3094,1,This game is disgusting. How can you people play it?

VERY high quality)The first few times you play this with your friends you'll have a ton of fun and laugh and think its a great game. by about the 8th time you realize that the element of chance completely ruins a deduction game. The whole idea is you're supposed to figure out who hitler is by analyzing peoples behavior (playing liberal or fascist tokens). However, about 30% of the time a player is forced to play one token or another with the rest of the table having no idea if it was by choice or not. What this means is that there is no real strategy to the game is basically random. This game is never coming off the shelf.",72779,3096,3097,0,I was super excited to get this game because I had played it with some friends over the holidays. After receiving the game I noticed that not all the pieces were provided. I messaged the seller but didn't receive a response.

Everything feels like one giant product placement for Disney, the quick time attacks are all Disney theme park rides and the worlds feel as though they were chosen because of their popularity instead of any real reason to the plot (looking at you Frozen and Toy Story). In previous games, there were Disney worlds, but they had unique-ish story lines instead of plots directly from movies and the original worlds were amazing (Traverse Town, Twilight Town, Hollow Bastion, Castle Oblivion, The World That Never Was etc. . .., Disney seems to be pandering to its fans -- was anyone surprised when the full song of ""Let it Go"" was included with an almost shot for shot remake from the movie? It's also disappointing that Cloud, Leon, Yuffie, Aerith and Cid are all missing when they played semi-essential roles in the first two games. Also there are times when the it feels more like brief game play between long cut scenes, instead of vice versa.

Exclusion of any Final Fantasy characters. An extremely shallow combat system that revolves around spamming disney extraction rides, Keyblades that change all of your abilities and make the majority of your equipped base abilities pointless. Terrible story conclusion to the Xehanort 'arc', and I mean truly terrible. Sora is still the most naive and braindead character which was fine back when he was like 12 in KH 1, now he just comes off as a moron with complete lack of common sense.I don't even know if a 'Final Mix' could redeem this piece of garbage thanks to the base combat system being so bloated with annoying disney attraction moves and keyblade mechanics. I don't see how you could turn that model into something remotely strategic and interesting.If this game was a random game Square released instead of being a looong anticipated installment in a series it might warrant a 2 or 3 star rating. But when you compare it to the games in the series that came before it, it clearly missed the mark by a very long margin.

If you are a fan of Kingdom Hearts, grew up with it, and played every kh game there is to play you will absolutely hate this. The game fools you into thinking it is decent or has a chance to get better after the first lackluster world but then NOTHING happens. In both KH1 & KH2 events had impact, here you are looking through an entire 20 hours with nothing of any importance happening all only for everything to be rushed at the last 3 hours of the game. This story is terrible even going in having played all the handhelds and knowing what the story is SUPPOSED to be. But here the plot is so nonexistent you'll wonder what was the point of it all? There are multiple worlds that are large and yet are somehow completely empty. Few moments of story to go along with these worlds and as you play it you will almost feel as though they barely spent 2 weeks on making them. Then the combat is terrible and repetitive. No special abilities because they are all locked behind situation commands. Drives are gone, limits are gone, stuff just happens and the RPG aspect of a supposed ARPG game is gone.

You won't fight a bunch of cards Alice in Wonderland style or square off against Jafar. You're going to fight the same mooks world after world. Mooks, mind you, that are unrelated to the story you're engaged in. You aren't integral to the stories of the worlds you visit. You're just watching a clip show that would end the same way with or without you.Everything about this game has been streamlined to the point of idiocy. The nuance of KHII's combat with it's reversals and situational countermoves has been replaced with mashing the X button. And I hope you like cut scenes, because they're usually stacked two or three deep. Run in a straight line for 10 seconds. Two or three more cut scenes.Teen angst has always been part and parcel to the Kingdom Hearts experience, but they've really turned it up to eleven.They've removed all of the Final Fantasy characters, and they've followed in Disney's recent tradition of pretending nothing before 2005 exists.

I'm not, because I was part of the target demographic when the game came out in 2002. I don't mind waiting a long time for something good. But don't hastily cut and paste your original characters over the top of a disney world they don't meaningfully interact with and pretend it's my fault that it seems off from previous entries.The decimal releases should have been an indicator. They've been putting in a fractional effort for years. Still, it's disappointing to see it.",72798,3117,3118,0,"I really wanted to like this game since I have been a fan since the N64 version but there are so many flaws I don't know how this happens to such a large name title from Nintendo. The biggest flaw is online which was a big selling point. It is AWFUL, Nintendo do still had not learned how to make a decent online game and is about 14 years behind everyone else, the bad coding mixed with horrible input lag makes the game sluggish. Why am I forced to pay for an online subscription when the game connects of a p2p network and every match is filled with lag to the point where it is not even enjoyable. Not to mention when you set your settings for 1v1 preferred matches you never get what you want and are then put into FFA lagfests. You can go to the arena mode but all that is just a waiting in line simulator when you have more than 2 people in a room. Why can you not switch your characters after a match? There are so many things wrong with this game it makes me worried for Nintendo. There are many more problems that have not been noted.",72799,3118,3119,1,This game is absolutely lacking in logic and extremely frustrating to play. Do not recommend. Unfair to the player and biased towards CPU. Has too much nerdy lingo going on to comprehend and remarkably complicated to be marketed as a childrenÂ’s game. I have to record the gameplay and rewatch just to understand what has happened to be defeated and still am often left bewildered and red in the face.,72800,3119,3120,0,"Choosing for glory or for fun was crucial as it didnt force you to play with people who simply wanted to play the game casually online.Now we must set online preferences and hope we get an opponent with a similar set-up. Not only will you be in matches you didnt agree to be in, but they'll likely be free for all or 1v1 matches with ridiculous and different preferences each match......How does that make the online experience better for anyone?",72801,3121,3122,0,"It's great they included all the characters but they got rid of half the game. No Stage Builder. No break the targets. No Home run Contest. No For Glory Mode online. (The only one people care about) I bought the switch for this game and feel miserably let down. It seems like where it matters, they got rid of more than they added. Stage Builder was my personal favorite and For Glory was the only mode I played in Smash 4. This is the first time I've seen Nintendo mess up this bad.",72802,3122,3123,0,"I'm enjoying seeing Yellow Version is semi-good graphics. That's about it. There is not challenge. You'll NEVER feel a worry that our Pokemon are about to be beat. It is so, so easy. There is very few battles compared to the originals as well. You get experience by catching Pokemon rather than fighting. There are gym and trainer battles, but like I said before, you'll mop the floor with every one you meet.It's fun to see updated graphics (The switches graphics are not all that great though), however, the game is a massive let down because of how boring/easy it is.",72803,3123,3124,2,"Overall, I was really excited to get this game. I had played all of the gameboy pokemon games throughout my childhood and only dreamed about playing the pokemon game on my TV or on the go with such a big vibrant screen.After playing it for two days now, I am pretty disappointed by it. The wild pokemon encounters don't actually let you battle the pokemon. Instead, you just spend the next 2 minutes of your life flicking your wrist repeatedly until you catch the dumb pokemon. While I was annoyed with this, I thought that it may be fun for my 5-year-old to try out. After about 10 minutes, however, he was bored with the game mechanics of repeatedly catching pokemon as well. How hard is it to just provide the ability to battle wild pokemon as well as catch them?Its also extremely easy to level up your pokemon. If you catch a wild pokemon all of your pokemon get a decent amount of XP. Within about an hour of playing, I had a bunch of random pokemon caught and all of the main pokemon in my party were around lvl 12. Very little battling occurred to get me to that point, though, and instead, I just had 8 different metapods and other duplicate random pokemon caught and stored. So dumb.Overall, if you enjoy wasting your time on a game that requires no skill at all and very little fun, buy this game. As for me, I am probably going to return it as it was expensive at launch with very little fun to be had.Instead of having an emphasis on training your pokemon and leveling up, you can now pet your Pikachu. Its fun for about 2 seconds and then you will probably never do it again. you also get to put dumb clothes on your Pikachu. Fun for about 2 seconds, and then you stop caring altogether.Also, you can't even use the pro controller with this, another annoyance as sometimes trees and things will get your way but due to the controller limitations, you cannot swivel the camera around.What a giant mistake and miss Nintendo has with this game. There was so much potential to have the perfect pokemon game due to the rich console screen, nice hardware, etc. Instead, we have a game that feels to be trying really hard to be terrible and does not deliver at all. No one wants to catch 10 of the same pokemon. No one really cares that they can pet their pokemon. No one really cares that they can dress up their pokemon. Whoever was overseeing this project/game literally did their best to ruin such a promising game on such a promising platform.I will be looking to return the game as it simply is not fun. What a waste of my life, time, and money.",72804,3125,3126,1,"Putting aside cutting ability, breeding, wild pokemon battles, held items, $40 Mew paywall, assuming modern kids are more stupid to make the game super easy, etc, this game is still a disgusting cash grab because of several reasons:1. There are only 151+2 pokemon....(Gotta Catch 'Em All? Impossible! poor Lance, you can only use seadra since it cannot evolve)2. lagging problem especially if you use lure in virdian forest. Really hard to believe after 3ds age, GF still has lagging problems on NS console.... (GF tech skills number one!)3.The post game content is the shortest ever since the NDS age...(kids now like mobile games, they do not spend time on a console game, so no need to make post game contents!)Also, beating the 151 pokemon masters is the most boring post game content ever... What is the fun of raising a metapod to a high level and make it pound another metapod...... I was thinking that GF might design some minigames for pokemon like metapod, magikarp, and ditto. I really overestimated GF.....4.Many moves are cut in this game, including dragon dances, aura sphere, etc. Other than the moves in gen 1, less than half of the original moves survived in this game. ( a dragonite and gyarados cannot learn dragon dance, a mew two cannot learn aura sphere and psystrike... that is ridiculous)5. Many people are aware that ability, wild pokemon battles and held items are cut, but that's not all!No weather, no fishing, no games in the casino game corner (some people might argue about the gambling law forces them to cut it blablabla... but keep in mind, in HGSS, GF designed a new game to replace the casino game in the game center. But in this game, they just cut it...). Also , no day/night cycle ( children should not play at night, parents will be worried!)6. Even though there are only 151+2 pokemon in this game, the pokemon models still have no improvements since pokemon X and Y. It has been 4 years, GF still makes no effort to improve the models (Blatoise, can you at least shoot hydro pump from your cannons instead of from your forehead?)7. Despite annual subscriptions, there are even less online features than before. (wonder trade, GTS,battle spot? Cut cut cut!!!)8. Many new fans might say they really like interacting with their partner pokemon. But in USUM, you can play with more than 800 pokemon rather than with only one partner pokemon.......Some people might argue: we have told you haters many times! This game is not a main series game and the game for your hardcore fans is coming in 2019! However, Matsuda has said several times in interviews that this is a main series game.........He obviously wants hardcore fans to consider it as a main series game and accept it, but I do not think it works out. A good game, such as Odyssey and Zelda, can keep its hardcore fans happy while attracting new fans. If a game causes a huge division between hardcore fans and new coming fans, that game cannot be considered successful.Also, with less pokemon and a smaller map without sevii island, the game content is even less than FRLG, a game from more than 10 yrs ago. The step back is really disappointing. Since 3ds age, the post game content has been extremely poor comparing to nds games. GF has been stepping back for several year and this game demonstrates that the stepping back is still ongoing. (However, critics like IGN and Famitsu will like it since they can beat the elite four and champion easily and give a quick review. It really makes their job much easier.) In the previous nds games, both hardcore fans and new fans can enjoy the game. Hardcore fans can challenge themselves by playing in Battle Frontier or PWT and new fans can just beat the game and put it away. However, this game totally gives up hardcore fans by removing the most contents without adding any new thing for them.At last, pokemon is about adventure, battling, and collecting. For fans loving adventure, there is not any new city and island on the map to explore with the small original Kanto map. For fans loving battling, the battling is too simple to be fun without abilities and held items. For fans loving collecting, there are only 151+2 pokemon to collect. The game deserves the criticism around it.",72805,3126,3127,2,"so as ive been playing this game i have been finding odd performance issues and there are changes to the way you please this game as compared to the original that dont make a whole lot of sense to me.i even tried to play my game with the joy cons off the console and this somehow triggered two player mode, no explanation, just did it and i have no idea how to turn it off.... and now i have this second player that gets teleported to my area of the game whenever i get to far away.also i know theyre trying to make this game pretty but the animations take way too long, holy moly why cant there be a way to shorten this out....i dont like that they force you to capture pokemon instead of fighting them like in the original to capture them. i dont want to capture every pokemon i see just so i can gain experience....thats not to say that this isnt a good game im just not ok with the changes and i wont be playing it any longer.",72806,3127,3128,1,"These guys sent me a European/Australian copy of the game!!!!!!! This blocks the chance for me to get downloadable content. Absolutely disgusting. I cannot comprehend the amount of disappointment I have felt when I realized this. Of course, it was a marvelous game, but in fact there no point in me finishing it as I cannot access the downloadable content. You will be hearing from me again in the near future. Absolutely unacceptable and disgusting once again.",72807,3128,3129,1,"First of all, the game was AMAZING. However I was sent the EU version of the game and I live in the US. So like everyone else I expected to get the US version of the game. However the game came with a sticker saying it played in English and I went along with it. Game played fine, until this week I purchased the DLC. Now I cannot use the DLC because it is region locked and the disc of the game I have is from EU while the DLC is US and they are not compatible. And as DLC is a digital purchase I canÂ’t just get my money back for that either. So beware purchasing discs from here!!",72808,3129,3130,0,"Purchased this for my little brother for his birthday, when it arrived I found out it's actually the European version. Normally this wouldn't be that big of a deal because the PS4 does not region lock games, but YOU CANNOT buy DLC for the game in the PSN store. You know what that means? You are losing the potential to play countless hours of extra content and enjoyment. Also the subtitles for the game are not in English, so if you are some one who needs assistance with hearing guess what you're out of luck.",72809,3130,3131,2,"I purchased the game brand new from Amazon, and then purchased the DLC pack from the PlayStation Store. I downloaded the DLC but couldnÂ’t get it to install. IÂ’ve been searching the internet trying to figure out why it wouldnÂ’t install, even deleting the entire game and reinstalling. Finally, I found a YouTube video that showed all of the common issues preventing DLC from downloading. It showed how to look up the CUSA code to see where the disc originated. After googling the code, I see that the disc is from the EU and thatÂ’s why I canÂ’t install the DLC. Why would Amazon sell this disc in America? Disappointed. The return window has passed so I have to go buy another game to play the DLC. I feel cheated. I buy my games through Amazon, but now I have to re-evaluate that process.",72810,3131,3132,1,"The game is beautiful and the story is great. However, Amazon sent me a European version, living in the US I cannot install and play the DLCs. Read the other one star review, big fubar on their part. The game they advertise is the US version but if you receive the version shown in the photo (notice the different rating) it will not work with anything from the PlayStation US site so buyer beware. You will have to purchase a US version and reinstall the whole game if you want to play the DLCs. If you donÂ’t care for DLCs then enjoy whatever version they send. Quality control is overrated anyway.",72811,3132,3133,0,Never received the game or game system the return request now IÂ’m doing taxes just shows it wasnÂ’t processed and also this game was the only other item but thereÂ’s no place to request refund. IÂ’m just sick or everything being hit or miss or broken. Had to select a star but even one isnÂ’t accurate it should be zero!!,72812,3133,3134,1,"How the hell are there all the great reviews. This is supposedly one of the best games of all time? What a joke. You run around aimlessly wondering what the hell to do and where the hell to go. You have to keep going to look at youtube videos almost constantly or you'll never progress at certain points. While you're trying to fight a boss your weapons keep breaking. You have to stop in the middle of the battle to replace them and then eat f'ing food to replenish your hearts. Then if the boss doesn't beat you with one almighty strike the view is terrible and has you in the wrong direction. By the time you find your bearing and face the boss again it's time for another almighty strike and your either dead or down to almost no power. There's so many buttons to do different things that are needed at certain times you can never keep track. So you hit the wrong button and guess what?? That's right another almighty one shot strike that almost or does completely end your life again. I got so mad I twisted the controller. i wanted to chew on it and swallow it so I could poop it out later on. At certain points it's basically impossible to make it to certain area's without special clothing, powers or weapons. And there's no way you'll ever find out how to obtain these things without again differing to youtube videos. Unless you want to play this game for decades, then maybe you'll figure some of this bs out on your own. You have to have lengthy and stupid conversations with other characters (with words on the screen and ridiculous gestures) over and over and over until you just want to drop dead on the spot with frustration. I'm an older gamer and maybe it's just me, this isn't the Nintendo games of old that for sure. They were almost magical when you played them and so much fun. This game is not fun at all. It's intriguing and you want so much to see what happens next. It's a vast world and so many interesting things you can do. Unfortunately it's so frustrating that it's not fun at all. I keep getting tempted to pick up the controller and try to play through a level or boss. Sometimes I cave in and give it another try only to find the same thing....wanted to bust the system, controller and everything in the house. Then left with emptiness, depression and anger that lingers for an hour or so after. Bad bad bad bad bad!!!!!",72813,3134,3135,1,"I don't understand what all the hype is about over this game. I have been playing it for awhile and I hate it, for various reasons. First, it's an open world game with no sense of direction that I've found. Everything is so vague and there's no way you will figure out this game without consulting the internet for QnA and walkthroughs. One thing I absolutely HATE when trying to play a game. When I want to play a game, I don't want to have to keep stepping away from the screen to go log on my computer to figure out... what do I do next? Where do I go? How do I make this recipe?For example, in the very beginning, you need to complete 3 trials in 3 shrines. Well that's all fine and dandy, except the 3rd shrine is located atop a mountain that is cold. You can't get there without some way to keep yourself warm. I wandered around this area countless hours until I finally by luck stumbled upon some old diary that said something about making a recipe that keeps you warm. Who would have known? You will have no idea until you stumble upon this isolated small shack and find the diary. But doesn't give you the recipe!!! You have to figure it out on your own because the stupid old man wrote the diary forgot the final recipe and it's up to you to figure that out. Yeah good luck with that. The first ingredient is peppers which you can find and pick. The 2nd recipe is raw meat. which takes quite awhile to figure out how to even find. You have to wander around some more until you find some boars in a forest to kill. As for the 3rd ingredient, you will be a week putting together all sorts of different combinations to find the 3rd is a fish. You have no way of figuring this out unless you get on the internet and look it up.I spent hours and hours just wandering around in this game figuring out what I'm supposed to do. I cannot STAND games like that. Just wander around until by luck you stumble upon something related to your quest. At which point, you need to blindly wander around some more.I don't know about the people who wrote the positive reviews, but I have a life. I have a job, I have a family and a home. What I DON'T have, is countless hours to wander around doing nothing. Hours and hours and hours trying to figure out where the shrines are and how to make some stupid recipe that you have to guess on your own. And this is only the beginning of the game. I don't even want to think about what it's like in the later levels.Now that that's out of the way, my other complaint is about the weapons. You have sticks, swords, spears, bows, clubs all sorts of weapons. Cool right? Except they are all junk. After you kill a couple of goblins, the weapon breaks. In the middle of a fight and all of a sudden, your sword has broken!!! Then you have to fart around the menu to equip another sword. You swipe it a few times and oops! It's broke too! Let's try the club. Broke! Equip the spear. Broke!!! I'm tired of hoarding swords and spears in my bag because they keep breaking. And your SOL if they all break. Yeah you can't fight without a weapon. Link just looks at his empty hand like he's stupid. Just ball up your fist and punch the goblin in the face or kick him where it counts. Nope he just looks at his hand. So what do you do when you break all your weapons? You guessed it. Run away. Then you have to waaaaaander around blindly until you stumble on an axe or something. Same with the bows. They break too.And what happens during a boss fight? SAME THING. You dodge his attack and mash him a round then your weapon breaks and he has hardly any damage done at all. But then you have to go to the menu and equip another weapon. In the meantime, by the time that's done, hes coming in for a other attack. Same sequence. Dodge, attack, weapon breaks, replaced. But when he hits you ONCE, its game over and you have to continue and sit through the load screen. Not to mention the music is freaking pathetic and annoying.Weapons breaking, constantly healing after one hit, This is incredibly stupid to have to do when you are in the middle of an intense fight where you need to focus on what your doing rather than mess around swapping out weapons that keep breaking.Forget this. Going to game stop tomorrow to trade this in. I don't have time for this kind of garbage. I bought a Nintendo switch just for this game, because I read it was a good game. Looks like I'm putting the switch away and hooking my PS4 back up and put back in my latest Final Fantasy game, where at least my weapons don't break, I don't die in one hit and I have some sort of sense of direction and what I'm supposed to do.Fing garbage. I want my money back. For game AND the switch. Nintendo can suck it.",72814,3135,3136,0,"Boring. Its a game that incentives you not to play it. Get a good weapon, it breaks, you dont want to use it. Food you make it, want to save it for something else, dont use it. Climbing up a tower like the ladder in a much better game MGS2. Boring boring boring. The lack of music and costumes at the beginning is disappointing. Mario Odyssey definitely deserves GoTY wayyyyyy more.",72815,3136,3137,1,"This. Game. BLOWS. The controls are completely unintuitive and overly sensitive. The damage dealt is inconsistent. Too many abilities to keep straight.... Zelda was SO much better when it was more simplistic. You had a sword, you had a shield, and you had an interchangable utility. Now you don't get a sword, you just pick up whatever's nearby, swing it & pray it doesn't break! You can summon remote detonated bombs? Crouch? Use some kinda magnetic magic? It's gone from fantasy adventure to some kinda SciFi post-apocalyptic future adventure?! You have stamina to worry about?! You can craft meals? The physics are all f'd up.... Guys. Less is MORE. I've never been put off by a Legend of Zelda game before. It started heading that way with Twilight Princess and now... it's just not even Zelda anymore. I wish I'd had a demo to check out first before blowing so much money on this.... How it has 4.8 stars is beyond me. If you like Zelda, don't get this. If you don't care about Zelda, are somewhat self-masochistic and want something different, you might like it.",72816,3137,3138,2,"Just horrible. The graphics are good and so is the story. The gameplay, which is what youÂ’ll be doing with.... a game, is cringe worthy. You canÂ’t jump. Like literally. You see a ledge, you canÂ’t jump on or off it, and the menus feel elementary, like they were a school project. Refinement is not what youÂ’ll get here. After about six hours I couldnÂ’t take it anymore.",72817,3138,3139,0,"I know millions have played the game. I can't apparently. And from what I'm experiencing, I dont' know how people have managed to. Since putting a web link will probably get this deleted, search for ""God of War 2018 Launches to Black Screen then Crashes when Attempting to close application"" and you should find the EU playstation forums post regarding this. Now, instead of typing alot, I'm just going to copy what I sent Sony, SonySantamonica, and Cory Balrog in a tweet...""This EXACT problem is happening to me as in that link from the EU forums... Happened last month, and just (today) I bought a 2nd NEW copy of God of War. Same thing happened today. I start the game, the splash screen comes up, then nothing, just a black screen to infinity (I let it go on for half an hour once, nothing loaded). I have to hit the PS button back to the PS4 menu, close application, but then instead of just closing, i get the same error code mentioned in that forum post as well. I report the error (or not) then it goes back to the PS4 menu. Same thing happened today with another new copy from best buy (last month was from gamestop). Except instead of getting an error screen w/code, it went back to a black screen and the console was COMPLETELY unresponsive. I had to unplug it, then wait for disk checks after turning it back on.I have a launch style ps4 (touch buttons), my other 40 or so disc based games work (however someone in that forum thread said the digital version had the same issue), already tried them all (AFTER being forced to unplug it, console's still fine). If it matters, I can't use HDR either. I have a sony bravia tv from 2012 (after a lightning bolt fried my 1000 dollar CRT from sony, the last one they made i think, that silver one). I saw one article online that said you NEED HDR to play God of War, I'm hoping that was just bad wording and they meant it's better in HDR... I have NEVER in my life bought a game that was literally unplayable. And as I said, my other 40 games work fine. It's not my console, I don't need to format it and reinstall the OS, my other 40 games load fine.

They would have me try another copy of the game, or rebuild the database, or even wipe the hard drive and reinstall the OS. OR send the console in for repairs it doesnt' need. That's pointless.... 40 other games I just tried one by one load fine...Update Feb 2018: I talked with the actual devs via twitter for days, they're clueless and cant' figure it out. They even gave me a digital code, that did the same thing. I bought a new, better hard drive for my ps4. When it got here, I wiped the one I was using, reinstalled the OS, and did nothing else but install GoW. Same thing.... put in the new drive, installed the OS, installed GoW.... same thing.

Many have called it mature... dark... even-paced. I call it boring, repetitious, overly linear and annoying (and not just the kid is annoying).The combat is very boring. It takes forever to kill a few enemies. Sure there are techniques to do so quicker... but it's a sluggish mess to do so. It's clearly taken from the Dark Souls franchise. Where is the God of War I played years ago? Even the first boss battle was a huge disappointment. I barely received damage on it... it just took forever. Once you learn to time shield block, well... time to punch...The levels are slow and linear. You walk in a line... then you see a chest... then you loot the chest... then you continue... your son runs up a cliff, lets down a chain... then you climb the chain... then you keep walking in a straight line again.What is likely the most frustrating and annoying thing is that the over the shoulder camera blocks enemies to the front left of you. I can't tell you how many hits I receive because the damn camera is blocking everything. Well you can move the camera up a bit, but then you can't throw your axe... which is a core mechanic of the game...No... no... what is even more annoying is how I am running at an enemy I need to kill first, but then my camera latches on to another enemy as I am sprinting toward my foe... now I get shot in the back by the enemy I wanted to originally target.No... no... no... what is even more annoying is the darn kid. I thought Kratos-dad told him to shut up? Why am I baby-sitting this kid in a video game anyhow? I'll never know...

Instead of taking on a dozen enemies at the same time and feeling powerful (original trilogy), you have to slowly hack a single enemy with a stupid ax, practically one at a time, and now they can sneak up on you because the camera is horribly fixed behind you. Or you can throw an ax over and over again...and over again... Taking down enemies feels tedious and like a chore, not a blast like it was in the original trilogy. Also, roughly 1/3 of the gameplay is a walking simulator.Story: The forced story with the son narrative is derivative, and entirely unoriginal. It's such a blatant copy off Last of Us, with much inferior emotional impact. It just feels weak, and is full of long scenes you can't skip, where you get to watch Kratos play dad (yawn).Kratos: Instead of a badass angry God who runs around and destroys everything in his path, Kratos in this game walks slowly through long traila and cannot jump. The kid follows around and provides really annoying commentary. I kept wishing there was an option to let the kid die, play a stupid crying cut scene, and then be rid of him the rest of the game. Not an option, so you get to be Kratos: ""God of Babysitting.""Originality: There is almost nothing original about this game. The gameplay has a much inferior copy of dark souls and bloodborne play style. The story is a bad version of last of us. The recallable ax is a blatant copy off Thor's hammer from the Marvel movies. In the original series, Kratos was an original, angry, and powerful character who was fun to play as--not anymore.The developers turned Kratos into a wimpy character, and they went to the press virtue signaling about how ""deep"" the game was.It wasn't deep and it was a tiresome, tedious, chore to play. After playing this I had to put in God of War 3 and whoop on its awesome bosses, just to take out my frustration from them ruining such a great character and series.Real Kratos would want revenge for seeing what these guys did to him in this game.

I played RDR1, GTA5, Horizon zero dawn, assassin creed: origin, the witcher 3: wild hunt. god of war etc and I enjoyed them a lot. But for RDR2, i didn't have that feeling.

If I knew the game would be this, I wouldnt have bought it.The first thing you'll notice is the confusing and frustrating controls. For instance if one is on a horse, and spots prey, or gets into a fight, you'll instinctively pull the left trigger to aim whatever weapon you selected. Except now that's not what happens. Now you have to aim, then elect to draw your weapon, then fire. And most of the time it won't pick out weapons you want. Way too many steps when you're panicking because someone's shooting at you.They also took away essential features, such as fast travel. You also have to remember to grab your weapons off your horse before stopping. It's difficult to predict what a control input is going to end up doing. The whole game is extremely frustrating. I've played it for several days, and I'm still waiting for it to be fun.The magic of Red Dead 1 is gone. There are some improvements here, but really it's just the same game with a different setting, more drudgery, less fun, lazier plot, and frustrating controls.",72823,3144,3145,2,"Want to play a western game where you are bossed around by women who lower their voice and try to add some growl into it?

It has a lot of problems. The biggest is just being flat out boring. I've played 5 hours and there has been nothing to hook me in. Just boring, slow, emptiness. Now I thought that Octopath Traveler had a boring story (which it does) but there are other redemptive parts of that game like the combat. The gun play here is trash. Considering uncharted is 3rd person coverbased they should have just copied that and saved on the 100hr work weeks. This is being hailed as the next step forward. With that in mind I have to compare it to a game that was the next step forward The Witcher 3. Within 5 hours of starting The Witcher I was having a blast from the combat to a compelling story and world. Red Dead 2 has none of this and while there are many technically inferior games they have some redemptive quality. Red Dead has no redemption.

You can buy the eShop version and get a free upgrade to the new ""Minecraft"" edition, that this is. Your old worlds can even be converted over.

The game in theory, will let people (each with their own Nintendo Online account) to play together without using Microsoft Realms. I thought this would be a godsend, but it seems Nintendo hasn't done a great job aligning the features and my son soon realized that you can create a new world and both of us can play on it, but when we log out he can no longer join that server. Doesn't matter if I make the server/world, or if he does, you seem to only get 1 play out of it. I looked at NAT types, I've tried port forwarding, and slew of other things. Nintendo/Mojang support is not helpful either with this problem apparently plaguing other users.2. The game itself is very buggy considering how it seems Nintendo Online handle latency and other issues. I found myself disconnected on a few occasions, or situations where I could no longer see my son's avatar even though he was right in front of me (I witnessed this over facetime). Other issues like landscape (FOV) not appearing seem pretty common in multiplayer.The singleplayer is fine and the controls once you get used to them work great, but the primary reason I got 2 copies of this was so I could play online and that feature is doesn't work.

If I had known some of the songs that were put on the kids side, I would have never purchased this game. One song on the kids side has lyrics that simply repeat ""sexy me"" over and over again.

This by itself its not bad, except, the way it is implemented here. When you complete a dance, you are given xp and coins. The xp levels up your dance card and the coins are used to unlock avatars, alternate songs, et al. The coins then are fed into a machine (100 for each attempt) and then you get a random item and each has a chance to be an avatar, alt song, etc. It would be far better to be able to ""buy"" what you want but that does not happen here.If you can get past that, the kids to enjoy the few songs they can dance too and the kids mode is ok.

The stories are very basic, too basic if you ask me. I think it's due to the amount of them, you never get pulled into the ""story"" since there's too many!The game starts off fine, one story line, you get to the point where you have to leave the first town and then go to the next, where you pick up the next party member. This means you have to go through their ""having to leave the town"" story line, and then it just repeats. It gets to a point where you just want to (or do) skip the whole story to get to the boss encounter and get it over with.Traveling between towns is very pretty, but very short, which means you only get 10 minutes rest between another mediocre story line.I really lost interest very quickly, I would not recommend it.

I've played the King's Field games, Shadow Tower, Kuon, Demon's Souls, DS I, II, III, BloodBorne... They were flipping brutal too, However, one glaring difference is the payoff in those games. In each of those franchises the story is immersive, character development was not an after thought, and just the sheer excitement of leveling up finding loot that adds to the character and further entices you into the story and the bizarre, esoteric lore of the game is just reward for the punishing game play. Sekiro, however is just lazy to me. Its just designed to be a ball buster for the sake of it.Okay that doesn't make it a bad game, just different I suppose. But I don't like it. I don't play games as a competitive sport, trying to get some damn ball in a hole or a goal, or whatever.

A complete game over. Meaning, you'll have to go back, and figure out which answer the developers want you to give. In short, you don't get to give the answers that YOU would want to give.Updated:after going back and changing my answers to (unnamed character), the story moves forward, and they spend a good 10-15 minutes in cut scenes explaining what happened and why it makes sense.

I've played a lot of them over the years. This one isn't one of the better ones.The way it imports mechanics from the Fire Emblem series is interesting, but it's ruined by the bizarre imbalanced roster. Instead of taking a wide variety of characters from across the whole series, it takes a large number from the most recent games, and a few from older ones. This wouldn't be too bad, but they also focused almost exclusively on sword-wielding characters. With the weapon triangle fully in effect, it's a bit of a problem.There's another, bigger problem. You bring a large number of characters into each battle with you, and you can command them to move to different parts of the battlefield and attack. In most games of this type, your allies are automatically appropriately strong for the level you're in. But in this game, you have to manage all your allies, since they're all playable, except a few pure NPCs depending on the mission type. But the characters you're not actively controlling are just not very good at fighting. They will fall behind in levels fast, and stay there as they won't be able to defeat enemy officers. Unless you want to methodically go through and level every character individually, grinding appropriate maps along the way, it's a disaster.The game has great production values, and a good amount of content with history mode, but the core gameplay has too many problems.

Dark Moon, however, doesn't hold up to it's predecessor.The game seemed very long and drawn out. One frustrating mechanic about it would be you would spend all this time searching for certain items, like a key to a door. You would find the key, then make it all the way back to the door, only to have a ghost steal it from you and run off, leaving you to go back and search for it again. Incidents like this would happen multiple times over the course of the game. It seemed like Nintendo rushed through this game with little creativity, making it very repetitive and monotonous.

Avoid this game, you will end up frustrated.It's beyond me why Nintendo doesn't offer a patch that saves the game after you complete each section of a mission.

This book might be helpful for younger kids, such as 5th or 6th graders, who have had limited exposure to the language arts.

When it arrived, I was immediately disappointed. I read through the book with my 12 year old before I intended to wrap it, but neither of us were laughing at the story. It basically follows the story of one man who goes to the doctor and keeps getting referred to different providers for different tests and being given various prescriptions for the multitude of ailments supposedly related to old age. These visits are interspersed with scenes of the man sitting in a waiting room talking to a fish in the office's fish tank. The cadence of text on each page does not always rhyme or feel like what you'd typically expect of a Seuss book, and the attempted humor often falls flat. I was also very disappointed with the condition of the book I received. The description listed the book as being in good condition with minor wear around pages and binding from previous readings, and as having the dust jacket intact. What I received was a dust jacket with a large, obvious sun-fade line across the top front cover from where it previously sat with some smaller object in front of it in direct sunlight for an extended period of time. This didn't concern me at first, as I may have removed the cover before gifting, but it had affected the front cover underneath as well. To make matters worse, the first page when the book was opened had a large hand-written inscription, in pen, from a previous gift-giver to a previous owner. I debated tearing the page out, but it would have ruined the title page that followed. I went back to check the description of my order to see if I had missed something, but nowhere did it state that even small markings, notes, or highlighted text would be present.

Surely she is one of the great liars of history, not to mention being offensive, controlling, judgmental, and generally someone to avoid.

If you read reviews on the Gospel Coalition and elsewhere they will confirm that the principles touted in this and her previous book are not Biblical. It's very sad to see people with a platform use it for personal glory and advancement and then claim to be a Christian.

However, there are no such interviews, because his book is trash and he isnÂ’t worth interviewing - thus, he must resort to marketing his own personality in the intro of a book all about himself; a book that never dives deeply into habit forming psychology, but instead belittles your intelligence with metaphors of ice cubes melting as the temperature increases (shocker) to outline how incremental habit changes work.

Especially, since Rich Dad is not a real person according to many interview done with him.The silver lining is that there are some solid key points here and there, but what I have to say is that: *it does not take +400 pages to say what he has to say* he is literally rehashing old stories from the first two books and retelling them times and times again.In all honesty, I started this review with a 4-stars review and dropped it to 3-stars in the middle of this review and now at the end of it I'm not even sure if those 3-stars are a correct assessment of the merit of his book.In his defense, he did say he is a Best-SELLER not a best-writer.",72933,3261,3262,1,"This low rating is a combination of two things.

Throw out everything that doesn't bring me joy? That's the answer? Well, no joke. We all know that we have too much stuff and should part with it all. I thought that if I had to read one more time how the author was positively an organizational genius at age 15, I would throw that book...which didn't bring me joy...into the trash. As for making my socks and purse happy, my socks are all cozily snugged up together by color...I am an engineer, after all...and my purse feels it is its honored duty to protect its precious traveling companions...the wallet, the inhalor, etc... 24/7.I, unfortunately, learned some great lessons about parting with too much stuff 8 months ago when my hoarder mother passed away. I bought 120 large trash bags and with a determined ruthlessness, I tossed out 3 tons of trash. Boxed up new stuff for donation. Held estate sales for things of value...which Ms. Kondo does not seem to address very well. I thought that I would gain some insight from this book about purging my own messy house. I don't want to do to my kids what mother did to me. However, this book was no help. As someone else suggested, don't waste your time reading the entire book. Just read the sentences in boldface print. Honestly, that's all that should have been printed but there wouldn't be much money in selling a brochure.",72958,3287,3288,2,"This book is crap. The author feels the need to keep bringing up the fact that she is, apparently, the perfect organizer. She talks about herself entirely too much, and once I got the part about getting rid of all of my books I was like, ""NOPE!"" I understand her concept that you should throw away anything that doesn't make you feel happy when you touch it, but some of her ideas are ridiculous. Get rid of most of your seasonal clothes and only keep things that can be worn year-round? I live in Maine. It gets cold in the winter and hot in the summer, so explain to me what I'm supposed to wear. I had heard some pretty good things about the Kondo Method of cleaning and I just wanted to declutter my house a bit so I bought this book, but I feel ripped off. This was not the one for me.",72959,3290,3291,1,"I may hold an unpopular opinion here, but I think sheÂ’s way too extreme.Let me clarify, IÂ’m all for a clean and uncluttered home, thatÂ’s what attracted me to buy this book in first place. IÂ’m sorry to say I disagree with her on many points.The main principal is hold everything in your hand for a few seconds and if that something doesnÂ’t spare joy, get rid of it. Get rid of anything you donÂ’t need nor use, even if it has sentimental value.Well, here are the many problems: My work clothes and coffee donÂ’t spark joy for me, because they remind me I have to wake up at alarm and go to work. Can I get rid of my work clothes? Obviously not, a responsible adult should get to work and pay bills.My tennis shoes donÂ’t spark joy for me at all. Why do I have to workout? IÂ’m keeping it so IÂ’ll go run because itÂ’s good for health.She stated get rid of books, basically all books if youÂ’d. For example the reference books from the seminar, because those materials had served their purpose (for the duration of the seminar)... guess what, IÂ’m getting old and I WILL need to go back and look.She criticized people that stockpile stuffs at their home (someone with 36 toothbrushes, or 20,000 cotton balls, or too much toilet paper). I agree that most people shouldnÂ’t turn their house into a supermarket warehouse. However you can bet when $10 Charmin goes on sale for $5, IÂ’ll buy 10 packs and have them on my shelf for the next 6 months, because I like to save $50 and supermarket shelf is not different from my shelf. I have joy for saving, take that Marie!!She said, treat your socks and purse well. DonÂ’t roll your socks, donÂ’t turn it into a ball, because they need to rest so they can better server you. Also donÂ’t forget to thank your purse. Say what???She stated, donÂ’t feel bad to get rid of gifts that your friends and family gave you. Whether to keep the gifts is up to my preference, you can be sure that IÂ’ll at least feel bad to get rid of them, because I wonÂ’t treat my family and friends effort and thoughts less than a pair of socks. (Eyes rolling)This getting rid of everything really doesnÂ’t work for everyone. If anyone has aging parents or any older relatives would know. Majority of them are very attached to their things. These things remind them of their lives, their experiences, and make them happy. She recommends getting rid of even items from your children or parents. She started getting rid of stuffs at a young age, no wonder her eyes look empty, sheÂ’s throwing her own history. Thank goodness sheÂ’s not advising the museums, or all human history would be gone.ItÂ’s no doubt that we live under extreme materialism and we have too much stuffs. However no one can be 24/7 joyful from the moment they are born and to the moment they stop breathing, and certainly no one needs to thank their own socks. This whole surround yourself with only joyful things is utter nonsense.My advice: clean up your home, keep functional items, and keep a few meaningful items. Look at that childhood jersey once in a while and remember the happy times you had with your Dad. Touch that dress that Mom made for you from grandmaÂ’s sewing machine. Keep a few of your childrenÂ’s toys and clothes to cherish the happy childhood you provided for them. Keep little toys from the fur babies that went to puppy heaven and remember how much they loved you and followed you around. Keep your high school yearbook so you can laugh with your friends many years from now. Some of these things are part of you! ItÂ’s not a crime to have some stuffs. As long as you donÂ’t live in a mess, as long as youÂ’re not a hoarder and have a clean and functional home, donÂ’t bother with this book and be happy!!",72960,3292,3293,0,"This book just never grabbed me. Reading the first few chapters it felt like I was still reading the introduction and it didn't get better thereafter. The book needs an editor as the story is told without much style and feels like words just thrown on a page, making it very laborious to read. So many of the experiments and anecdotes seemed trivial and were just uninteresting. Beyond the obvious point that our intuition is complicated and sometimes erroneous, I didnt have any other meaningful takeaways. I just read ""Superforecasting"" and ""Blackbox Thinking"" both of which I really enjoyed (BBT doesn't get enough attention in my opinion and I highly recommended it) and Taleb's Swan and Fooled are classics. These books were both interesting and inspirational, F&S was neither.",72961,3293,3294,0,"...why are all these pop-science/psychology/economics books written by out-of-touch coastal academics like Kahneman, who never worked a day in his life as he flitted from one academic ivory tower think tank to the next...bragging about ""working hard"" while enjoying a highly-paid sinecure at a think tank in Oregon just shows how far removed from the average American this egghead is......this book (read: money grab) is a collection of brain teasers and illusions used to show how much smarter and more insightful than the working man this effete academic is - truth is, he wouldn't last 2 weeks in the private sector - in the immortal words of professor-cum-""Ghostbuster"" Dr. Ray Stantz:Â“Â…Personally, I liked the university. They gave us money and facilities, we didn't have to produce anything! You've never been out of college! You don't know what it's like out there! I've *worked* in the private sector. They expect *results*Â…Â”.",72962,3294,3295,0,"I found the introduction and very beginning interesting, but then this book quickly becomes outdated, poorly argued and insulting.This author seems to asses the worth of a person based on how well they can solve little brain teasers like the classic baseball problem: Â“A bat and ball cost $1.10. The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?Â” Tells you to solve it intuitively, then spends the rest of the chapter bashing anyone who got it wrong. He calls them lazy, associates them with lower IQ scores and says theyÂ’re less likely to engage in delayed gratification. (The ball is 5 cents by the way, something I had to work very hard to understand over several exposures to this problem because some of us are really bad with numbers.)It gets worse during the question, Â“How many muders occur in the state of Michigan in one year?Â” If you didnÂ’t factor in Detroit and guess highly, youÂ’re basically a dummy, according to this guy. CanÂ’t possibly have anything to do with that fact that I avoid crime reports to keep my anxiety under control.Next IÂ’m treated to an entire chapter on how weÂ’re all slaves to environmental priming/linguistic association, whether we know it or not. And thereÂ’s nothing we can do about it!At one point the guy references David HumeÂ’s principles of association from 1748(!), calling them outdated, but still a good starting point for what he wants to talk about. If you use outdated information as a starting point, your entire argument is invalid.So in the last roughly 60 pages, IÂ’ve been called lazy and told I have no control over my own mind. And IÂ’ve been instructed to think about my mind in terms of an artificial dichotomy rather than an integrated, holistic whole, which flies in the face of both 12 years of meditation and modern day neuroscience.What is this book even trying to do?

Some of the companies that are praised in this book are already bankrupt or just around the corner from bankruptcy/ government bailout . This book was published in 2001, no word of Apple,Google,Amazon,Facebook etc. so take it for what itÂ’s worth.2) Main problem of this book, its going backwards from results to reasons. ItÂ’s take a Â“successfulÂ” company and try to explain its success came from some master plan that was well crafted. Nonsense, other companies did the exact same to a different amount of business success.3) Nothing in this book relates to the global economy, millennial generation and the mobile retail revolution. This book was published in 2001, this is also its relevance expiration date.Pros1) I liked the chapter about level 5 management, nothing new here but refreshing ideas about humility and open minded leaders.2) I liked the hedgehog chapter about focusing your business on what you love and what you good at to maximize profits.3) Positive lessons about running a healthy company that work as a team.Bottom lineFun read, but nothing new here.

But it is not the unique problem of this manuscript. Self-helping and cheerleading literature, in general, favors positive examples to ""explain"" the successes of the past. Hindsight is always 20/20 and everyone knows it.What really signs death sentence to Collins work is the fact that he chose to study companies and companies that lived long enough to put shame on people who think they can predict the future with a pencil and a secretary. It's now 2013 and Good to Great was first published in 2001. It's been only 12 years since the publication and yet the list of hand-picked ""companies of greatness"" was blown by the wind of change. We all know what happened to Fannie Mae. Circuit City filed bankruptcy. The rest of the list underperformed compared to S&P 500.In other words, Collins is not just ""wrong"" according to his own criteria. He is, in fact, completely random. He could as well throw a dart into a newspaper and come with similar results.So is ""Good to Great"" completely without merit?I don't think so. First, it pays to pick it up used for $0.99 and see how one of the most successful business series books are done. That is, sell pseudo-certainty to gullible people. Second, it teaches a student a whole lot about processes with infinite variance like stock performance. Third, Collins praises companies (like Fannie Mae) for exact same things (clever borrowing against future risks) that ultimately killed those companies.Bottom line? Collins is a charlatan, but there are many lessons to be learned from his failures. It makes it worth one dollar.",72966,3298,3299,0,"Should be titled: Good to Great, How to Overuse Analogies. The use of analogies to help someone understand something they can not relate to is one thing, but the use of analogies over and over again is the sign of a weak mind; I stopped reading when he started using analogies to explain analogies. The data and topic were not very deep, probably grade school level, pretty easy read if you can handle the analogies.",72967,3299,3300,1,"It's hard to know what to say about this book. People love it, and love what it says, but several of the companies profiled turned out to be cooking their books, cheating customers, etc... Wells Fargo, Sallie Mae, GE... So I'm left wondering, were these companies extraordinarily successful because of the processes and ideas presented in the book, or was their extraordinary success based on cheating. I just can't take the book's advice seriously given the track record of several of the companies studied. Maybe if you're passionate about being the best, and you want to be the best in the world, and make tons of money doing it [your hedgehog]- you break the rules to get ahead?? Not the advice I'm looking for....",72968,3300,3301,1,"One of the worst books I have ever read. It comes off very contrived and agenda driven. He dedicates full paragraphs to pronouncing his terms correctly and restates the same concepts multiple times.Four of his so called ""GREAT"" companies are1. Fannie Mae (mortgage scandal)2. Circuit City (declared bankruptcy)3. Wells Fargo ($25B bailout)4. Gillette (bought by Proctor & Gamble).He completely disregards tech companies, and only looks at publicly traded companies. Granted private companies aren't as forth coming with their financial information but he has excluded a very large percentage of companies. He does defend this decision after the epilogue in the ""Frequently Asked Questions"" section. In the end he only succeeds in explaining why this book should have never been written/read; if you exclude all that data from you research it's not very convincing or accurate.The bulk of the book is anecdotes, platitudes, and defensive allusions to previous and better business writers (most often Stephen R. Covey). I'm amazed this man was even able to get published.I think this book is a testament to the business world's search for the next new fad that will come and go quickly.

Amy Sherman-Palladino is great, I loved Gilmore Girls and was expecting a lot from this, but the first episode was filled with unnecessary raunch.

When you can't even get through the first episode of a show without being both bored and disgusted, it's not worth your time.",72970,3302,3303,1,This show is not I Repeat IS NOT FUNNY. It tries WAY to hard and falls flat on its unfunny face. It's about a Jewish family that's all uptight and nervous.I gave it two shows and gave up.

Nowhere told me that there would be nudity multiple times in the first episode alone. Would have a appreciated a heads up to that. Guess that's what makes a show good now-a-days.

I understand that means nothing to others, but for those who don't want to watch trashy content, I'm giving you a heads up!",72972,3304,3305,0,"Abounding in stereotypes, the whole show glosses over real issues of gender, class, and race under the not-so-subtle banner of a very one-dimensional, stereotypical brand of ""feminism.""

Something like ""my roommate was friendly and fat, haha I had someone to eat with and who wouldn't steal my boyfriend!""Immediately made me unlike the main character, and reminded me of the Gilmore Girls revival pool scene with the fat neighbor, Pat, was it? The Gimore pair was cringing at the sight of him in his bathing suit as they lounged and he made small talk. He seemed friendly too!So, I will pass. This might be funny for snots.",72974,3306,3307,0,"In a word, absurd. In two words, Politically Correct, or at least as politically correct as you could expect a Jack Ryan story to be. Jim Greer is a muslim. Who knew? Jack gets reluctantly forced into the field, and in one situation he shoots and kills a terrorist. It seems like he's about ready to cry, especially perplexing given his backstory as a United States Marine who had been deployed to Afghanistan. Then there are the subplots, the most nauseating one involving a drone pilot who has a crisis of conscience about ridding the world of murderous terrorists. Then he takes a few days off to travel to Syria to make amends to the father of one of his ""victims."" The stupidity doesn't end there, sadly. Even sadder is the fact that the cast is pretty solid, including a few very talented and respected actors. I was especially dismayed to see Abbie Cornish slumming in the role of Dr. Love Interest. She's better t;han this. The production values are very good, while the writing and stories are anything but. Kinda funny to laugh at, if you're in the mood, but more often than not it's just annoying to bear witness to the expedient depths to which the writers will sink, insulting the intelligence of the viewer and detaching from any sense of reality, in order to keep the plot rolling along. Definitely not worthy of the Tom Clancy name or of all the hype that preceded the premiere of the series.",72975,3307,3308,0,"It is shameful that this production is about 5-10% away from being stellar. It needed a few percentage points more in: Realism, Writing, and thus Money to bring it all together. That the production went on the cheap virtually destroyed the legacy of the late Mr. Clancy.Here are just a few examples where the tiniest bit of change would have made a tremendous difference:A US Army Huey flying into the Black Site? Come on. The US Army has none of these in inventory and if you found one somewhere on a TO&E, you wouldn't send it to a BLACK site.Oh, a BLACK site is named as such because it is off the books. We don't want anyone to know it is administered by the US so we have plausible deniability or at the minimum, can keep it secret. We also will not have US Soldiers stationed there as guards who are wearing big US (red, white, and blue) flags on their chests! Finally, if we had a military black site like this in the middle of nowhere (where apparently we pay bounties for terrorists we killed in our own drone strikes), we would have a defense in depth like you cannot imagine. This would include a long serpentine vehicle sally port so you know, the terrorists couldn't explode a car bomb up agains the gate to breach it. Since it happened at the Black Site, I will also mention that interrogating someone with 20 people in the room is beyond stupid, adds no value to the story line, and 2% of additional thought on this matter would have made for a better episode.A little bit more writing an realism would have had Greer firing Ryan for disobeying him on his first week in the job. Greer coulda rehired him back totally in line with the plot. However, let me assure you the CIA doesn't allow blatant insubordination of this type.A little bit more thought would have revealed that we didn't need to add to Jack's backstory and capability by making him active duty for 6 years and a combat veteran. There was much to be said that Tom Clancy had him injured during summer training while in college. Jack was JUST a civilian and NOT a combat veteran. He tried to serve in uniform but found his service out of uniform in civilian service to our nation. But, if you gotta change the story this way, at least promote the poor guy. To be a lieutenant after 6 years of active service makes him the worst officer in US Military History.I will ignore the tactics simply because this is 2018 and the public is oblivious to them. That said, Tom Clancy did not. You learned something you didn't know both tactically and strategically in every story he told. It is beyond belief that a bunch of terrorists could breach a heavily fortified Black Site with 5 Isuzu trucks, a VBIED, and a few nuclear tipped RPGs ... and then escape with their raid's objective. No pursuit? No drones or other aviation assets available? No QRF ready to help if crap goes sideways? No dynamically redirected Keyhole Satellite to keep an eye on the escaping terrorists?Yep, just a few percentage points away from greatness. You missed it by /-----/ much.This was after watching the first episode only. And, I was generous in my critique. If it gets better, I will amend my review.

As such he seems ok with the destruction of his work for profit.Greer as a cussing immoral Muslim is PC out of control. The story is so weak that we sat watching in pain predicting everything that happens in the story. There are occasional moments were this disaster ties the story back to things you already know based on books and movies, but they are very low key and very occasional. The drone operator story is even more anti-American PC nonsense and fits no where in the story just like the soft porn sex.All in all, an incredible failure!",72977,3309,3310,0,"When I saw a Tom Clancy series advertised on Amazon Prime months ago, I was so excited, I couldn't wait until it came out. I thought, finally, a great show I can watch that won't be full of nudity and sex! But no, my eyeballs were once again assalted against my will in episode 2, and when I read the reviews here, I found that it does, indeed, continue. This series is not true Tom Clancy's writing, and I don't even know who to be angry with. Did he give Hollywood permission for this? Why does Hollywood think everyone is okay with that? I'm finding more and more that there are so many people who are sick and tired of nudity and sex on t.v. every time we try to watch a show. So unbelievably disappointed.",72978,3310,3311,2,"First thing I noticed was the cursing. Totally unnecessary and makes the characters sound stupid.Second is the nudity. Also totally unnecessary... and there is one scene (so far) in episode three that makes no sense and only serves to make an Air Force drone pilot look bad.Third, the series deviates so far from the books and the movies that Tom Clancy must be rolling over in his grave in an attempt to push his way out so he can sue the producers of this garbage. For instance, Jack Ryan's character is supposed to be an analyst who has no desire to be a field man... so this whole ""wolf"" business is totally wrong. Him getting getting sent for by a helicopter, taking the CIA jet overseas (more than once) and riding helos into military compounds (that don't exist? Pure fantasy...) is so far out of Ryan's character that it makes it impossible to like the series.Unfortunately, it doesn't end there. Greer's character is going through a divorce, apparently. Oh, and he's a Muslim? Seriously? Because he converted for his wife? Oh... and he and Ryan don't get along. Greer doesn't know or trust Ryan (after three episodes, anyway). And Greer's being held back? This is so moronic and off track from the books (and movies) it's just plain frustrating to watch.I get the whole bit about wanting us to see things from two sides, but this is not presenting both sides. Some Hollywood lib who probably graduated with a degree from a California university in religious studies is probably the storyboard person or the screenwriter. America, bad (with a few exceptions)... Muslims good (with few exceptions). Please!I gave it three episodes and am extremely disappointed with the way the story has taken this hard left. I may watch more, but certainly won't binge. And I'll be FFwd through the trash.

I watched the first episode based on the high ratings in the reviews. It did not pull me in. I didn't find a single instance of humor funny. Gave it the benefit of the doubt and watched a second. Didn't help. The main characters have no chemistry. The premise that their lives got tangled based on a one-, excuse me, sixnightstands followed by pregnancy, is ridiculous. Also, opening the series with a sex scene, even though mild, is, in my view, poor in taste.",72981,3313,3314,1,"I watched the first season because it was something to do. Season 2 Episode 1 was hideously offensive. Animal abuse is unacceptable in any way, shape or form, and the whole dead dog routine, clearly cheaply aimed at being funny, was pushed, and pushed and pushed. It came off as animal abuse, made me loathe these two horrible human beings in the lead roles and gave the impression of an attempt to normalize adopting an animal then killing it for being inconvenient, which was the plan, before the dog was hit by a car and killed, instead, to the couple's relief. The corpse of the animal was subsequently inconvenient to these two dolts, and viewers are subjected to seeing the corpse of the dog several times--beating a dead horse storyline-wise, but also abusive to the viewer in the process. NOT FUNNY and insensitive to viewers who care about animals and/or have a moral compass. I will never, ever watch this insipid, mean-spirited show again, caution anyone with a heart or conscience not to watch it, or you'll be disturbed and upset as I was. I feel like I was blindsided by the content I was exposed to after watching the first season, which seemed okay for the most part. The writers and all involved in its production should be ashamed of themselves and have crossed a line, which is saying a lot, since a lot of content these days dances along the line of inappropriate ethically. I hope the show tanks and there is no season 3. How could you even publish this tripe on Prime, Amazon? Did any of the content decision makers ever pause for a moment to watch this episode before publishing? I'd think not. Very irresponsible and disrespectful to Prime viewers.

Consider 10+ hours (season 1) to develop what could be done by competent producers and directors in 3 hours; Amazon excels in the drag on and on genre. Blatantly missing is an intro statement ala Star Wars recapping the true historical events and then introducing the concept of 'what if?'. More worrisome is that poorly-read and history-ignorant viewers might actually not react to the vision presented of the ashes of incinerated (certainly while alive and breathing) mentally deficient, elderly and infirm people, spewing across the Midwestern countryside in real time....Folks, this production posits that those ashes also would include anyone not white as well as all Jews and their relatives in 1962 America because Nazi Germany, under Hitler, had a very specific agenda to purge society of 'undesirables'. Very unsavory. A most distressing concept, all in all. Not worthy of your valuable time.",72985,3317,3318,0,Watched first episode with my wife because she heard good reviews. She couldn't stay awake. I watched the first episode through. The episode does not stand on its own. Plot seemed to meander from one bad event to another without any clear purpose or end point. Strikes me as the sort of program where I might expect subplots to start tying together after several episodes but I was not drawn in. I think there are enough similar but more realistic programs with the same general theme that deal with post WWII Communism. 3rd Reich history with extermination and cremation of portions of the population was horrific enough; we don't need another fictional version of its continuation.,72986,3318,3319,0,"First a disclaimer: I have not read the Phillip K. Dick novel so this review is based solely on the ten-episode Season One of HIGH CASTLE. What I liked: beautiful photography though the early episodes stressed a dark mood where even in daylight there was little sun. The acting was the strongest point and I was surprised to learn that some of the ""American"" actors are in fact British. Some complained that the pacing was boring but I disagree. The pacing was deliberate and a relief from the technique where the editing requires a change of shot every five seconds. This frantic editing suggests to me that the filmmakers believe the viewers have an attention spam of a five year-old so if they don't keep things hopping constantly they will lose their audience. So my wife and I watched all ten episodes mainly thanks to these qualities.Now what I disliked: though the novel may clarify some story points, a film adaptation should stand on its own without the need for viewers to reference the novel to find out what's going on. I can accept the premise of the Axis Powers winning WWII for storytelling purpose, but we are left on our own to figure out how. In passing we hear that the atomic bomb was dropped on Washington, D.C. and that FDR was assassinated. I am willing to ""suspend my disbelief"" in the cause of fiction but the Germans were never at a point where such things were even on the drawing boards. It is well established that Hitler had no trans-oceanic ambitions, i.e., invading America, during his lifetime. But OK, I will happily suspend my disbelief for entertainment's sake. All I ask is that the tale proceed logically. It is this failure in logical storytelling that is HIGH CASTLE's biggest failure and the reason why I give it two stars.When an author needs to get his characters from one situation into another but doesn't know how to make this transition logically, he cheats. In other words, he just does it and leaves it to the reader or viewer to figure out how it happened. Without giving away any story points, I will just say that HIGH CASTLE has several such ""cheats"" and none worse than in the final scenes of episode 10. We see what happens but we don't know how or why it happens. Come on producers, you want us to watch and to suspend our disbelief. OK, fair enough. But don't insult your viewers by cheating in your storytelling because you can't figure out how to transition your characters to where you need them to be. I hesitate to spen dtime watching Season Two, if there is a Season Two.",72987,3319,3320,0,"So, The Man In The High Castle is set in an America that lost WW2.Â In the pilot, our main characters learn that there are two films that apparently show an America that WON the war, made by The Man In The High Castle.And immediately the questions raised for the audience and the leads are:Who is the Man In The High Castle?How did the films come to be made? Is it the work of special effects?Is there a way to go into that (our) world in which America won the war?Nicely done pilot.And then for the remainder of the season, no one wonders any of these things! WTF?!The promise made in the pilot is that this show will follow the protagonists as they try to learn who the Man In The High Castle is and the antagonists (the Japs and the Nazis) try to stop them, presumably to somehow stop the Â“America winningÂ” version of history from becoming a reality or at least to stop the films from being used as propaganda.But instead, what follows is muddled and pointless.By episode 9, no one is even a half step closer to finding the answers to the questions raised in the pilot. A lot of people seem to want to get these films, but we donÂ’t know why. Literally 75% of the series has nothing to do with the films.Finally in the last two minutes of episode 9, we see a portion of a film. It appears to show the future and one of the supporting characters dying. And again the dramatic questions are raised.And then more questions are raised in the final episode, but not by the protagonists because they are not privy to the same information as the audience is. They remain exactly where they were after the pilot, not an inch closer to finding the truth.The show is a striking misfire and a dreadful bore. Shocking really.Rufus Sewell, the main Nazi, could very well be the best actor on the little screen though.",72988,3320,3321,1,"I really wanted to like this, and if I'd known the source material, maybe I would have liked it, or at least better, but now we'll never know.Five episodes in and so far it makes no sense. If it is urgent that Frank show up for his factory job at the totalitarian world, why is his friend able to cover for him with no reprisals? DoesnÂ’t exactly help us believe in the high stakes of retribution/world closing in on him.Why would you have so relative little action between the Japanese and German overlord characters? Isn't this setup a prime conflict ground?FrankÂ’s friend says it is Â“urgentÂ” that Juliana get back to town Â– in 1962, mind; what does he want her to do - hope aboard a space satellite at Cape Carnaveral? Juliana is traveling somewhere in the wilds of small town open Americana, on the slow bus, and kicked off the bus in the middle of nowhere by Japanese soldiers Â– 2 minutes later she is arriving in her home town, no explanation as to how (unless I fell asleep and missed an episode Â– I really donÂ’t think I did), and the gaping prior bullet wound Frank had 2 minutes ago, is mysteriously 100% healed?This is ridiculous.

The show is so boring that I cannot keep my mind on it and thus the need to rewatch it and rewatch scenes. It is like reading a boring book that the school has assigned. I find my mind wandering to other things and then realizing that I missed the entire scene. I love Maggie Smith and her character is one of the few that can command my attention. There is nothing uplifting in the first five episodes. There is an unhappiness that is weaved throughout most of the characters... just when one thinks that something good/positive might happen, it gets ruined. I would not recommend this show unless you thrill at the emotional pain of others. Everyone seems stuck in their life and hating it. I get enough of that in reality.",72990,3322,3323,0,"Streamed on Amazon Prime ... between the poor acoustics and the strong British accents, it was unintelligible.

After a half hour or so, that issue became less and less noticeable. We had never previously experienced this sort of issue on Amazon Prime streaming video.

There is no complexity in this show - not in the characters or the plot. No surprises, no character development. Very 2-dimensional. Maybe millenials would appreciate it more than I do but I can't see what there is to like. It's a soap opera set in a law firm but don't expect to gain any insight into the world of law. The script is shallow, the characters are shallow, the dialogue is laden with sound bites from some strange sub-culture I am not familiar with. This show is nothing like LA Law and The Good Wife where you can be entertained AND learn something about the characters and the law. Does Suits even have a legal consultant? I can't imagine that any female Harvard lawyer would dare enter a courtroom looking like a these women do and I can't imagine any Harvard women being willing to work in this environment of sexual harassment. In Suits it all about the clothing, the hair, the cleavage and the sex. That said, they do it well. It's just not worth my time.

I love courtroom dramas, but what makes them interesting is that it's not a forgone conclusion who will win, or how. Not so with Suits. They will win. The awards will be astoundingly huge (e.g., a settlement for $400 million is shrugged off as 'normal'). I can take the lead character, Harvey, for only so many minutes before it gets to be too much.None of the other characters bring much - they are all paper cut outs.",72997,3329,3330,0,This show is honestly horrible.

Too bad. It felt like season 1 and 2 was lower budget, more of a quirky indy series. Then it got attention, bigger budget, more producers, etc. and they totally ruined the show starting season 3.

Lenore is 100% my favorite character, she's hilarious and powerful, I love her actress. Tanya's actress plays her character perfectly too.But I think there are too many bad elements weighing down the show to say that I really enjoyed it. When I first read the synopsis of this show, I expected it to be very progressive. I expected the protagonist to be dynamic, and to receive portrayals of his sex scenes with his clients that were genuinely sexy, sensual, and pleasing to the intended audience. But Ray is just an old, misogynist (and spoiler alert: transmisogynist) grump of a man who occasionally 'learns lessons' through his fuck-ups with women but never experiences any long term changes. He's manipulative, selfish, and entirely unappealing to listen to; I feel bad for all of his clients, having to deal with someone so unjustifiably into himself. All of the men in the show are unreliable, which I assume is an intended theme, but Ray's whole deal got real old real quick. Outside of a disappointing protagonist, the show falls short in its monotonous storyline. Ray gets a client, he and/or Tanya does something extremely inconsiderate, Lenore does something mean and unexpected, Ray gets jealous of Jason, every now and then Tanya creates problems for herself by talking to Charlie and kind of taking his advice...and then the show ended without any real resolutions.",73039,3376,3377,0,"Was an interesting plot but there was more nudity than we cared to see & will not watch the other episodes.

The product is so soft, the discs will not stay in place no matter how careful you try to close the case, and they wind up slipping out of the bottom. It's sort of like a fine grain Styrofoam. The sliding around smudges the discs, and leaves tiny specks of material clinging to them.The material is supposed to be environmentally friendly. That would be great if this were a disposable product, but who buys DVD sets and throws away the packaging?

For a show that PUT FOX ON THE MAP it deserves much better. Hey CBS, pay the sync fees for the original music and release all 10 seasons properly. This is totally unacceptable. It would be like putting out Miami Vice without Phil Collins music. In these types of shows the music is so integral to the stories and the subtext.

The whole series just didn't seem to come together and the dialogue bounced from being laughable to just plain painful.

In fact, no one emerged as a captivating character.I could not get the feeling that the details of life or worship or customs were anything but someone's supposition. And lastly, the violence seemed a substitute for good drama.

Did multiple readings for myself and the negativity was still there. Very upset with the descriptions of each card very vague and extremely negative.

The meanings cannot be intuited by the imagery, in most cases there really is nothing to hone in visually and where there is an image, it makes no sense with the correlating description in the book or with traditional meaning. It also seems that the author did not do extensive research in Tarot tradition, imagery, meanings and uses. Some of my favorite Tarot decks to work with are untraditional decks, this deck is not one of them. The Wild Unknown Tarot appears to be a vanity deck devoid of substance. Although nicely packaged the cards are poor quality and get stuck to each other when fanning them out. Don't waste your money on this poorly designed deck.

I am a professional reader and have used this deck for years. My decks wear out often and I have to replace them. I just opened a new deck (april 2016) and along with the new low price the quality is also low and awful. The cards are no longer glossy and much thinner than thy have ever been before. I am so upset. I don't know where I will be able to find the previous edition with more durable and glossier cards :(.,73065,3408,3409,1,"I've been dabbling around with the tarot for about 30 years. Had several standard Rider-Waite decks during that time..they are basically the go-to for learning tarot. Whether you continue to read with them after learning is personal choice, but the standard Rider-Waite is the best tool with which to learn. My old decks were in storage and disappeared, so I needed new ones when I got this most recent urge to take up tarot again.Generally speaking the coloring on the standard Rider-Waite from U.S. Games has always been a bit garish, but not offensively so, and you get used to it. You might even come to prefer it (I did), which is why I decided to buy this deck.Stupidly, I did not heed the warnings of the other one-star reviews with regards to the coloration of the current printing of the standard Rider Waite. This edition or whatever you want to call it is really, truly, fantastically horrible. The blues are particularly, offensively bright, distracting, and artificial. These cards are so ugly and weird-looking I can't even begin to contemplate trying to work with them. The woman in the Star trump looks like the old timey wrestler Dusty Rhodes, with his albino-blonde hair and orange spray tan. Just Plain Wrong.When I opened the shipping box the outer box the cards came in had no plastic on it, and had obviously already been opened, although the cards inside were shrink-wrapped in plastic. And to be clear, I did have to take the plastic off the actual deck to get to the true weirdness and ugliness inside, because the top card that shows through the deck shrink-wrap (The Magician) has only very little blue in it and none of the other truly odd coloring. That card (and that card alone) is relatively normal-looking. So when I took the deck out of the box, before opening the shrink-wrap and looking at the other cards, I assumed I'd gotten a satisfactory deck and the one-star reviews were probably aberrations. Not so!Bottom line: do yourself a favor and don't buy these, unless you want to pay five bucks return shipping for the privilege of abusing your retinas.A good alternative is the regular size Smith-Waite Centennial deck, although the coloring isn't as clear for beginners. Watch out for size, though...the Centennials that come in a tin are the same size as playing cards, so if you want a bigger ""standard size"" tarot deck get the Centennial without a tin.Another good learning tool is the Giant Rider-Waite. They're very big, almost too big to work with, but they're fun and good for studying the cards. I also rebought a jumbo deck and the coloring on those is fine. The good old standard.Whatever alternative you choose, just please do yourself a favor and stay away from these! I wish I'd heeded those other one-star reviews. Now I'm out five buck for return shipping. And maybe some eyedrops for retina abrasion.",73066,3409,3410,1,"The quality of this deck is not on par with the other two decks that I own. This deck feels and looks very flimsy. The cards are paper thin, the images are washed out and lack detail. My previous Rider deck was so much better, much thicker cards, way way more animated realistic print. Too bad I misplaced it and don't remeber where I bought it from. So far I dont have any desire to even hold that new deck. May return it, but it's just too much hassle. So it just sits there. Needless to say, I do NOT recommend this product.",73067,3411,3412,0,"While the spirit of this book is good, and some of the techniques given are useful, I found some things about it somewhat off-putting.For one thing, the style and language used in this book is a bit juvenile (with terms like ""willy-nilly"" or ""Lemme 'splain"" used periodically). Also, I found the examples of card interpretation in some scenarios to be off base. Finally, a Celtic cross layout is defined that does not match the traditional ordering. Top it off with a lot of advertising for a web site and the feeling of it being a course workbook written by a professor who ""can't do, so s/he teaches instead"" completes the let down feeling I received from this purchase.All of these things can be written off to the authors personal relationship with the tarot I suppose, however they seem to speak with a kind of general authority on the subject that was surprising to see, given some of the unusual card interpretations and non-standard spread ordering that should at least come with a caveat of ""this is what works for me, but is not the 'traditional' way"".",73068,3412,3413,0,"I received the book with high expectations last year and despite my eagerness to read it all at once, I stepped back, took a deep breath and spent all those months reading it carefully page by page, while testing what is being suggested inside with the help of 2 very good friends who also own the book and are professional psychic readers.
First Glance:
-I have to admit that the cover design is one of the most successful ones in the market. The simplicity of the black color and the beige logotype of the initials Â“ATSÂ” make the book easily recognizable anywhere on the shelves of a bookstore.
-The layout of the content is also very well-presented. The book is divided in 5 basic parts plus the Appendices at the last part of the book.
1)New Exercises. This is the first section of the book that introduces a variety of exercises for tarot students. Each exercise consists of the following sub-heads: Â“Name of the exercise, Why is this important?, How to do it, Examples, Practice, Self-testing, Lesson Summary, Also see..Â”.
2)New Games. The second section follows a similar format as described above : Â“Title, Why is this important? Basics of the game, How to play, Tips, Lesson Summary.
I decided to include both sections as one Â“big chapterÂ” in my review because they are so similar to each other and my remarks apply invariably.
The biggest turn-off I had was that 90% of the games and exercises were already introduced with a different Â“titleÂ” or Â“formatÂ” in the authorÂ’s previous book Â“The Easiest Way to Learn the Tarot-EVER!!!Â” (the author himself quotes pages and exercises over and over again from his previous book). By default, this already makes the majority of the content extremely basic.
Moreover, most exercises and games promote certain habits that I do not appreciate in card-reading such as chaotic brainstorming and combining random cards together in an inconsistent manner (i.e. free association).
To support this, I will quote a few words by the author:
p.3 Â“3 of cups-sidekick card, with 5 of wands-dominant: I am a male stripperÂ”.
p.4 Â“There are no set formulas you can followÂ”
p.2 Â“Blend the two cards together to form hypothetical meaningsÂ”.
Hypothetical meanings cannot save the professional reader during a real-life session with a paying client. Unfortunately, intuition cannot be at its peak every single day and readers need formulas to back up their practice and professionalism.
However, there are very few exercises (3) that might help the complete amateur. One of them is the Â“Noun, Verb, AdjectiveÂ” p.9-22, in which a big list of Â“potential connotationsÂ” is given and the student needs to review the deck and correlate the meanings with the cards.
That could also be applied not only in Tarot but other decks as well and could be valuable when one would like to expand their vocabulary in readings and/or simply review the definitions.
For me there was nothing new in the first 80 pages of the book. Even the so-called Â“DianaÂ’s exerciseÂ” which was influenced by Russian esoteric forums was not something innovative for me, as I have already practiced these type of inquiries while in Russia a few years ago.
3 + 4) Advanced Spread Basics + Spread Techniques.
This Â“big chapterÂ” starts with a very interesting statement by the author: Â“I firmly believe his (WaiteÂ’s) version of the Celtic Cross spread, like his vision of the Tarot, is deeply flawedÂ”. And I found myself contemplating on the idea, whether this book was written by the same or different authors.
First of all because of the aforementioned statement, which is contradictory to Â“Art makes the TarotÂ”, p.71 (since WaiteÂ’s tarot is flawed, so is the art in the cards, which consequently makes the Â“face valueÂ” approach of meanings-that relies explicitly on the art-inaccurate).
Secondly, because during the exercises part of the book, the author promotes the Â“random one-two-three card spreadsÂ”(also called Â“blob spreadsÂ” in the book) as a very good way to develop intuition and reading skills, but suddenly on page 83 we read: Â“you should avoid blob spreads whenever possible.Â” And further Â“ Â…You have less information to work with. This means your answer will be more vague and make the client end up filling in the details themselves. This is unacceptable.Â”
And there are more contradictions to all the above:
p.92 Â“The Tarot is the best tool to date for developing your intuition..Â”
p.95 Â“Your answer will almost always be general and vague. ThatÂ’s okay at this point..Â”
etc.
One thing that was ethically unacceptable is written on page 101 Â“After relaxing her (the client), and yourself, you chat with her a bit and get some background information..Â”.
Supposedly, this is what psychic readers are paid for. No client is obliged to tell anything to the reader except the minimum basics: Â“A name and a specific question, if anyÂ”. The reader must reveal any background info in order to build a strong bridge between the two parties.
In general, I have to say that this section could have been rather interesting if it was truly written for advanced students-readers. Unfortunately, the reader strictly gives only 6 pages on how to break down a Celtic Cross with its Â“basic mini-spreadsÂ”. The modification of the spreads, plus the Â“verificationÂ” process, clarification cards falls into the category Â“cartomancy 101Â”. The most disappointing part is that there is no actual demonstration with real case studies.
However, I have to admit that if one wants to master the Celtic Cross, DustyÂ’s version is a really interesting one to study.
Though, unfortunately as a spread, the Celtic Cross cannot serve 15-minute readings either face-to-face or by phone. But that is another story and it has nothing to do with the book.
5)Fun Things
In this last section, the author provides suggestion on other applications one can experiment with using the Tarot. For example, dowsing, manifestation, designing your own spread/deck, brainstorming, problem solving etc.
Unfortunately, in most cases, there is not even a specific demonstration included, apart from vague suggestions like :
p. 129 Â“know your spreadsÂ…shuffling, asking, and drawing cards as needed until you get a solid Â“hitÂ”.Â”
The only practical example is provided on pages 147-155, where the author explains a specific case in detail with regards to the roundabout spread (you should check his first book for more information on this spread per se).
Additionally, he introduces in a very simple and understandable language the idea of planetary associations (e.g. polarities etc) in the roundabout spread, which is basically the astrological wheel layout.
This is indeed the only Â“advancedÂ” topic I read in the book, because astrology is not a field that everyone can comprehend easily, especially when they are not familiar with the subject. But I have to admit that Dusty succeeds in explaining the basics for his Â“style of readingÂ”.
The book ends up with a few pages, called Â“AppendicesÂ” with relative references to other sources and a few more info.
On a final note, I expected a lot more from a book called Â“Advanced Tarot SecretsÂ”. I was rather disappointed as there is a lot of data missing from such a manual. To name a few: how to approach specific inquiries with clear examples, and showcase with real case studies how to modify a spread, specific and advanced meanings for all cards that can be applied to intricate inquiries (e.g. business and investments, sexuality and relationships, etc.), as well as how and which ones to use as significators for most basic questions. Of course, I understand that it is not possible to say all in a single volume, but a lot of things could have been introduced for the advanced students.
Final verdict: I liked the author, not the work..",73069,3413,3414,1,"Didn't like the book or the author's method of writing. I would give this book a -5 stars if possible.

Not what I expected.I get the different ways to look at the cards .... but aside all that, I was expecting Dusty go a bit deeper into the meaning of each card (not necessarily give ""key phrases"", but really explore the cards like he does on his videos.So unfortunately, I'm disappointed.",73071,3415,3416,0,"Tarot deck cards usually have enough imagery and visuals so you know what the card means just by looking at it. The visuals are supposed to touch you mentally, spiritually and in all the ways that will help you give proper readings using your perceptive senses. The cards, visually, are very bland. The most expressive card in the deck seems to be the Joker. This is the card I saw when I decided to purchase the deck. I don't like the deck at all. Sorry for the bad review.",73072,3416,3417,1,I have several other tarot card decks and thought this one would be a nice addition however. I'm not a fan of them at all. All of the swords are extremely dramatic and could scare people who are receiving a reading and don't know how to read the cards. I wouldn't recommend this deck for a beginner. The cards also have a melancholy vibe about them. It kind makes the readings feel somber even if there is good news. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase them.,73073,3417,3418,0,"The art is beautiful and I was really excited about this deck, but the Strength card is... well, it's unsettling.

Really poor materials, it's not worth the price.",73076,3420,3421,0,"I am not happy at all with this deck. They are totally different now. I don't know why the cards are not laminated anymore. This is my third set of the universal Waite tarot deck. This first time was years ago and they were very pretty. The colors stood out and they were laminated. I ordered again this year, but from Amazon. Those cards were just like the deck I got today just ugly. They are so thin and rough.

Now I don't mind a certain paleness. But please, there is absolutely no focus whatsoever in the cards. It looks like a really bad scan to me, with all details gone.

The first is the Crystal Visions Tarot, that was a few weeks ago, and now this deck. Both decks have been a huge disappointment. These cards are shedding paper bits like nobody's business. It is so bad that it leave a film on the deck and on your hands when you handle them. It is hard to see, but you feel it, and it feels like that layer of ink and paper bits you get on your fingers when you read a newspaper. I literally have to wash my hands every time I touch these decks. I am so disappointed. The first deck I just thought was a fluke and maybe I got a bad batch. However, getting this deck and being confronted with the same problem with a completely different deck than the first one shows me that this is not a one time thing, and it is not a deck issue.

What a disappointment!!! I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviews about the grey print. Tell me, who prints a book in grey ink? Also, the top edge of the book has this uneven ink edge that gives it the effect of ink being spilled at the top. Supposedly it was a design. Sorry, but it's just plain STUPID!!! I worked in the printing business for a short time and I never encountered anything like this. The pictures of the cards are also blurry and difficult to distinguish the various symbols. I sent an email to Brigit Esselmont via her website to complain about the absolutely poor quality of the book. She did respond via a video apology saying that she was sorry, but it was all Amazon's fault. I think that is very disingenuous and misleading. I know for a fact that publishers send proofs to the book's author to be looked at and authorized. My personal opinion is that Esselmont or whoever she chose to oversee the publishing either didn't really look at the proofs or just didn't care. I think they just approved it in order to meet a deadline and just chose to publish it with all it's faults. This is really the worst print job I have ever seen.

BUT the book is really, really hard to read. It looks like a copy of a book. As a designer, I can see that it was a design flaw combined with a poor print quality. The designer used a sans serif light font, which by itself would be more problematic to read in a printed book size. Add to it, a printer with low quality ink and you will have this book. Maybe it was a matter of using the same design of the ebook. I haven't seen the ebook, I am just guessing. If so, then this was the mistake. This book NEEDS URGENTLY to be redesigned for print and then reprinted. I am sending mine back to Amazon, hoping I will get a better/darker one as replacement. If not, I will ask for a refund.",73083,3427,3428,0,I was disappointed in the book as the print was very light and hard to read and pictures were in black and white instead of colour as was the description of book. I returned it ok with only to receive the same copy back. I tried to contact author and said it only ;depends on where amazon got the book from. It cost me over $170.00 to return and final cost if I was to return it again allowing for au to us $. ie $43.00 au to send the book back. I have contacted Amazon only to say thanks for the feed back.

Not being able to even read it because of poor font and and print? Thin, crappy paper? Causing people headaches? I've never heard those problems about a book before!

This is the first time I have reviewed a book in my 15+ years of buying books from Amazon and I am very upset. The book is dull, very, very dull. So dull that some of the pages seem to have been printed in draft mode in a cheap printer. Just look at the photos I have included in this review. Additionally, it came with a teared page and the book suffers from poor editing (page 437) a header is in one page while its content is in the next page. The font selection for this book was terrible because the font is very thin so, adding the problem of poor printing, I have to read the book 3 inches from my face!! Otherwise, it is just a big gray blur at normal reading distance.Regarding the content, I appreciate that the author added an interpretation for each card from the different questions a client may ask in a reading i.e. career, work, health and adds personality types and suggested cards interpretations but, there are many free websites that offer the same or better information and in a ""legible"" manner.Don't get me wrong, I was expecting to have this book in my hands the minute it appeared on Amazon given the impression I had from the author's website which is aesthetically very nice as well as the information it provides.But, the book is the INVERTED meaning of the Website.Dusty White's Tarot books are the best. Do not spend money and time in this book!",73086,3430,3431,0,"I was so excited to receive this deck after pre-ordering it back in early June. It was frustrating to hear from friends who just ordered it this week on a whim that they received theirs before me but I finally got mine today.What a strange disappointment. While the art of Ravynne is undeniably beautiful, the production quality is inexplicably poor. And I mean that literally - I can't explain some of these issues logically:1. I opened the shrink wrapped sturdy outer box to find the inner box corners mysteriously ripped/crushed and all of the card corners bent.2. The card stock is VERY thin (I don't know what kind of decks these other reviewers are used to using but these would NOT hold up very long to regular readings). This would explain not only the bent corners in the cutting process but also some cards having creases in them toward the top - probably indentations from misaligned cards in the production process (yes, that's how thin the card stock is).3. The lack of any design on the back, other than a thin yellow line, makes the completely misaligned trimming job all the more obvious. The margins on one side are much bigger than the other on quite a number of the cards.4. There are also some cards that have a weird problem with the black finish that makes them appear to have grey spots and you can also feel rough patches on some of the cards amidst the ostensibly completely slick finish on both sides.5. Most perplexing of all is that a handful of cards *in the middle of the deck* had really bad water damage along the bottom (some, all the way up through the very large titles)! I have no earthly idea how this could happen prior to packaging/quality control.I know Blue Angel Publishing usually has good quality decks with very different card stock, but they've obviously used a different printer this time and it's really bad.It's also a shame because this is a lovely deck and I know that Ravynne Phelan has been working on this project for many years to bring it to fruition :(...5 stars for Ravynne's art, 0 stars for the production quality.",73087,3431,3432,0,"While the artwork is amazing, I agree with another reviewer that the card descriptions (which are necessary) are highly sexist. Also, I don't need a deck telling me to ""do onto others as you would have them do onto you"" and ""have faith that everything happens for a reason"". I think it's a shame all that beautiful artwork was wasted on the equivalent of Sunday school lessons.",73088,3432,3433,0,"There are pros and cons to this deck and I'm going to start out with the negatives.- The cardstock and ultra gloss finish are awful. The cards feel cheap and almost repulsive. They also don't fit right in my hands, being wider than most decks, which makes them unwieldy. The cards came new but with chipped white corners on many of them, leaving me to believe that there's a white layer under the black.- The artist/author has some extremely dated and at some points offensive beliefs that she attempts to hammer home far too frequently. (See photos.) For a deck made for ""a new era"", she sure relies heavily on rhetoric dating back quite a ways. Examples: on multiple pages (and I'm less than halfway through the guidebook right now) she states ""there is only one race, the human race"". This alone is totally cringe-worthy. Firstly because it's factually incorrect from a purely objective standpoint. Humans are a species, not a race. Secondly, this point of view encourages erasure of the perspectives of People of Color. PoC lack the privilege whiteness affords. They don't get to be ""colorblind"". They see their skin tone reflected back at them in the expressions and mannerisms of everyone they encounter. They are acutely aware of being othered and denying that is an act of censure. Colorblindness doesn't erase racism, it erases the lived experiences of humans who don't get to play make-believe. Now, I know there is a school of thought dating back to the boomers in which colorblindness and this type of language are encouraged in an attempt to be more inclusive. Perhaps the author falls into this category of people. It is important to keep in mind that impact is greater than intent. ""The best of intentions"" and all that. It doesn't matter what she thinks she was trying to convey, what matters is whether or not she listens to people with valid complaints and whether or not she invites PoC to the proverbial table. Phrasing matters.- Another example of weirdness and possible delusional thinking is highlighted in the second two photos. She trash talks ""the media"" (which, to be fair, is too broad a term) and says this, ""in fact, much of [the media] is complete fabrication designed to influence you to believe what they tell you. A little bit of truth is hidden within the lies so that we will focus upon that thread of truth..."" This is a very skewed statement and does a disservice to journalists and actual news publications. She is right about one thing, though; there is a kernel of truth in that lie. A lot of media providers seek ratings and profits. To achieve these, they sensationalize a lot. They want to hook people with headlines. Even local news channels are utilizing clickbait tactics now and some national news organizations pander to their audience. That does not mean it's all a lie or that there is this giant ""sheep"" conspiracy (the belief that the government is out to get you and wants to turn the people into sheep to keep them under control).Positives:- The imagery is gorgeous. She is a skilled artist.Something about this deck just makes it the hardest of mine to read, so I'm going card by card through the guidebook. It's not resonating with me as well as I'd like and the deviation from the traditional RWS format makes it quite challenging for a Tarot beginner.I wanted to like this deck, I really did, but it's so hard to connect with it when the artist and author have such limited beliefs combined with the inferior print quality. At this price point, I expected more. I get a lot more enjoyment out of my indie Luna Sol deck and even my Llewellyn Shadowscapes one. I feel like flipping through these and reading the book is a chore I won't quit, because I spent money on this. The guidebook is almost too big, too. It's physically short enough to fit in a velour tarot bag of it's own, but it's so verbose. That's good and bad, but for someone who's just trying to trudge through it (""uphill and in the snow!"") it becomes very tedious.If I want to draw a card and get fuzzy feelings and immediately intuit the meanings, I choose the Luna Sol. If I want a challenge, I choose Shadowscapes. If I want a headache, I pull out the Dreams of Gaia. (Believe me, writing that makes me sad, too!).",73089,3433,3434,0,I want to love this deck. The artwork is amazing and the guidebook is well written. The cards stock is horrible though. The cards stick and are so thin. After just a couple days of using them for personal readings the cards are already showing wear. I really wish they could be reprinted because like I said the artwork is amazing and I think I could really connect with the deck. Very disappointed!,73090,3434,3435,2,"First card I pulled was ""The Father"". The book reads (from memory, as I have since removed the deck from my home), ""The father is very much the centre core of power of the family."" Enough said, I am not interested in reading anything more by this ""author"".Additionally, not all the cards have titles on them, just an obscure image of a person usually, making it difficult to do any sort of quick or overview/pattern readings without referring to the sexist book.",73091,3435,3436,0,"The first thing I noticed when I opened this deck was that they came out of order, any Tarot deck I have bought ever has come in order , this deck started with 8 of Wands and went in no order, the cards looked like they had been shuffled already. They had Chinese writing on everything and all the cards, it did come in English but I didn't want to see the Chinese writing on my cards. The cool color was just OK. I do however like the smaller size of this deck and the quality of the cardstock was fine. I am returning the deck. I would of kept it if it weren't for the Chinese writing all over the cards.",73092,3436,3437,1,"You all. These are TERRIBLE. They are so small you can barely hold them. Cheap they were tearing and the edges were peeling. And even the cards themselves were faced all different directions, so they didnÂ’t get taken care of even at the manufacture levels.

When I opened the box and looked at the cards. Disappointed they were a little narrow and thin. They feel cheep. I knew if I used them it be a very short matter of time they would be ragedy and worn. Decently NOT worth almost $15. They have a lot of nerve charging that price. Ha more like 6 7 or 8 dollers would be fitting.

They had to be put in order to even know if all cards were present. And, nope! Both decks missing cards. The first deck received had 77 cards... no Star card. The second deck had 78 ... but two Hanged Man cards but no Lovers card.This is an open forum, so the best I can do is reduce all I have to say about these cards AND the manufacturer/packager/seller (most pointedly and directed to the manufacturer/packager/seller) is PATHETIC.Flimsy material.

In interest of full disclosure, am I not the world's biggest fan of this deck but that being said, US Games has done a terrible disservice to these keys. Although the image quality varies from card to card, the pixelation and fuzzy scans are just inexcusable as they greatly diminish from the art work of the cards themselves.

It's a shame that a deck that has so much to offer would be subject to such poor production values.",73097,3441,3442,2,"The re-printing of this beautiful Tarot deck is utter rubbish. The amazingly intricate drawings of Godfrey Dowson have been blurred and pixilated to an embarrassing degree. Also, the cards themselves were cut irregularly, so no two cards were even uniformly shaped. Seriously, I could go down to Kinkos and make better replications of these cards! In this day and age of technology there is no excuse for blurry pixilation and irregularly cut cards. If you think that you are getting the inspiring original printing of these cards, you will be sadly mistaken.I've contacted U.S. Games Systems and they have ignored me. I tried to warn customers on their site but they didn't post my review. If I were to speculate, I would think that they are trying to retain the inflated value of the original printing by releasing a disgustingly low quality representation in their latest re-printing at the expense of you, the customer. Buyer beware.Update: I have posted two pictures which capture the quality issues I mention; one of the poorly clipped corner and one of flagrant pixelation. Please note that this pixelation is not due to my scanner but is an exact replica of the shoddy quality. In the original printing, these lines were razor sharp and clean. They are now a blurry mess.

I had the original printing from the 80's and had given it to a friend never to be seen again. The images are fantastic and filled with symbolism. However, this edition was so poorly executed I actually gave the cards away after I received them. The printing was so off on the images it almost looked like the images were out of focus some cards were worse than others but the pixelation was too much for me...Then again the price of the cards was not high. So if you had the original and get this one I feel you may be unsatisfied. If you never had them and want a copy go for it for the price. I'm going to try and find a used copy on line they are not cheap for the original.",73099,3443,3444,0,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here. Many of the card images are pixelated.I bought a tarot deck both for research and use purposes and I chose this one because it seemed highly recognized and regarded -- and, from the samples, I thought the pictures were wonderful.However, not all the cards have the same quality art as others. I am not sure why that is. I am not talking about pixelation here I am talking about the actual drawings. Some are excellent, while some look very sloppily drawn. Not sure if Godfrey Dowson got tired after a while or what.On top of that, at least two of the cards contain satanic symbols (inverted Pentagram and the head of a goat).

The cost is not significant but that had the author been more up front with the WHOLE package. There are 2 kinds of people who want Tarot - those that don't want to delve deeply into the origin and process and those that want a simplified version. Maybe it should have been been put out there in 2 versions and let the buyer decide if they want to learn more about the process of reading Tarot.,73114,3461,3462,1,"This app is actually pretty great.

It is a thoughtful and gorgeous reproduction of a classic tarot design. The cardstock is good quality and very thick, and the tin to store the cards is a welcome and attractive accessory. Now the bad: as the description states (but only at the VERY END, and I unfortunately didn't see it) this is a very small ""pocket size"" deck. I was a little bemused when I opened my package and saw the tiny tin, but wasn't immediately discouraged. However once I opened them and held them in my hands and attempted to work with them, I was very disappointed. This is a 78-card deck that is very small and it is pretty much impossible to properly shuffle them.

They were small, probably the size of standard playing cards, and incredibly classy which made it hard for me to shuffle them.

So let me be precise: this is the smaller deck that comes in a tin. Well, it was just so awful I returned it straight away. Unless you want these cards to put in a album or hang on a wall as display, they will fall apart in five minutes. I shuffled them only once and the top part started to come off the backing. I am incensed with US Games System for having their cards made in China now. ALL Chinese products are inferior quality and often even toxic. I got a friend to buy me the bigger version of this deck, still made in China, sadly, and still quite flimsy, but more resistent. I will only use them for back-up of my much older RWS deck which has been shuffled and used a million times and is still doing very well.",73119,3468,3469,0,"When I bought this, I presumed because it was a centennial edition in a tin it was a deluxe deck.

However, this book is lacking in everything one needs to determine the meanings of the cards or the images particular to this deck. I can't figure out why on earth this book is so expensive. If it's not lined in gold, there's just no reason to spend this kind of money on this overly simplistic paperback. I gave mine away to a thrift store because it was useless to me.

But then I excitedly unwrapped the cards from the plastic and realized there was one part of this deck that was not so great. The card stock for the actual cards. It is thin and feels so fragile and easy to bend. I cannot imagine using these regularly, or even just sometimes. The idea of shuffling them is unnerving because they are basically printed on a step above a sheet of paper. My business cards are thicker card stock than these! And it is so sad because they are beautiful and I love the artwork, the book and the box. But the cards are not at all for everyday, they are far too thin and delicate for regular use of any kind. I was very disapointed, which sucks because they really made me happy art and style wise. I just don't understand why anyone would print their deck like this! If there is a reprint on higher quality card stock i would immediately purchase them.",73127,3476,3477,1,"Summary: I'm so in love with this tarot deck -- EXCEPT that it just features white witches. This is not a little thing. This is a big, big problem. There was zero reason to do that. I'm hoping they'll have an updated edition soon to improve that.-------I love the feel & tone of this deck. Cats are in every image, most of the cards contain broomsticks, pointy black hats & striped leggings. It's the perfect witchy deck for those of us witches who love our Halloween-esque aesthetics 24/7 (I am one of those -- I'd have my garlands out year-round if my housemates would let me).Elisabeth Alba is an exceptional illustrator. Every card is so finely inked and painted that it's quickly become my favorite deck to look at -- and to use! Deborah Blake and Alba's interpretations on the traditional RW are spot-on (for example, the Hermit is a witch in the woods around a bonfire, surrounded by woodland creatures peering out of the dark). Blake's book is funny, insightful, and on-point, and even though I've been reading the cards for many years, I've learned a lot from this book. Design, witchy tone / feel, and book are all great.However, there's a BIG caveat that unfortunately overshadow all my other feelings about this deck. There are almost no people of color in this deck (there are a few cards that are just sliiiiightly ambiguous). Why?!??!?!!?!??! Why why why why why why why why WHYYYYY???? Our witchy community is so much bigger than this!! We should be better than this & more aware by now.Every time I use these cards, my heart breaks a little because I just don't understand how & why the creators could so blatantly overlook and ignore so many of our kindred witches. It seems like a glaring oversight (and I'm hoping it's just that, rather than a deliberate whitewashing choice). Not all witches are white. Not all clients are white. Plenty of people of all colors wear striped stockings and use wands and have cats and cast spells. C'mon, people!! This deck was supposed to be better than that, yet it's just another deck for (exclusively) white witches. **I'm a white witch. And I don't want any more all-white decks.** They are exclusionary and continue an age-old legacy of ignoring & erasing our fellow witches when they're people of color, and we cannot continue that legacy any more.What makes it even more confusing is that the creators of the deck even made special efforts to be diverse & inclusive, but **only** when it comes to gender & queerness. Some characters are male witches, and some are even gender-ambiguous (Blake mentions this very fact in the accompanying book), which I whole-heartedly applaud. I'm a queer witch, so that's awesome. However, this makes it even more painful to realize that, while the creators thought through *some* aspects of diversity, they ignored race.There are maybe 5-10 cards that aren't pearly peachy lily white, so could potentially represent witches of color, but I have to wonder:a) Why are there so few of these cards?b) Why didn't the illustrators make them more obvious? All of the other cards have characters of *obvious* caucasian descent, so why aren't there witches here of obvious Asian, African, Native American, Latin American, etc. descent?c) How could they not even think this through for the Hierophant card? This card features three witches practicing yoga -- and, you guessed it -- all of them, *including* the lead yogi, are white. Not even the teacher herself is of Indian descent. They are allllll white. Gag me.It makes me sad to think that, as witches, we all still have so far to go. We are better than this. Our community is bigger & wider than this. We have an OBLIGATION to ourselves & to each other to be more inclusive, representative, and loving. Why are we still seeing so many exclusively-white decks out there?! This design practice totally erases entire groups of people, and is a slap in the face to so many people in our community. It also makes this deck really hard to read with, professionally, because many of my clients and friends are people and women of color.I'm hoping Alba & Blake will release a new edition of this deck that incorporates MANY MANY MANY more obvious women of color. Sure, keep in some ethnically-ambiguous cards, too! I'm not saying that's a bad thing. But it's so far from being enough that it's frankly insulting. If they come out with a new version that's more open & loving & inclusive & respectful of our wider community, I'd buy it in a heartbeat -- and then buy one for every witch I know. That's how good the deck is and *could be* once it's updated to be more representative of our fellow witches of color.",73128,3477,3478,2,"The card stock is horrible! It's flimsy, thin paper.

It came in today and I have to say IÂ’m pretty disappointed. The cardstock isnÂ’t anything like her deck at all.

I knew that going in but didn't take it too seriously. I figure that as long as I can shuffle the deck it's fine if they get a little bent. The more ""used"" the more imbued with my energy they'll be. But this deck is truly sad. The first time I shuffled cards were catching on each other and pulling at their edges. After only one reading the tops and bottoms of half the cards were already nicked and dented. They are so, so thin. Put two pieces of standard printer paper together and that's the thickness of each card, though they are slightly sturdier than plain paper. This gets two stars simply for the artwork.

It's even ouchier in this case, because I love Kim Krans work so much. Alas, I've completely given up on this otherwise half-assed deck, and every time I pull from the Animal Oracle Deck I love, I am reminded to post this review so that no one else wastes their money thinking they're going to get a solid, well-flushed out divination tool. The main problem with this deck - well, actually it's the accompanying guidebook that's the primary issue - is that it's written from an extremely subjective lens of perception. The author doesn't acknowledge both the gifts and the shadows fundamentally laden within each animal totem, rather she skews the descriptions based on her own experience or point of view, which makes for a very lopsided deck, and definitely muddles the clarity it supposedly transmits. It definitely seems like Krans has a very limited understanding of the animal spirits, and of the larger metaphysical truth that renders even the shadowiest of archetypes bearers of great blessings. As beautiful as this deck is drawn, I find it utterly useless for any real 5D insight because of all these aforementioned shortcomings. Apologies to Kim for not being more positive, but I feel beholden to the larger truths, and to my fellow consumers who might not be budgeted for decks that don't deliver.

Just knowing basic meanings, ends up in becoming confusing interpretations.",73143,3493,3494,0,"I received a defective Good Tarot deck and I'm very unhappy with my purchase. Most cards were misprinted and uneven on all four sides. The inside of the box had dark scuff marks. There was peeling along the edges of the cards. I can see why some reviews had noted that this type of card stock would not hold up with normal use. The deck is extremely thick, the cards stick together because of the sticky glossy laminate finish and the cards are so large that it is not functional. This deck is so big and bulky that it is impossible to hold comfortably or to shuffle. The artwork is ok. I do not like that most of the women depicted in the major arcana and suit cards such as the High Priestess and Empress look like teenage girls. Like other reviews have mentioned, there isn't a lot of detail in the background at all and most images do not make sense in relationship to the card title/meaning. This is in no way a functional tarot deck. This is an oracle deck that the author intended to be used for one to three card readings. The guidebook is very hard to read because the font is very small and strains the eyes. There are several typos and misprints in the guidebook. The word ""God"" and ""Spirit"" are mixed up in the guidebook descriptions. If this is going to be a divination system for all faiths to use, maybe ""The Divine or The Universe"" would have been a better choice of words. Not everyone resonates with the word ""God"". There are no traditional meanings given for the cards so it is very confusing for newer cards to be interpreted such as ""Temptation, Call, Transformation ect."" There isn't enough detail in any of the cards for your intuition to pick up on either. The short affirmations on each cards are very airy fairy new age in tone and not practical sage advice to really help anyone. I also didn't care for the first person language used in the affirmations. This makes it very difficult if you wanted to perform a reading for another person. I just can't see how this deck can be helpful or offer anyone deeper insight into their lives. I really wanted to love this deck and I've been wanting it for a very long time but it was nothing like I expected. Even though this deck is positive in nature, it is lacking in so many ways. Overall the Good Tarot is a huge disappointment and definitely not worth all the hype. Hay House also needs to work on quality control issues with their printing and processing methods.",73144,3494,3495,0,"This is VERY disappointing. It is certainly lovely artwork (thus two stars). It is NOT Tarot. Goodness separated from challenge is impractical, unrealistic, and meaningless - like knitting without the yarn. Our challenges & adversity lead us to growth & the development of our abilities, self-discovery, and potentials. Colette knows this as is evident in her booklet - even she cannot remove this deck entirely from adversity despite her efforts. Tarot is objective, neutral - good & bad lie within people's perspectives & fear is born of ignorance. There is nothing to fear in true Tarot. The symbology here is random and nebulous at best, by & large limited in the extreme. While lovely the images are unclear, hazy - even with a magnifying glass. Thus the Major Arcana has lost its potency entirety. What has a woman looking away from the reader have to do with patience? What on earth is the significance of a giraffe here? Without the booklet to explain each card, one is challenged to find any correlation between the card's image and meaning in either arcana. And reducing the suits to simple elements completely removes the full significance and vast depth the suits are designed to convey. So goes the broad psychological value and insightful clarity of the lesser arcana. Again there is little to no symbology to guide or feed the intuition on any card. What remains is make believe. By her own admission, this is simply another of Colette's oracle decks, and I expected much better from her. I honor her intention, but the result is sadly lacking. I wonder at her understanding of the true philosophy of Tarot?

This is my take on this deck. There has been WAY TOO MUCH liscence taken with the symbolism without anything taking its place. I was SOOOO looking forward to this deck- hopeful that this newly illustrated version would be an elevated version of the Ryder-Wait deck but instead it is just a bunch of pretty useless pictures I am sad to say. If you are new to reading stay away from this deck and buy yourself some version of the Ryder deck.

It could be having a basic noise cancellation function but it does not have a hybrid mic outside as advertised in the listing. In fact, the packing box also does not mention about the hybrid technology anywhere. Please do not spend this much money on this poor quality item. I have tested it for a few days and had to return it as I was highly dissatisfied.",73153,3504,3505,0,"If I had paid more than $45 I would have been quite upset. How these have such high reviews is beyond me... Fake reviews? I'm considering sending them back shelling out real money for real headphones.These remind me of beats... Just muddy sounding. No crisp or clear sounds. It's noticeably bad. But hey, they're well under 100 bucks so....?? Don't listen to the reviews saying they're similar to bose or Sony... These are not even close to the same category.updateYeah, I sent these back. Couldn't justify even spending $40 on muddy sounding headphones. Bad audio drives me insane.

I tried listening to music and a white noise fan sleep aid app through these and, without having the volume at a near-uncomfortable level, I could still hear someone speaking to me just fine. I could also still hear a blender about 20 feet away. A plane cabin can be far louder than a blender, so good freaking luck! Speech and the blender were cancelled if I turned up the volume to about 60% of max, but again, that was too loud for me. Thoroughly unimpressed. And IÂ’d like to add that this was my first purchase of any noise canceling device, so IÂ’m not comparing it to anything else.",73155,3506,3507,0,I purchased these to help reduce noise on airplane flights and listen to music/watch videos. The build quality is actually impressive for the price although a bit on the heavy side. The sound quality however was terrible and was tinny highs and overly emphasized bass to the point of it being muddy. The noise cancellation does not cut the back seat test in the Boeing 717 or MD 90. Don't expect these to cut out all the noise. They do cut down the low end rumbles pretty well but just don't cut it on the high pitch end of the spectrum. Don't expect high quality sound from these if you like listening to higher quality audio.,73156,3507,3508,2,"It's been 4 months since I bought these headphones, and the sound in the right ear has recently started going in and out. I have to maneuver the wiring with tape on the left side in order to KEEP the sound in the right ear. My headphones always go out in one ear eventually, but never THIS quickly.October 2018 EDIT: I was sent another pair for free shortly after posting my initial review, but these too are acting up. If the wire gets moved (whenever I move my head in any direction), it can result in static, the sound coming out in only one ear, or silence. Going to have to purchase a different pair of headphones.",73157,3508,3509,0,"I purchased two of these on Aug 18. 2017. One failed in approximately 90 days and one in 110 days. Both outside the Amazon return window. Requested help (or at least sympathy..lol) from the shipper and received none. I do recognize that the shipper does not warrant the product; however, they normally have a better rapport with the manufacturer they represent. The units worked great until they both failed to pair with any of several devices they had been pairing with. This is the first negative review I can remember giving.",73158,3509,3510,0,"First off I'd like to clarify that I am by no means a audiophile, but have had my fair share of headphones in the past. Personally I don't think you should have to pay your months rent for a pair, but if they're too inexpensive it does raise some flags, that being said I do have a few that definitely breaks the mold that you have to pay more to get more. Which is what brought me to these, the mixture of pages of glowing reviews and even articles written by so called audiophiles, plus the price tag I would have been crazy not to jump on them right? I was beside myself with excitement when they arrived, I was going to be the proud owner of budget Beats! As far as looks go they are very aesthetically pleasing, they look nothing like you paid $34.99 that's great. The booklet stated that they needed to be charged for 4 hours before the first listen, it wasn't very long after I had them hooked up, maybe 2 hours if not that long the charging led shut off. It certainly wasn't the full 4 hours, I thought that was pretty odd but didn't put too much into it, the important thing was the sound.Another little cool feature is these headphones have voice commands never seen that on a pair before, now onto the sound. Putting it simple the sound is garbage, the bass if you can consider it as such is so muddy and muffled it almost sounds like the music is coming out of a hole, I had to turn my volume up to max and even then the sound was still horrendous. Now after all that I have to really wonder about all these beaming reviews, how many are authentic and how many are fabricated, that seems to be an ongoing issue on Amazon, I have learned if you want a truthful review on a product or an unbiased one that points out the bad as well as the good, look up 4 star and below ratings. If I had done so in the beginning I would have had more insight on the performance and been able to make a better thoughtfull purchase. The only pros to these are the look/design and voice command features, quite a few people were upset over the fact they don't seem to last long and have issues with connection, the fact that they seem not to come to a full4 hour charge could have meant trouble down the road as well. In this case you definitely get what you pay for.",73159,3510,3511,0,"This headphone set has poor sound quality: it lacks midrange, and attempts to compensate by boosting treble and bass, but in a bad way. Mids are still scooped & music sounds poor & cheap.The hissing white noise is intolerable, unless you like white noise then these are perfect for your youtube noise videos.I tested these with (remastered) Led Zeppelin, Physical Graffiti, and Hillsong United, Zion. I would've also tested with Maxim Vengerov or a Rachmaninov concerto but didn't bother after listening to two albums.I'm not an expert but I am a musician with sound engineer experience.",73160,3511,3512,0,"*UPDATE* March 2018: 1 starInitially, I really liked these headphones, but now after using them regularly over the past few months, my opinion has totally changed. (see original review below) For the first few months, they worked great, but now I regularly get these VERY loud interruptions to the audio I am listening to. Intermittently, the speakers will produce a VERY loud distortion sound that I can best describe as a combination of fuzzy static and a loud screech. It is always much much louder than whatever I am listening to which is completely jarring, and honestly quite frightening when listening to something quieter/gentler. (It is so unexpected and loud that it has made me physically jump). This is now happening more and more frequently, now occurring multiple times during a listening session (30min - 2hrs).This issue can't be caused by wear and tear because I have never even dropped my headphones or subjected them to any physical handing that would cause damage. They are either on my ears, or sitting on my desk.I also know that this issue can't be caused by a specific app or my phone, because it consistently occurs with multiple apps while using the headphones and has never occurred with any other bluetooth (or wired) device I have used with my phone.Overall, I am very disappointed with these, especially since I spent a lot of time shopping around and I thought I had finally found a reliable pair of bluetooth headphones.October 2017 Review: 5 starsWorks well. Great sounds. Easy and fast Bluetooth connection. Only complaint is that it's a bit tight on my ears and they get a little sore after awhile.",73161,3512,3513,0,"After seeing all the high reviews for these headphones, I purchased them with the expectation that they were going to be amazing, I came to the realization that those reviews were not accurate. IÂ’m of the belief that those high reviews were left after the initial use of the headphones.Construction quality - They feel flimsy at best. The earphones are comfortable but the unit tends to slide off of ones head and doesnÂ’t stay in place. After using them for a few months one of the earphones broke away from the unit and is only hanging by a wire. For the life of me I canÂ’t figure out how it happened or how it was even staying in place.Active Noise Cancelling - this worked great at first and after a while they had problems with periodically make a high pitched noise. The only remedy to this noise would be to turn off the active noise cancellation. When the active noise cancellation is in use another noise would emanate on the track is skipped or the music is stopped/started. In other words, donÂ’t touch the headphones when the active noise cancellation is in use.Battery life - Amazing! I could use them for over a week on a single charge.Sound Quality - The loudness is good, the lows are muffled and the bass in certain music makes it sound as if the drivers arenÂ’t able to reproduce the frequency accurately.",73162,3513,3514,2,"I've had these for 6 months and they were doing great until today when the left ear piece broke. I bought these for using at my desk, so I don't move them around. So, they shouldn't have broken because there is no wear and tear on them. When not in use, they sit on my desk. I was surprised today when I picked them up to find the headphones broken. They no long lay flat against my left ear. Before they broke, the sound quality was good but not 100% noise cancelling. They do block out a good amount of sound but if you want true noise cancelling headphones, these are not it. They are comfortable as I could wear them for basically 8 hours a day. But they are a bit bulky. Since they broke, I need to find a new pair. I don't know that I'll be purchasing these again.",73163,3515,3516,2,"EDIT: Updating my reviewI was apprehensive about these headphones because they're very heavy and I bought them for their noise-canceling abilities.I got them to use in a noisy open office. I am very gentle with them and they don't have to travel around in a backpack or anything, but I am wearing them for over 5 hours a day.They block out ambient sounds like air conditioners and mild background chatter, but they really don't block out voices of people near you, even if you're playing louder music.7 months after buying these things the headphones now make a tinny noise in the left ear. Its INCREDIBLY annoying, I feel like I have tinnitus when I'm wearing these things. The tinnny noise gets softer if I play audio, but it is still there.I'm glad they lasted over 6 months, but I still REALLY regret buying these things. They gave up after 7 months and are completely unusable.",73164,3516,3517,1,"I was a fresh college graduate looking for an affordable, reliable, and quality pair of Bluetooth headphones. One year later and I am still in love with these! The sound quality is fantastic, they look sleek and aesthetic, and Bluetooth syncing is never a problem. The product also comes with a good carrying bag, charger, and audio cable. Highly recommend a pair for all those trying to ball on a budget! You will not regret it!Update (1 year 2 months later): SO SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED with these...I was listening to some casual nighttime jazz while writing an email when I heard a cracking sound. Lo' and behold I found the ear module detached from the overhead component. Don't buy these if you are looking for a durable pair of headphones. As I look back at what I said in my initial review, I realize these aren't the most affordable headphones on the internet so I take that back. They break so they're clearly not reliable. Quality was great until AGAIN: they broke! Hard to appreciate sound quality when you can't put the headphones on your head. Sleek/Aesthetic? Yes, I'm bitter so yeah, I've seen better-looking headphones. I do NOT recommend a pair because you will neither be balling nor on a budget when you end up as flabbergasted as I am.Why would you not spend a little time making sure the overarching piece is securely holding the earpieces??

They're comfortable, somewhat sound-canceling. The sound is not crisp--it's fuzzy--but it isn't terrible. The problem was that the very first time I used them, the sound in each speaker cut in and out as I walked. Poor wiring somewhere. So I tried to return it. NO DICE. This item is not eligible for returns on Amazon. You have to contact Panasonic themselves via phone. I did so. Panasonic said they would only do exchanges, not returns, and I had to contact Amazon (and by the way, Amazon's customer service phone number is 1 (888) 280-4331 and they were lovely).

Out of warranty. They weren't expensive but I only want them for audio books, I'm functionally blind and unable to read print without complicated electronic aids.

Very uncomfortable to wear. I could not wear it for more than 10 minutes. The bass response was not very punchy and seemed very soft and distant.

Like most cheap audio products on Amazon made by Chinese manufacturers, you get what you pay for. However, with most that I've purchased the customer service has been great. If something breaks or stops working, I've never had an issue getting a replacement with no hassles. However, OneOdio is the exception. The soft foam part of the headset recently came off and there is no way to reattach it without it falling off again. I e-mailed the manufacturer asking for a replacement as there is a 24 Month Warranty on the product. They were slow to respond and instead of offering to replace the product, they asked me to try and fix it by sending me a video attached to an e-mail. First of all, I am not going to download a video attached to an e-mail. I've had enough issues with identify theft and viruses, besides it is not my responsibility to fix a defective product. Second, when I clicked on a link to their website with the video embedded, it's all in Chinese. And when I asked for a replacement again stating that it's not my responsibility to fix something that is clearly a problem with the product as there is no noticeable wear and tear to the device itself (I'm careful with my equipment), they ignored my e-mail.Anyway, buyer beware. You definitely get what you pay for. Given that there are a lot of competing devices of similar build quality (mostly made in China) pick one with better customer service and one who honors their warranty. The device itself is fine, it's about what you would expect for a 30 dollar set of headphones. Nothing fancy. Doesn't cancel noise or anything like that.

Second time they did not show up on the discover list. I reset everything and tried pairing a third time, they showed up on discover list and did not pair again. When the headphones arrived they did not look brand new, like I may have received a returned or defective item. They were packaged well, so no damage in shipment but the actual box for the headphones was not sealed and looked like it had been opened a few times.",73193,3548,3549,2,"I thought I had found a good pair of headphones for the price I paid. The sound was pretty good, and they felt comfortable to wear. They were only used with my PC at my desk. Four months after I started to use them the right ""arm"" of the headphones snapped, which left the earpiece just dangling from the rest of the headset. Taped it at the joint as best I could so that I could use them until a replacement was found, but of course they do not sit correctly on my head any more. Then the top lining of the headset started to detach, revealing the foam padding underneath. That was good money wasted on these and a lesson learned.",73194,3549,3550,1,"The sound quality is HORRIBLE, zero bass, in general, even when the volume is up to 10, it still sounds like a meow, instead of what a real music sounds like. Battery life: Charged all day, got 1 1/2 hours listening time. It's also not easy to connect to phone. Most importantly, the sound is HORRIBLE!!! Absolutely no bass or treble or anything in between! I bought another one in the same price range MPOW, the difference is night and day considering they're both about under $50. MPOW has super comfy cushion to the ears, and for the price, the depth and the high notes are good, and one charge on last you almost 5 hours of listening to music.",73195,3550,3551,1,"I initially wrote a decent review for these headphones as the product was a good value for the price. However, in the six months since the company has begun cyber stalking me. Initially it was a friendly email saying, ""hey, we've had some issues with these headphones and would like to send a replacement pair."" I responded back thanks, but mine are working fine so there's no need. This began a now 3-month reign of terror with 1-5 emails every week saying the same thing, sometimes personalized from someone named Monica, other times generic. They literally won't quit. I have blocked them and they found a new way to get in. I have reported them to Amazon and they still don't stop. My inbox it littered with their emails.

This is my 3rd one, and I am tired and will not BUY another Bose until the wire quality is not improved. I am sorry but when someone buy a earphone for $120+ that person can expect that the thing will be a part of his everyday life and it will last long. I don't expect it to last a lifetime though.

I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile. I am a Bose fan and have been for several years. I have had several home theater systems, sound wave systems, portable speaker systems, etc. going back several years. I first tried their earbuds a number of years ago and was (to my surprise) disappointed in the sound quality, something I never thought I'd say about a Bose product. The earbuds did not form a good ""seal"" in my ear and let too much ambient noise in causing a less-than-stellar audio experience. I tried them again two more times in recent years and experienced the same thing. I had all but given up on Bose earbuds but decided to give these a shot because I desperately want to like them and hoped that Bose had upped their game. My verdict...""meh."" While better than past versions I still am left disappointed in the lack of bass from a $100 set of earbuds. Not ear-popping, thumping bass, but rich fulfilling lows. I'll probably keep these only because I'm tired of sending them back. I must say that after trying several brands of earbuds nothing compares to Monster's audio sound. Clear highs, rich lows. Too bad their durability is lacking. I will say that I've had a pair of the Monster Achieve wireless earbuds for the past 6 months and, honestly, they are some of the best earbuds I've ever owned...And for nearly 1/2 the price of these wired buds they are a bargain. I also just purchased a pair of Monster Clarity buds at the airport for a recent flight and again, impressed by the audio quality. I use these in the gym without any problems. However, when running outdoors I cannot find a decent pair of wireless buds that hold their bluetooth connection for the duration. Suggestions welcome.UPDATE July 19: It is has been shy of 1 month having used these earbuds, roughly a total of 15 - 5mi outdoor runs in the TX heat. They are done. First sign was when they decided to turn on by themselves randomly at max volume while sitting on the counter while still connected to the iPod (this happened in the middle of the night twice.)... Then the volume would randomly increase to max high then max low while mid-run. Then the static started in the left bud and gradually worsened. The remote is completely responsive now.. I tested on 2 different iPods. Luckily it's within 2 days of return status...Hopefully I can return these without issue.",73199,3555,3556,0,"While it is possible this item was defective, out of the box it did not work with my IPhone X or my friendÂ’s IPhone 6 despite the box explicitly saying that the product was designed to work with IPhones, IPads, and IPods.Using an connection adaptor I plugged this into my IPhone X and after playing for about 1-2 minutes an error box appeared on my IPhone stating it was not compatible with my device. I tried five other connection adaptors and still received the same results an error so it was not the adaptors. Then tried it on my friendÂ’s IPhone 6 with the same results.Tried to make a call with it but it did not work. So no idea about that function.When it did briefly work the sound was slightly above average compared to other brands of in-the-ear earphones I have owned. They are no where near the quality of over the ear headphones. Overall rhey seemed tuned for the middle sound spectrum. The bass as fine but not deep. And the treble and higher pitches were average. The mid-ranges were the clearest and the best. Tried them on rock, rap, classical, and techno music and they were the least impressive with classical and did not provide good bass for the techno.As noted by other reviewers, they do not form a suction to the ear so the Â“noise cancelingÂ” function is not effective or noticeable. Comfort is subjective due to eachnpersonÂ’s ear. For me they we quite comfortable for about 20 minutes and then they created a slight pressure. They seemed to hold well in the ear and presumably would have been fine for exercise had they worked.Overall and assuming they work properly they are a slightly above average set of earphones that seems like they could have been decent earphones for exercise provided your music is not in a IPhone.",73200,3556,3557,2,"I bought these to replace an older pair of Bose that I got 5 years ago. The only reason they needed to be replaced is because my dog ate them. That being said, they were amazing. They weren't even the sport edition for working out, but I used them at the gym 5 times a week, getting them sweaty and dirty, but NEVER had an issue. Fast forward to this new pair.....I purchased these 3 months ago and I am already having connection issues. The sounds cuts out constantly and the button functions won't work unless I disconnect the headphones and reconnect. Physically, the headphones are in great shape, you would never know by looking at them that they have almost lost all function. Being that these are the sport headphones, I think they should be able to withstand a little jostling around in my pocket at the gym. The older Bose had a 90 degree angle jack for the headphones, so that could be the issue. I'm not sure, but it's a shame because the sounds quality of Bose products in my opinion is second to none although that all goes out the window if the sound is cutting out the entire time you are using the headphones. My suggestion would be to try bluetooth or try and find the older model of Bose earbuds. Hopefully that helps, I just wish quality would move forward with technology.",73201,3557,3558,0,"This is a small-ish headset, which definitely is NOT over-ear one, but more like ""on the ears"" model, unless you have super tiny ears, or you buy this for your kids.After around an hour of use, I had to stop using them because they gave me so much pain & bruises on both ears and on top of my head as well (see photos). Bluetooth connectivity seemed a bit ""jerky"", and thus the sound wasn't all nice and smooth all the time, but sounded like it was on the edge of dropping, but without really totally dropping though, if you see what I mean.Gave 2 stars since the sound quality was alright, and it comes with a nice storage/transportation pouch and accessories. But that's about all.",73202,3558,3559,1,"You should not be surprised by the price. You definitely get what you pay for. Do not buy these if you think you're buying a cheap pair of headphones with low end. I can't say the sound is bad, but it's almost like you're listening through a tin can. There's not really much bass and it sounds somewhat like you're turning cheap speakers up and putting them next to your ears.For the price, they're fine. I'm going to keep them because we always need an extra set of headphones laying around. but they are just that - cheap, low quality sound.",73203,3559,3560,0,"These headphones have a surprising number of features, but the audio quality is not what I would consider acceptable. The real issue is that the sound is missing mid to high end clarity, which is why my rating was 2 stars. I purchased these mainly for the bluetooth functionality, and they connected to my computer with no issue. It was also impressive being able to tune in FM radio stations with just a few clicks, and the reception was adequate, but not without some static. There is also an SD card slot that I've not tested yet. I appreciate the ambition in the feature set, but I would prefer a better sounding set of bluetooth headphones regardless of any additional features like an SD Card slot and FM radio.",73204,3560,3561,2,"I knew it was too go to be true. Less than 20 hours of use between a couple of tablets and four flights and one side is not working when plugged in. These are being worn by kids 7 and 9 and they thought they were comfortable but alas, so sad when one year stops working. The bluetooth seemed to work pretty easy but having two pair of these in the house caused MASS confusion since they would pair to the wrong tablet. Didn't see that coming. Oh well. Back to plugs and another brand!",73205,3561,3562,2,"Bought these for my upcoming trips which include long international flights.THE LOOK: The headphones look very nice and comes with a carrying case, usb charger, and aux cord for direct plug in. I suggest being very careful opening and closing them because it's plastic so it might snap without proper care. For reference, I got the teal with white and it's a dark teal color which I really like. Looks cool with the white designed lining.THE SET UP: I unwrapped and plugged it into charge using my laptop. It took about 3 hours to fully charge which is indicated by the red light turning off. Once you turn on the headphones it prompts you that it's ready to pair. Pairing with my mac air was easy. I just turned on the bluetooth feature and opened up the preferences and found ""power locus.""THE FIT/FEEL: I've been wearing it for about an hour now and it almost fits around my ears comfortably. The top of my head feels a bit sore though but it's probably because I'm not used to wearing heavy over the head headphones (personal thing and may not be an issue for others). There is also that same padding on the top of the headband that is around the ears so it helps.SOUND QUALITY: My friend sitting near me (approx 6 feet away) is able to hear my music, especially with heavy bass so if you're in close proximity to others they might be able to hear what you're listening to as well. Sound Quality is decent but I'm having issues with the sound...there's been a consistent stop and go like it's not fully connected. It's been pretty annoying when my music sounds like it's constantly skipping. I tried different songs to see if maybe it was my music but it's not. It shouldn't be a pairing issue since I'm sitting directly in front of my computer with no other electronics to disrupt the signal strength. To test, I also walked to the other room, approx 20-25 feet away before it completely stopped working, then walked back and music resumed.OVERALL: For the price, I would say without the stop and go, it's pretty decent and beautiful. Not sure if that issue will resolve itself but I feel like I might have a defective product. Was really hoping it would've worked out for me considering my nearing trips but, unfortunately, I leave for within the next week so I don't have time to return, process that and wait for another one.",73206,3562,3563,1,"Great price, and initially good, pretty darn good sound, amazing actually, but the charges did NOT hold 30 hrs at all, maybe 12 to 15.And then after a month or so the charging port broke, VERY VERY CHEAP MATERIALS...

I tried to power off/on, rebooted my phone, and even tried to pair with another device but nothing worked. My opinion, these are too flaky, I will spend more money on something I can count on.Besides the above, here are my observations:PROS:sounds was good, and very loud. I used them for a couple of hours and they were comfortable to wear for that period.CONS:Always defaults to LOUD when powering on.No way to adjust volume on the headset when listening via Bluetooth. you can only control volume from the source. if you try hitting volume controls, it just skips to next track (or previous track when clicking ""down"").Ear cups a little small. I don't think I could wear them for more than 2 hrs at a time.USB charging port feels flimsy.Bottom line: Not worth the 15 bucks I paid.",73210,3566,3567,2,"I used them all of two or three times before they started having issues. Connecting irregularly or not at all even though they were never more than one foot away from my laptop, repeatedly & independently powering off after only a minute of use, frequent skipping on the rare occasion I actually got any audio with them, they never worked with the included aux cord, FM mode never worked, etc. On top of the mechanical issues, they're uncomfortable to wear, uncomfortably heavy, and not flexible at all; it felt like wearing a narrow, weighted bicycle helmet.

They were excellent for the price, and they lasted 6 months with very heavy use. Their design was great, light and fit on the ears perfectly. Sound was definitely beyond this price range. When the left side stopped working, I decided to purchase JVC again since they met the need. My purchase of the black JVC Flats went smoothly. When I opened the blister packaging, both of the ear pieces came apart. The plastic piece that attached the earphones to the headband had sheared. Amazon quickly took them back and replaced them. The replacement came (black again) and this time one of the ear pieces was detached from the headband. The plastic piece was sheared again. This is apparently a design flaw since it was repeated. I would have given these 5 stars for the price and sound, but having two new sets arrive already broken deserves a low ranking.

The following week they Broke in a third place and it would have meant trying super glue or gum and a paper clip or some kind of magic spell to repair...but I'm no Macgyver. For the price, the sound is nice enough, but what good is decent sound when you need three hands to hold them to your ears?Pros - They're price point is cheap. The sound is decent.Cons - They're SO cheaply made they fall apart quickly.Waste of money.Totally environmentally unfriendly, as they'll be in a landfill any day now.",73213,3569,3570,1,Headphones are smaller than they look in the picture. Sound is good but I wouldn't call it a noise canceling product. The only problem I have with these headphones is that they slip out of my head when I'm working out. If I lower my head they fall off of my head right away. And they get very sweaty quickly so my ears feel wet during my workouts. Other than that sound is good.8/12: second review a little over a month later. The pad that covers the actual earphone fell off and it is impossible to put it back. I can't use these anymore. Would not recommend this product anymore.,73214,3570,3571,1,"Am revising my review after a replacement pair bought in Dec. 2017 started failing in three months.

Old review below.Had gotten the wife a pair of these years ago. Won't please audiophiles but they are very comfortable which is what she is concerned with while watching her cat videos. The heavy insulation near the plug came apart, prompting the replacement. The old ones still work, but don't have any electrical tape. Will save it as a spare.",73215,3571,3572,0,"Purchased these to replace the set of blue ones I'd bought that are almost identical but worn down after years of regular use. I like the blue ones a lot, which is why I bought another pair. They're compact and have great sound for headphones so small, plus they're very affordable. But these purple headphones had a spot on one of the ear pads right away when I opened it (first photo), and it started tearing apart within two days of light use (second photo). Sometime around the third day, I had black flakes coming off onto my face and in my hair when I would wear them. So, I just stopped using them and went back to the blue pair. It's otherwise a great product, but I wish the company did better quality control on the fabric.",73216,3572,3573,2,"Sound wise, awesome headphones. Quality is great. Noise cancellation is really more noise mitigation. It clears the lower frequencies, but you can still hear higher pitched sound and louder sounds when its active. The auto detect off ear function is surprisingly useful.After about 6 months using these daily, the battery stopped taking a charge. The included cables do not charge the battery. I also tried changing the cables to see if that was it, but I'm left to conclude that the fault is with the headphones.Incidentally, a co-worker of mine has the exact same model of headphones. He's had his for longer than mine, around a year or more I think, and his also stopped charging. There is probably an issue with the headphones themselves.Conclusion: For the price, I would look for a more reliable brand. 2 out of 2 headphones fail to charge after about a year.

The constanly cut in and out everytime i move my head (due to the function that allows them to turn off by turning the cups sideways). The sound was descent but not near as good as the Boss i ended up purchasing after these. I really don't know who these are designed for. I have small- normal sized ears if anything and they don't stick out. Do not think these are in the same league as the Bose because they are simply not. This was the second mistake i made looking for in-flight headphones. Just buy the boss if that's what you are looking for. If you are like me, you will end up buying them anyway.",73218,3574,3575,1,"Pros:Great sound. Nice bass.Excellent rechargeable battery life--days and days.Great for phone conversations or music. People I speak with on the phone tell me I sound great.Handy buttons for phone functions and a spring-loaded dial for volume.Much more affordable than similar Bose headphones.Cons:Bulky and heavy. MUCH heavier than Bose.Noise cancelling is pretty good, but not as good as Bose.Shallow earcups (too shallow) that put pressure on your ears and cause some discomfort for extended wear.Earcups have pivoting attachments at the top to attach to the head piece, and they don't pivot enough, so that the top of the ear cups do not rest on your head like they should, which causes more comfort issues.EVERY SINGLE TIME you turn it on, you have to listen to a stupid, cheesy sound effect and a voice that tells you about the battery level and all bluetooth connections. And I swear it waits until you put it on to make all this unwanted noise--you can't turn it on, give it a few seconds and then put it on to avoid it. It really needs a STFU setting or button.EDIT: April 2018My headphones are now almost a year old, and they no longer work very well. Quite often now when I put them on and turn them on, they will cycle thru their power on nonsense (stupid sound effect and announcing charge level and Bluetooth connections) and then seemingly power off or disconnect from everything, and then start over again in an endless loop. It takes several or many attempts of power cycling to get it to stay on. The battery is fully charged. These headphones have been babied through their short life; almost no travel and only used a few times a week in an office environment. There is no reason for them to be so unreliable at less than a year old.Spend the extra money and get the Bose headphones. These will not last and they're just not as comfortable or good as Bose.",73219,3576,3577,2,"I don't normally like to give a product a 1 star review, but these things just made me angry in so many ways. I'm not sure if I got a lemon or what, as the ANC feature actually introduces noise into the left ear when you turn it on, but I'm not going to risk another ruined afternoon. These go back post haste!An important note about voice prompts and audio feedback.They're often quite cool on a smart speaker sitting across the room. Ludicrous to have piping directly into both ears at point blank range with no ability to disable, attenuate, or bypass.***Imagine if every time you changed channels on your TV it shined a very bright light in your eyes for a few seconds... it's exactly that pleasant - but for the ears.PROS: --- the threshold criteria-Build quality is quite nice. The band and hinges are smooth, and look legit. The rew/play/skip buttons are pretty easy to use. Pairing is fast and simple. Quite comfortable. I did not wear them for very long, but knew I had a good fit as soon as I put them on my head. Price is good for the specifications - if only they delivered on them*. I actually like the style of them, even though they're not popular with many.CONS*: --- Everything you actually bought it to do.-Voice prompts, done in a really low sample rate scratchy sound, accompany almost every single button you can press on this thing. And it itÂ’s not talking at you, it will be beeping at you. You canÂ’t disable them, you canÂ’t turn them down, and you canÂ’t bypass them. There is no escaping the, Â“Gee whiz we thought voice prompts were coolÂ” bender this headphone designer was on. Too bad they knew so little about designing a pair of music headphones.-The sound is bass heavy, and muddy. Tried it with several different songs, with and without the cord. Of course itÂ’s better with, but then why buy wireless? Controls for the volume are a real pain to operate. It's a recessed ring with very light grip-texture that is almost slippery, and you must twist it using two finger tips to actuate it. Be prepared to frequently skip tracks by accident.-Open mic mode is a great feature on the Sony MWX-1000. Magical really, as it will instantly let you bypass the sound playback and noise cancelling for a quick ""what are they saying on the airport intercom?"" moment, but thanks to the stupid voice prompt on the Plantronics you're losing at least 4 seconds of sound, and with it any chance of hearing what they just said over the intercom. Add to that, the audio quality of the open mic is really poorly processed. Once it is working, it sounds like everything is happening about 8 feet away from you, strangely processed, and echo-laden.-And as for the ANC, quite underwhelming. I know how ANC is supposed to work. Normally good for cancelling droning smooth predictable background noise, not so great at the intermittent noises like barking, people talking, anything arrhythmic is a challenge for the circuitry. So very sad to say that they barely even muffled the sound of the fan in my normal desktop computer.-And, to top it all off, the silly things start producing noise in the left ear as soon as you turn on the Active Noise Cancellation!!! Why on earth would I want a device with ANC that actually adds audible noise to my listening experience?!?! If I turn up the music I can drown out the static, but at that point how do I know if theyÂ’re cancelling the noise or just being noisy.I like Plantronics office devices, and it seems like this is where this one came from engineering wise, but I don't even want it in my office. Someone else can have it.",73220,3577,3578,0,"Volume and sound quality lacks completely. I use for my commute to work and you can hear the train chugging along and also hear the doors closing and next stop announcements over the loudest volume setting.

They just do not have any cling to the ear and that kills sound quality and noise canceling.

I started to assume it was the shoes seeing as there is ZERO support from these shoes. I ended up returning them, and continued to work out wearing different shoes. The damage was done, and things got much much worse. I'm a nurse, so I tried to just ice, take ibuprofen, and rest. That wasn't doing the trick so I went to my nearest urgent care. After 7 x-ray images, I found out I had severe tendinitis and swelling in my L ankle, and both of my knees. Thankfully it wasn't a hairline fracture, which I was thinking it may have been considering how excruciating the pain was. No gym for 2 weeks, ankle wrap, naproxen, rest, and icing was my treatment.

Both shoes have brown stains that are sticky on the inside of the shoe like glue near the toe. The stitching for the foot pad in the shoe looks good around the heel and as you go towards the tow, the stitches become wide in length and spacing. They don't look right, more like knock-offs after talking to several parents with children who have the Nfinity Vengeance shoe. There is also something sticky (like a price sticker glue) over the Nfinity name on the tongue of one shoe. These shoes look terrible, and for $90, insane. Hopefully Amazon will make the replacement process easy and I will update this review when the new shoes arrive.",73267,3628,3629,0,"this product is light weight...my daughter loves these shoes...she is a power tumbler ...i am very disappointed in them....i bought these shoes in April right before Worlds...she only broke them in and only used them for Worlds..by June she already had holes in the sole..no she did not wear them outside she only wore them in the gym or on the competition floor..I am extremely disappointed in this product because I was told from Nfinity representative that they will last a season...but they didn't...and after contacting Nfinity I was basically told ""too bad""...but my daughter loves them and yes i will have to buy another pair...I am hoping this pair will last longer than a couple of months.",73268,3629,3630,2,"My freshman varsity cheerleader is not a fan of these shoes at all. First, the gray lines through them actually make them look dirty before they are even worn. It only gets worse after a few wears. The length runs small, and the width is wider than most cheer shoes. My daughter has wider feet, and still has to cinch up the laces to the point that they look ridiculous when on just to keep her shoes on.We bought a pair of Chasse for $13 last year, and my daughter would prefer to wear those over the Nfinity pair. There is no real support in these shoes at all, which isn't good for the bases as all. If our cheer squad did not make these shoes mandatory, we would not purchase them again.",73269,3630,3631,1,"My daughter loved these shoes when she first got them because they are light weight. She only wears the shoes indoors for competitive cheerleading. The shoes are literally falling apart. Two cheerleaders from her squad had the same problem with their shoes. They were able to return them to the sports store that they purchased them from for new shoes. Unfortunately, I can not return the shoes that I bought on Amazon. Do not buy these shoes. I am not happy that I paid $90 for a pair of cheer shoes that will not last one-fourth of the cheer season.",73270,3631,3632,0,We have purchased annually for the last 4 cheer seasons however this years pair were defective. After one indoor practice the sole started coming apart and the toes started to become unglued. I came back to Amazon to double check the order because I felt that perhaps these were fake. I now see that they were actually sold by Amazon so I assuming we got a defective pair. I see others have recently had the same issue so im worried that something overall has changed with the shoe. I am simply not paying $100 for a cheer shoe that starts to fall apart after a single 2 hour practice though.,73271,3632,3633,0,"The quality of the show is insanely cheap the material isnÂ’t good not only that but you can take the cushion off. for some reason rather easily and underneath is all raw Â“Pipe workÂ” if you can call it that. Only reason IÂ’m giving it 3 Stars is because itÂ’s a shoe and it does whatÂ’s itÂ’s designed to do. Put it on your feet and walk with them. Works there wouldnÂ’t be surprised if they start falling apart after a month. There are better shoes out their for this price, but IÂ’m just to lazy to return them.",73272,3634,3635,0,"They're smaller than expected. They are about as expected length/width-wise but the roof of the shoe (I don't know what it's called.. where the laces are) is much lower than is typical of shoes this size so the span of the laces is considerably wider while worn.They are also more white, less grey than the image shows.I still generally like ... or.. don't dislike them.

The shoes came late for christmas, when opening the plastic bag they came in i thought this must be the wrong order... nope. They are made of the cheapest rubber crap you get when you buy littlw kid water shoes. They have no padding or sole inside. My husband tried them on and the glue is already pulling apart on the sides. The color is awful mostly because they are supposed to be grey ... they are white. But turn a grey when uou wear black socks under them from the material being so thin on top .. made so cheap im embarrassed for the people selling them. I would never buy these shoes for $5.. much less $25! Ill be returning these.",73274,3636,3637,2,"I gave a three star review because while I got to wear the shoe I extremely enjoyed how it fit and was very comfortable, not to mention it looked great but unfortunately after wearing the shoe only two times it broke. The small clasps that hold the lace broke casing them to be unable to be tied. I would recommend the shoe if you don't tie your shoes extremely tight like i do, but if you do tie your shoes very tight then I would probably steer clear.",73275,3637,3638,0,"I wanted to like these so badly! I wear a 9.5-10 so I ordered the 10 and they were quite loose and had about a 1/2 an inch of space in the toe. They're very lightweight, which is nice, but the ankle cuts up so high, and is so itchy, I couldn't wear them for more than a couple minutes! They're cute, but I just think it's unfortunate that the design cuts so high and is so uncomfortable. Wish they would have worked, but they just didn't work for me.",73276,3638,3639,0,"These just arrived today. The color leans more towards a violet than a purple, and it has silver threads woven into the fabric, they are a super cute, inexpensive pair of sneakers, nothing to rave about. The downside; they have the bare minimum of cushion inside. I attached pictures so you can see what IÂ’m describing. It appears to have arch support but if you notice, the stitching only curves which gives the illusion of arch support (middle pic). These shoes are completely flat inside. I paid $22.99 obviously, I donÂ’t plan to, or expected to be able to go runnning or do an entire day of walking in them. I think they will look really cute with my jeans and LSU tee-shirt on weekends. I will update later on their durability.",73277,3639,3640,0,"These shoes ran large on me, and I'm always a true size 8. That's the main reason I returned them. They weren't necessarily too long, but definitely on the wide side. The pink fabric has flecks of gold throughout which I didn't expect. I wasn't sure how I liked it, but after a while I thought it was fine for ""fashion"" athlesiure shoes. I wanted these just to run around in, not for workouts.You definitely won't be able to use these shoes for heavy workouts like running, but they'd be fine for walking and just kicking around. The soles didn't seem like rubber, but more like styrofoam. Kind of strange, but very lightweight, though! I also thought the bottoms were really slick -- walking on a tile floor in my house was a little slippery -- not a good grip on the bottoms.Bottom line - if you're looking for inexpensive athleisure shoes these would be fine, but they ran larger on me.",73278,3640,3641,1,"Like many before me, I ignored the reviews about the golden glitter because I'm a darn fool. Friends, it looks like a pink and gold striped glittery shoe. I spent an hour trying to get a picture of them to prove how but it doesn't show up on camera. The pink looks much more subtle in pictures too but nope, you are walking around with bright, glittery shoes.I also don't like tennis shoes that make my feet look big (ya know what i'm saying) and these will do that to you hardcore.I returned them and found some cheaper and nicer ones elsewhere, thats my recommendation to you.",73279,3641,3642,2,"I really wanted to love these. They are super cute, I bought the grey with gold. Unfortunately the material of the sole is a foam type of material, which is quite slippery on any smooth surface. I sprayed some hairspray on the bottoms, to add a bit of tackiness. Not sure how well that will work if they get wet (hopefully won't make them even more slick LOL), but it is helping for now. Also, the top, back of the sneaker sort of digs into the back of my ankle, so I wouldn't wear these for long walks. The sizing is accurate, I normally wear a women's US 11, ordered the 11, and they fit perfect. I will keep them since they were inexpensive, and wear them to work since I sit most of the day. Won't be purchasing again.",73280,3642,3643,0,"I ordered these shoes for a trip and wore them a couple of time around the house prior to my trip. I wore them for about 6 hours on the trip and the widths is just not wide enough for my feet. I love the shoes, but cannot wear them and the return date has expired. Also from what I can tell these shoes do not come in wide widths. Pleas let me know what options are available to me for a return. Thank you.",73281,3643,3644,1,"I was excited for these shoes until I opened the box, I got so angry!!! If you look at the photos you can obviously see that one shoe looks older than the other Â— from the shoe color to shoelace and even the sole , they are all a different shades! The material is even scratched up. AND the Â“Rose DustÂ” color does not even match whatÂ’s in the picture. Returning.",73282,3644,3645,0,"These just werenÂ’t for me. They look like great shoes and with all shoes it depends On Your feet. I do not have a technically wide foot but it is not narrow either. The widest part of my foot was getting pinched so I returned them. They didnÂ’t seem to be narrow shoes but something about the way they are made just pinched my foot. They also seemed a little big length wise but that may be the sizing. I wear an 8 and these are said to be 8-8.5 American size but I would call them an 8.5. Of course socks could make a difference. I tried them with running socks, but if you are a typical 8 and plan to wear thick socks they might not slip. I would definitely suggest if you are interested but not sure about these that you use prime wardrobe so if they donÂ’t work you can return for free.",73283,3645,3646,1,For the amount of money I paid for these shoes they were not as described nor was the quality! If I could give BEN a zero star I would ! I had to send them back to get a bigger size and they still felt tight. I wore them to break them in and they squeaked so much! I tried all the tricks to stop it and it just wouldnÂ’t let up! So embarrassing walking around the hospital making so much noise. When I got home to look at the shoes they already had water stains on them! Only after 12 hours of being worn! A complete waste of my money and totally not worth the buy in my eyes. IÂ’m upset that I spent 160+ on something that didnÂ’t even do half the job it was described to. Poor quality and poor choice on my part.,73284,3646,3647,0,"OMG ya'll, where to even begin. I don't know if I just got a defective shoe or if this is typical of ECCO, but the quality is severely lacking. I'd be upset if a shoe half this price had all these issues. I'm just going to make a list for ease of reading.CONS1) Small holes in the rubber sole. Lots of them. Never have I seen such a thing. I'm going to guess when the sole was molded tiny air bubbles were present, creating this swiss cheese disaster.2) Very obvious seams on the front and back of the rubber sole. I was so baffled by this I thought I was the crazy one, and maybe all my sneakers have seams and I just never noticed. So I checked and no. This is just shoddy craftsmanship.3) The edges of the leather weren't smooth and looked worn.4) Scuff marks. Only one is visible in the pictures (on the heel) but there were a few more that just didn't show up well when photographed.5) The white leather has a greyish look to it, and the laces are beige, not white. They are also weirdly stiff.6) On the inside of the shoe, you can see the green underside of the insole. To be honest, I probably wouldn't have cared about that if it wasn't on top of all these other bizarre issues.Basically, this shoe was just one giant cluster----. But on a positive note, the leather was very soft and it was actually pretty comfortable. Ha.",73285,3647,3648,2,"The first problem is the sizing of these shoes. I wear a mens size 9.5 M, I ordered a mens 10 M expecting to get a little extra room. What I got instead was a shoe that was more in line with a size 7 narrow. I could not even fit my toes in the opening. The shoe is clearly stamped 10M, definitely a mis-sizing. The other problem had to do with the quality of the shoe's upper part. The canvas used is very thin and flimsy feeling. Also the seams were all ragged and unfinished on the inside. I returned them immediately and will not be considering Vans in the future. A total disappointment.",73286,3648,3649,0,"The color was not as expected and it seems like Vans changed their product because I've been wearing this model for some years now, bought a few pairs of it throughout the years always the same size, and now the shoe is much harder to put on so it feels smaller, but then after it's on, the foot moves around in the shoe. A smaller size just won't go on because the opening is too narrow.Returned the shoe and went to the store to try on a few more pairs and had the same problem. The salesperson said they're getting a lot of similar complaints lately.I loved my Vans and i hope they fix up the model.",73287,3649,3650,0,"order a half size up though, my heels will slip out of the back. So, while the length of the shoe is true, the space between the insole and upper only allows for a pancake thin foot! If these are the only shoes someone wears, it's probably because their grossly misshapen feet won't fit into normal shoes!That being said, I did receive my shipment quickly. The sizing on this page was very misleading, but I looked at shoezoo's website to make sure the size I ordered would be the size I received (they were the vendor that came up when I chose my size from the drop down). I only wish they offered free returns.",73288,3650,3651,1,"Huge Disappointment! My daughter has been patiently waiting for school time to get these, she is a HUGE Zelda fan. She wears a size 4 so we ordered a 4 and they were way too small. So we returned them and got a 4.5 and even though those were 4 inches longer than her actual foot, they STILL would not fit! These shoes are SO narrow. I'VE NEVER had such a problem with Vans being that narrow...maybe because these were leather, but regardless ahe is devastated thatbthey did not fit. And now I can't find the canvas ones in her aize at all. Why are these soo narrow?? Why cant Vans make a wide version of each size like every other shoe company. Either way, these were more narrow than any shoe I've ever seen. She doesn't even wear a ""wide"" normally...shes 10 years old. Well now she is a very sad 10 year old!! Thanks Vans!",73289,3651,3652,2,"I have no idea what people see in these shoes. They seem alright at first, but they're basically just covered flip-flops, and you can walk about as far in them, which is to say barely at all. But at least flip-flops are good for the beach; these are just a flimsy and uncomfortable pair of shoes. Don't do it. Don't make your feet uncomfortable and give yourself blisters just because they look good. Get a real pair of sneakers that you can wear and do whatever you want in without ever having to worry about your feet. I regret this purchase and regret that in order to come to this conclusion I've already worn them outside too much to return them.

Okay, fine. Then a little while after I order I realize these are coming direst from China. Okay... sure. Maybe they were backordered or something. Whatever, no big deal, I'll wait. A month later, what is pictured shows up and YEAH not even close to being the same quality let alone the same shoe! The actual marketing pictures of the Clay Nubuck shoe are what I received the first time. This 2nd order is NOT EVEN CLOSE. Color is different, grey not clay/beige in the slightest. The material is so, so thin on the top, it should be embarrassing. They're way too small and very narrow. The piping around the edge is not even the same color as the rest of the shoe. And there is this thin sheeting on the inside that without even trying the shoe on, was peeling and not secured. Utterly inexcusable quality. I highly recommend finding a different shoe vendor to purchase from. And shame on Amazon for letting this stuff slide.",73291,3653,3654,2,"I bought a pair of these a couple weeks ago.

The 7.5 is perfect now. I chose the neutral gray color which will work beautifully with many of my casual outfits.These shoes are cute but now that IÂ’ve worn them a bit IÂ’m incredibly disappointed.

If everything were this upsetting, I would not have ordered so many items. However I donÂ’t blame Amazon. ItÂ’s Reebok I am upset with. I have worn ONLY Princess and Classic Leather for longer than I can remember. They have been the only shoe styles that have been comfortable for my aching feet. I have always worn 7 1/2 and 7 1/2 wide D. Since they were leather, they fit wonderfully. The cut has been perfect and they have been very comfortable from the time I first put them on. Any snug areas, as around my bunions, stretched to fit quickly.

Never would have thought they are not the ReebokÂ’s I have grown to be so attached to. They are not leather, but man-made non- flexible material cut to a size unknown to me. They are now at a shoe repair shop being stretched for a week with a hopeful change in toe box width so they are wearable. For $8 a pair, they Â“ mightÂ” be acceptable.. Since they were so painful on first try, they have to be better. I am near tears and and am afraid I will need to make another round at the shoe stores to hunt for a different brand and style.

The heel of the shoe is very wide, but the toe box (which is the important part of the shoe for me) is narrow, about the same as a 6B. The ""leather"" which is some synthetic form does not give or stretch - like trying to do anything athletic in a street shoe.I have used these shoes to play tennis for many years. Yes, I know they aren't heavy duty tennis shoes, but comfort was more important and I simply absorbed the cost of about 5 pairs a year. I always bought all the size 6 (and more recently 6W) the store had in stock, often walking out with 6 pairs. Back then the quality wasn't always consistent, but I was able to avoid poorly made Princess shoes by being careful about the country in which they were made. For the last couple of years, all of the Princess shoes seem to have been made in Viet Nam. And, every pair is the same poor quality.

A $1.00 bottle of super glue from Walmart seemed to take care of this problem and the rubber outside stuck better than whatever garbage adhesive was originally used.

Again I was wrong. Even though I had completely re-attached the white rubber to each shoe, water still found its way in no matter what I did. Many wet socks later I decided to give up on Converse. If I wanted my feet to get wet, I wouldÂ’ve bought sandals.Converse used to be solid shoes, but ever since they got bought out the quality noticeably declined in order to save a few pennies and delivering an inferior product.

I pulled my old fila's out to compare and the quality isn't there. They just feel cheap. Too bad. They were a great shoe. I am returning these and have gone back to k-swiss. Bring back the quality. I will pay for it.",73306,3669,3670,1,Be very careful when buying these shoes an dont use their size recommender.i used that an i got a size 10.5 shoe that is ridiculously huge on my foot so i cant wear it nobody wants to buy it an it cost the price of a shoe to send it back.so i would say be careful when buying these shoes because they are naturally very big an if u get the wrong size your in trouble.,73307,3670,3671,1,"Very disappointed that the ad information is false / incorrect. I have emailed Amazon and the seller. If you see the ad and it still says they are leather at all, then the ad is still incorrect. The shoe label clearly shows these are 100% synthetic materials with a textile (synthetic) base. No leather anywhere on this shoe at all. I bought a pair of these about 10 years ago and they lasted a long time and actually had some leather in them. No more leather now. Not as good a shoe anymore. Just cheap fake PU. Not worth the price they are asking for this cheap fabric shoe. To bad everything is getting SO cheap and tacky.",73308,3671,3672,0,"I bought a pair of the white Fila a couple weeks ago after reading the reviews about ordering a half size up I went ahead and got an 11 typically wear a 10.5 good thing I did because the 11 fit perfectly I loved the comfort so much that I decided to get another couple pairs another white and a black pair, the size 11 white pair fit the exact same as the ones I bought prior.. but trying on the black pair I found them extremely tight in the toe box and rubbing my little toe on the side as well as my toes going all the way up in the shoe pushing inside the end. From the outside they look exactly the same size but upon pulling the innersoles and measuring them I found the black pair a full size smaller then the white or about a quarter of an inch, i've provided pictures showing the difference in the size of the insoles on top of each other as you can see it's quite a difference so if you get the black pair I might suggest you go a full size larger I will be returning these for a size 11.5.. I really love this shoe overall they are super comfortable providing you get the correct size.",73309,3672,3673,2,"The description clearly states that these are leather. This is completely false. They are man-made materials. The upper does not have ANY natural leather on it. 100% fake, man-made materials (or ""pleather"" [for ""plastic leather] as I call it).I went ahead and slipped one on just to see whether the sizing was even correct and it was WAY off. I normally wear a size US 11. I read reviews saying to order a half-size up in these, so I got an 11.5. Even still, these things are way too short. I'd probably have to get a 12.5 in these in order to have a fit.Immediately returned them and will get something else. Probably a pair of Five Ten Freeriders.",73310,3674,3675,2,"I think it is a shame I have to pay to return shoes that are way too small. I buy many different brands from different companies. I have no problem with my size, DC makes shoes ridiculously small. DC has a bad return policy, I wanted to return these for a larger size. No way, you have to reorder a new pair at the going price and pay an outrageous price to return the first pair. I will not buy DC products and I am unhappy with Amazon, they make enough and should make me whole for this purchase. The freight was not a few bucks, it was almost half the price of the shoes. I am very disappointed and will look elsewhere in the future. The buyer should use a size chart reflecting how small these shoes are made and increase the size accordingly.",73311,3675,3676,0,"Despite ordering the next shoe size up as other customers mentioned, these shoes were still too small, so I sent them back and Amazon as usually was very helpful and helped me scedule a free pick-up of the shoes by UPS and provided me with a full refund including tax and shipping. I've heard of needing to order the next shoe size up, but needing to order the next 2 shoe sizes up is unreasonable, and I have doubts even then that the shoes would fit right. I liked the look of these shoes, shoes need to fit right though, not just look good.",73312,3676,3677,1,"Ordered these a 1/2 larger because I read that they ran small in the reviews. However itÂ’s not the length but the toe box width that caused a problem! My right foot was in severe pain after a week. I kept wearing them thinking they would stretch, NOT! My right pinky toe was smashing the next toe over to the point it was red, hard and painful as hell!!!The shoe seems like good quality, loved the style, so it got a star. IÂ’m not confident a larger size would help, the shoe would be too big.There was ample room for the larger toes in the shoe lengthwise, but sides were not wide enough at the toes.",73313,3677,3678,0,"I wear an 8 but since this is only available in half sizes i purchased the 8.5. Just standing still with socks on they fit in length and my toes didnt hit the front of the shoes so i thought great, lets go for a walk. I have average width feet and the toe box on these shoes is HUGE, my feet immediately started sliding around in the shoes from all the space in the toe box, even with socks on. My toes kept smashing up against the front of the shoe and side to side just walking on a flat level sidewalk. I had to turn around and go home just a couple houses down from mine since walking in these was completely impossible. Maybe if you have very wide feet then your feet wont slide around in the front of the shoe, but otherwise if you have medium/average width feet then dont buy these.",73314,3678,3679,1,"I bought these shoes before going on a 6 week trip to Europe. I knew I would be walking a lot and wanted something that would be comfortable on my feet, easy to get in and out of, easy to dry if wet, reasonably priced and stylish.These were none of the above.I wore them for a bit before the trip to break them in, and quickly realized they were not as comfortable as I was hoping they would be. The extra padding in the heel that I thought would be comfy and soothing to my feet, ended up giving me knee pain and 0 support for my foot. The top of the shoe is like a stretchy sock material, which I thought would be great for the reasons listed above, offered NO structural support, and if you're someone who has a slight over pronation on your feet like me, you'll find that the sock-like fabric and the extra padding work against you when trying to correct your pronation. There is NOTHING to keep your foot from sliding sideways and out of the shoe. Now, my feet aren't If anything. the way the padding of the shoe wears as it's broken in over time, it exaggerates the over pronation even more. There is also no treads on the bottom of the shoe, making these even more uncomfortable for walking and hiking in. I was less than a week and a half into my trip when the shoes were so uncomfortable, I marched into an H&M in Helsinki and spent 10 Euros on a pair of generic sneakers, ditching this pair on top of a trash can, hoping maybe they would find some owners that they would be better suited for. I really cannot stress how uncomfortable these were on my feet. Would NOT recommend.",73315,3679,3680,2,"So the first thing I noticed when I opened the bag was the stench. these shoes have not had time to outgas at all before they were zipped in a plastic bag. I""m sure the smell would have gotten better over time, but then I tried them on. I ordered an 8-1/2 and received a 39. I've never had a pair of 8-1/2 shoes not fit, but my toes pushed against the end of the shoe. To make matters worse, the insole is about a half inch too short for the shoe, creating a gap at the end that would surely leave blisters. Such a disappointment since other reviews were so positive. I'm returning them.",73316,3680,3681,1,I would give the seller and shoes a 0 star if I could. I was super excited when I got the shoes so o bought a pair for myself (November) and my mother (January). They advertise that they are Athletic shoes and these shoes are far from being Athletic. I had my shoes for about 6 months and they got holes at the bottom of them. I reached out to the seller to see if they would either give me my money back or replace the shoes. They donÂ’t care about the customers at all. Their response to me was Â“maybe you should have bought a different kind of shoe like Nike or AdidasÂ” And no other shoe company would give you a refund or replacement. Which in fact is not true. They said I had a month if I wasnÂ’t happy I could have returned them. A month Wow!! Really!? There is no way to determine durability in a month. All I did was use the shoes for what they were advertised them for Â“WalkingÂ” I didnÂ’t know there was a limit to how long and how much you walk!*Warning if you use the shoes for walking on pavement or roads you will get holes. These shoes are for soft surface areas only. The shoes are cheaply made....hence the price!,73317,3681,3682,0,"UPDATE* After months of wearing this shoe, as comfortable as they are, the squeak in the right shoe has NOT gone away. I would love to rate them 5 stars but because I now sound like a toddler walking with these shoes, I find myself not wearing them.The shoes themselves fit great and in all honesty are better than I expected. They are super comfortable and I have been wearing them everyday for 2 weeks now. The problem is that the right shoe has a constant squeak sound and it seems to be internally as strange as that sounds. Although I love them, I feel like a little kid when I walk with the squeaky toys inside them so you know where the kid is. Still hoping it will work itself out but 2 weeks in and it isn't looking good.",73318,3682,3683,0,"I wear normal 10.5m in all brands without issue. I own other Under Armour brand shoes in 10.5m. I do not have these issues with any other shoe. This shoe is made for people with narrow feet who are flat footed. The length is the correct size, but it is really tight on the sides and top of my foot. I had difficulty getting the shoe on because it is so tight. This is the first day I have worn the shoes and there are sharp shooting pains in my arches because of a lack of arch support, and it feels like it is cutting off circulation in my foot because of how tight the shoes fit.",73319,3684,3685,0,"The shoes Look great, feel great and they fit great.

The mesh material isn't the same quality as the 6 - it has a cheap, shiny appearance - and the padding in the collar and tongue seems thinner and less plush. They also seem narrower than the 6 in my regular size, but that may improve over time. It's still a decent shoe, but the 6 was overall nicer and was a really good value. Seems like sometimes these model changes are mainly cost-cutting exercises.",73322,3688,3689,0,"I had a similar experience as another reviewer. Three months after I bought these, the glue disintegrated. The stitching became exposed. The stitches held but stretched, allowing the sole to be pulled away just a bit. The side looks very iffy now, especially near the stitches, as though it might rip out at any moment.I wore these shoes in a casual shorts and t-shirts office environment in a desert / San Diego. Heh. No rain or water got to them. So it's unclear why the glue would just fail.I had other Sperry shoes and didn't have much of an issue other than the soles wearing a bit fast. I'll post photos soon.

However, after my husband wore these for a few weeks while teaching, the sole started falling apart on the right shoe. Unfortunately it happened on day 31, so the return window has been closed for this item. Very disappointed in this shoe, especially considering the price. If these were cheap knockoffs, I would think we got what we deserved. However, for $100, this is very troubling. Looking at other reviews, this seems to be a problem that needs to be fixed. Will not be buying again.",73324,3690,3691,1,"Sperry used to be the go to for boat shoes. Now they make cheap crap.This was to replace my 7 year old Bill Fish that wore like iron... everyday, in the summer.. on the boat.The new version of these has crappy leather, cheap laces, and the fit is all messed up (narrow with pointy toes). These used to be functional boat shoes. The new version is even missing the trademark sipping on the treads. Dangerous on a boat without.So if you are a pant pegging, IPA sipping, skinny jean wearing hipster... these are your boat shoes.If you are looking for functional boat shoes that will last, and are actually in use for a boat... Time to find a new shoe.",73325,3691,3692,0,"I used to live in Sperry Top-Siders back in my college days and for years afterwards. They were well made, comfortable and consistent. Admittedly it's probably been a decade since my last purchase. I was shocked at the poor quality of this product. The leather was so thin I was afraid to tie the laces for fear it would tear. The laces were not the leather kind that I was used to back in the day. They were a cheap synthetic cloth, as fragile as the leather upper. I thought perhaps it was just a defective pair, but when I opened the box containing the other Sperry pair (different style/color) I found those to be of equally poor quality. I didn't even bother to try them on. Both pairs went back to Amazon the next day. Thank goodness for free returns.",73326,3692,3693,2,"I washed these hoping to shrink them so that they would fit better. This did not work and I still have to wear 2 pairs of socks to be somewhat comfortable. After washing, the insole color is now bleeding through the white canvas. I had purchased a size 6 medium , my normal size and they were so tight I couldn't get them on so that is why I bought the 6 w and that too doesn't work. I am very dissatisfied with these shoes. I spoke to KED's customer service and they said that these canvas shoes are not made to be washed. I have always washed my sneaks when dirty now she says they are not made to be washed so I would have to wear them dirty or try and sponge wipe them off. I will never buy another pair of KEDS products again. Is there anyway I can send them back to Amazon for a refund? There was no product care instructions with any of the KEDS that I purchased to warn me to not wash them.",73327,3694,3695,1,"I bought these for my wife. She wears size 8.5. She also has a pair that we bought from a retail store. The ones we bought from Amazon, were really uncomfortable on her. I told her to break em in. It's probably because they're new. Meanwhile... It's been several months, and still not fitting right! I said, ""let's check the tags"", ""maybe one is ""narrow"", and one is wide""? Checked the tags. Tags were different.. One was imprinted on the canvas, the other, an ""iron on sticker"". After that I did some digging. There were several variances in the two shoes. I have reason to believe that these shoes are fakes. My wife's owned several pairs of these EXACT shoes over the years, and they've never had this issue. Buyer beware. I would buy from a brick and mortar store for something like this in the future.",73328,3695,3696,0,"I bought these Keds a while back and only opened them this week for a vacation. The return window has closed of course. I should have inspected them when they arrived. One of the two shoes was very dirty. It had spots on it that actually looked like urine! As well as smudges, I noticed when I wore them that I got black spots on the top of my feet. Turned out there was some sort of black marker on the inside of the tongue of each of the shoes that was coming off on my foot. Looked like some sort of marking for seconds.",73329,3696,3697,2,"okay so this is the second pair of keds i've ordered, and i am really dissapointed! With the first pair, i noticed that he rubber was pulling away from the sole after only a few months of owning. I don't wear these everyday, only when i'm running errands. Anyway I thought maybe they are just a bad apple, and ordered again. Let me tell you, they are poorly made! Not only is the rubber pulling away from the soles, but now the fabric is fraying and there's a hole. I am NEVER ordering again...what happened to the quality of these shoes? They were the only shoes I wore in high school, and they never fell apart the way these do!",73330,3697,3698,0,"So, I bought this as a Christmas gift for my family. We did not get around playing it for several months. So you can imagine how disappointed I wS when I got around to play the ring toss with my family that one of the boards was very badly warped and the paint was not on all the way. Very cheap and disappointed. Went to exchange the item and it had been too long, so I could not exchange. Great concept otherwise. It folds nicely into the bag provided, so it would be easy to take to the park or beach.",73331,3698,3699,0,It's smaller than I expected but it appears to be made with quality materials. I'd prefer it more if the price was only $15 but hey what can u do?We got it for the beach to add to variety to our sand games.The setup is easy (although you do have to take a minute to screw in the 5 rods to the base). The game is easy for kids to understand and the kids liked it. Its also easy to transport.I like the option to use rope or plastic rings and there are a lot of rings.We looked at a lot of other ring games on amazon and i do believe this is probably the best option. Again it would be nice if it was just a bit larger but otherwise it's good.,73332,3699,3700,0,"I got this for a group of kids and adults to play with during bbq hang out. Its a pretty good value, its super easy to put together and seems sturdy enough. My only complaint is the weight on the rings. The plastic rings are more or less worthless, unless you are a toddler who just walks over there and places it on top. They are to small and light to throw and if you happen to get it in place they tend to jump right off. The rope rings are better, but still wish they had more weight to them. You better hope it isn't a windy day when you want to play. The bag is great, which is the reason I chose this particular brand.",73333,3700,3701,1,"Updated review** I can't express enough how disappointed I am with this game. I wrote the review below after using the ring toss game three times with my family. Everyone liked this game and I have received numerous requests for info on where to purchase. During the fourth time playing this game one of the wooden screws broke when we simply tried to unscrew the peg and put in in the storage case. Usually we keep the parts together and do not unscrew them because it seems flimsy. NotOnly did it break, the wooden pieces are still stuck in the bottom of the board so even if we receive a replacement peg we still can't use the board. What a major disappointment and this game was way too expensive at over $20 to break after four uses. Very dissapointed customer. My kids are sad because they really enjoyed this game and I was using this as something fun that we could do throughout the summer as we spend a lot of time at the park and the kids enjoy this type of game. I do not recommend this product but I hope they can make better parts because it was fun while it lasted.First review***Came with all the parts as advertised. It took about a minute to screw the pegs in the holes and we were playing. Kids and adults loved it. The ropes seem sturdy so far and we also use the plastic rings that came with it. I love the carrying case although we only store the ropes and rings in there. The wooden pieces we keep those screwed together and we just hang it on the wall on our patio so we don't have to keep putting it together. Having it like that certainly means my kids play with it more often.",73334,3701,3702,0,"This is a great game for the entire family and a good way to ""unplug"" from electronics and other gadgets. The game itself no doubt deserves 5 stars.However, I am disappointed with the workmanship. I have bought many wooden toys and games, and from the positive reviews I had high expectations. (1) One of the wooden sticks in my set does not screw into the slot all the way so is left slightly wobbly; (2) the X-section has uneven wood chips sticking out so I recommend having an adult to do the assembly so to avoid splinters on little hands; (3) the green carry bag is a great idea and helps for bringing the game to grandma's home but the zipper is of poor quality and broke after 2 uses; and (4) the ring tosses are made of a very rough rope material and little bits stick out and poke against little hands.",73335,3702,3703,1,"Poor quality. Not accurately described. If used in the Context of why someone would purchase this, you'd do as well with a cardboard box with holes cut and throw old golf balls, etc. This is so cheaply made its hard to believe it's on Amazon, and handled by them. For this money, OMG so expensive, -- and where made, I don't get why not used recycled composite plastic board, -- it would hold up/last and be more formally festive (why I purchased for July 4th weekend...). Again, otherwise, paint a cardboard box up and throw bars of soap. Very very disappointed.",73336,3703,3704,1,"We ordered this item for a christmas morning present. When I opened the box to put it together on xmas eve, I found several of the legs to be broken on this item and others not to fit or stay in place. It was a large disappointment. Given the $35 price tag, I would expect these legs to be made more sturdy It is cheap plastic that clearly breaks on its own.Additionally, I emailed the company about this problem and still haven't heard back from them weeks later. I would not recommend this in the least!",73337,3704,3705,0,This bean bag toss game is really small. For $40.00 we expected to receive a nice backyard game. Unfortunately this game did not meet our expectations. It's really a game for small children that I wouldn't expect to pay more than $20.00 for. The legs are very flimsy and we keep having problems with them staying on and the game remaining stable. This is something I would expect to find in a pre-school setting for toddlers. I have teens and they were not impressed.,73338,3705,3706,0,"I ordered this a week before Christmas, as a gift for my nephew.. It was received in a larger box with many other items. I nevered opened the game box itself, I just wrapped it with the other gifts and put everything under the tree.

I never thought to look in the box, there was no damage to the box or anything else I received with this game.",73339,3706,3707,0,"Bought for Easter so I was unable to just box it back up for return. The fact that it arrived damaged was pretty disappointing. The boards are heavy, the black side is a nice foam. The ""wood"" side is like drawer liner, a wood sticker paper. The thin board underneath was chipped on mine. The paint around the holes was also coming off (but I can repaint that).The bags are just small basic bean bags, the washers are decent weight plastic washers.I'd recommend this but buy far enough in advance to open and return should it be chipped.",73340,3707,3708,0,"We received this cracked which is probably not the norm but worth mentioning. We thought this was great product. We have two kids that love connect for and decided this would be a great back yard addition.A few drawbacks/ reasons for the loss of stars:- It is not very movable. The board slides in to the leg supports and if you wanted to move it you have to move it as a whole unit. Being that it so large it's not the easiest to move two legs and the board while keeping it together.- The method to empty the board is not the most user friends. It can only be opened from one side of the playing board.- We worried about the wear of it being outside. We are located in the hot and humid state of Florida and worried about the wood / particle board warping. We get rain showers everyday, often unannounced so this was a huge factor for us.Pros:- Large colorful pieces- The carrying case is super convenient and well made.",73341,3708,3709,0,"I purchased this item over 2 years ago for my Luxury vacation rental and have had it repaired three times since. the design is highly flawed, it is not intuitive to new players what the mechanism is to dislodge the pieces, therefore new users try to figure out how to release pieces and by the time they figure it out, bit by bit guests weaken the integrity of the game. i have drawn arrows and written directions on the game in an effort to assist new players how to release the pieces.

In my very first session the frame of the net cracked in THREE separate places and as a result I have had to tape each of the cracks and attempt to continue to play. This frame uses extremly cheap, hollow, TPU tubes that easily crack and break.Although I love this game, I cannot in good faith recommend this product to anyone I know.",73345,3713,3714,1,"I had previously given this a 4 star rating. Not 5 due to the over-cost. However, after my sons played it a handful of times, they quickly got bored and said it just sucked. They actually played only a few times and we packed away for the year in our storage. They decided to give it another shot this year (after I complained about how much I spent on it) and the main outer ring snapped in half. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. Extremely disappointed. They now play croquet and KanJam almost daily.Purchased at my 20 yr. old son's request. Played once with friends and said we ""have"" to have it for our group of boys. They LOVE it. However, I feel it is super over-priced. A plastic base with a net and 1 ball for $60 was not easy for me to swallow. Also, I was disappointed to see that the ball barely bounces......looked for a way to perhaps tighten the net. The ball is fully inflated. All in all, a fun game for them to play and for us to watch. Hopefully, the price will come down as I foresee a replacement in the near future.",73346,3714,3715,0,This is a fun game however the net sucks. I would not recommend spending the money on this. Especially since we are always re-stretching out the net and it just does not have enough bounce to it. We seriously have had more fun with a small exercise tramp and racquetballs and get a better result. Just my opinion maybe we are playing it wrong and don't really understand the game but I think if it had a better net or bouncing system it would be awesome and more worth the money. This is really cheap in my opinion. Sorry and Thanks.,73347,3715,3716,0,"I was so disappointed with this; I really wanted to love it. The concept it great; it just feels like the quality of materials were not worth the $50 we spent on it. The netting shredded on the edges as soon as we wrapped it around the bar to secure it. We couldn't get it tight enough to really make the ball bounce but didn't want to risk tearing it more. In reading the review, perhaps there is an upgrade version floating around. We were able to purchase a similar game at Target on clearance for $2.50 that was made of metal and a strong mesh that worked 10x better than this. Thankfully we tried it out before throwing the box away or leaving on vacation (where we'd planned to use it).",73348,3716,3717,1,***DON'T THROW AWAY THE BOX***I consider myself a pro when putting things together. When it came to this I felt like an idiot. It seems simple but the issue is the net and the flimsy yellow legs.The net pulled tight makes everything draw in. Therefore the legs do NOT stand up like in this picture. It's more lopsided.If you loosen it then the balls won't bounce!!! The net is to cheap. Trust me there is no in between.

I'd return had we not throw the box away. :(.,73349,3717,3718,2,"I did not buy this item because after researching it throughout the web, the problem is that you don't know what you're actually getting. If you look at the Walmart site, it shows the ""ful size premium bocce set"" has the 100mm balls (3.93"") for $50, another full size (but not premium) for $45 and a regular set that has 90mm balls (3.5"") at $35. However, here on Amazon, the title shows this as a full size set, but in the description it mentions 3.5"" balls. From the reviews, it looks like many people expected 100mm and got 90mm balls, except for the last person. So that's not enough information for me to buy them here at Amazon. I ended up getting my set on the Hayneedle site, which has many sets to choose from, good prices and free shipping. Also, someone mentioned this set doesn't have the right etching marks to play with the right number of players. I didn't know what this meant since I'm new to bocce, until I went on the Hayneedle site. Those are the lines on the balls (the design). On the pic for this product, there are only green and red balls and they all have the same design, which means that you can only play with 2 people or two teams or you won't be able to tell the balls apart. The Hayneedle site shows this exact Trademark set for $49 but with 2 different etching designs. That means you can play with 4 people. I ended up going with a similar set for $45 (I liked the colors better).",73350,3718,3719,0,"I can't believe Amazon put this in a box and mailed it as a new item, how disappointing!

Sending me someones return is not a way to do business. Also, there was not anything packaged that showed us any company info, who this was made by etc. There was not even an invoice in my box! Fathers Day fail big time! Top that off with searching the Amazon site endlessly so I could call and talk to someone in person about this, they have made it impossible to find any way to connect with a human!

I'd like to see if I can return/ get a replacement for this as it should have a longer life than playing with it a few times. Please let me know how we can resolve this. Also balls scratch very easily on this, which is really interesting as well. It chipped again the time I just reused it. I asked for a refund and was charged a re-stocking fee. I would like to be given the restocking fee back since I would like to purchase a more expensive better version of this.",73352,3721,3722,0,These intermediate set of Bocce Balls are better than the small and lighter family Bocce Balls and the heavier and larger regulation Bocce Balls.

Half of the wristbands broke before we ever got outside to play. We tried putting them back together, but they kept falling apart while players were running. Additionally, a couple of the light up territory lights moved in their casings and now can't be shut and therefore turned on, rendering them useless. One of the orbs fell apart the first time it was captured, and we lost the non-glowing portion in the darkness.

It was pretty expensive, too...and since I wasnÂ’t told about the defect (as my sister didnÂ’t want to hurt my feelings), we missed the return/exchange deadline.

We had 20+ 10-11 year old boys to play capture the flag for a birthday party. One orb kept stopped working which was basically a game stopper. The wristbands donÂ’t stay on and would frequently break. I spend so much time dealing with the wristbands that donÂ’t work well and unsnap easily then break. The markers also didnÂ’t all work correctly and took about 20+ minutes to get some to work. This has good potential but the quality of the products is low.

It will certainly serve its purpose but I thought I had been buying an identical mat to the one I had seen in person. This one was very cheaply made. The lines are printed on not a part of the fabric itself. I thought the mat would be woven but it is a ribbed knit.

It's the first product I've ever HOPED would just simply break. Not in any way like the original Jarts (which I think was banned for being dangerous). These darts have no points; they sail inelegantly through the air, and only for a short distance; it's impossible to toss the jarts more than about 15-20 feet; and, finally, they have no points at all, to speak of, so they just kind of land in a dead weight flop on the ground.On the other hand, they can be got for [...], so if your kids are very young, they just might be fooled for awhile into thinking this is a pretty cool toy.",73364,3733,3734,0,"This is awful and I'm quite disappointed. Bought these for use overseas. First game, ruined. As another reviewer mentioned, within a few throws one of them has the vane sliding off on every throw. Another one had the vane split slightly close to the head of the Jart. how can a company sell a product that would break so quickly? How can Amazon allow them to keep doing business here? It would cost me more to return it than it's worth at this point.",73365,3734,3735,0,"Jarts were first sold in the early 1970s. Even then, there was controversey over potential danger and a deal was struck with the FDA (jarts were food or drug?) to mark all products with language similar to ""not a toy/adult use only"" and not to be sold in toy departments. This was executed with less than 100% success.Fast forward to 1988 and a 7-year old girl became the 3rd death as a result of a jart accident -- thrown by her 9-year-old brother and friends; no adult supervision. The grief-stricken father decided that three deaths was one death too many and successfully lobbied Congress and the consumer product safety council to ban jarts.So, there you go. Three deaths over ~15 years, all resulting from the mis-use of a ""not for kids"" sporting good. There were, of course, many non-fatal injuries, too ... but those data have been debated by both sides. In 1997, another child was struck in the head and was in a coma, prompting the CPSC to reissue the ban notification, encouraging anyone possessing contraband jarts to destroy them.In any event, such as with seatbelt laws, we have agreed that we need protection from ourselves and allowed laws to govern our actions. Yippee. As with all officially banned or recalled products, sale and trade of jarts is illegal per federal law (no ebay, no garage sale, etc.).The new product bounces all over the place, which defeats the purpose of jarts (which stuck right were it first landed). Gets really boring, really fast. Stick to the other yard games, such as cornhole, for a better experience. Unfortunatley, jarts is an adult game that is tied to the ability to stick into the ground ... which is too dangerous for Americans and Canadians.",73366,3735,3736,1,"Cheap, unbalanced, cheap, not worth a purchase, If you ever used the old Jarts, just keep the memory and don't expect anything close to the old and dangerous! This is just 4 pieces of plastic that has almost like a spring in the tip and a little bit of sand or weight to make them fly. But Fly they don't! I have 6-8-20 year old grandsons... none want to play with these. Papa...Bring out the cornhole game! So we did, and played for hours. Again, don't waste your time thinking this will be anything close to the Jart game we all remember.",73367,3737,3738,0,"My main reason for giving this a 2 star rating is the price. $60 for two pieces of plastic(even though its thick, durable plastic), 4 balls(basically racquetballs), and a net is a little steep. I would say $40 is the most I would reasonably pay for this type of game, but even then I would wait for a deal. My daughter had 3 friends friends over today. Thankfully it was 3 friends because you need EXACTLY 4 people to play(a con in my opinion). After 5 minutes they gave up because no one could make it into the net. These girls are ages 9-10...so they're not exactly older, but they're not teenie tiny, uncoordinated children either. I thought it was a little bit too hard for them, though I would think this game should be suitable for this age group. After watching them, I'm thinking 13+ might be a better age to play this game. Whether or not this is a good value would depend on how highly you value outdoor activities with your kids/friends. My family enjoys darts, archery, riding scooters, bikes...this game isn't going to be beating any of those anytime soon.",73368,3738,3739,0,"The RampShot Backyard Game is a good idea for a fun game and because of the large set up area and the semi hard balls used, it is definitely an outdoor game.What I am going to address in this review is the assembly of the units. It consists of two large plastic ramps which appear very well made and will likely last with some rough play. There are nets included which fit into the large rectangular holes in the ramps. The nets are not attached. This is where the ball is caught when playing the game. Also included are the four balls.The problem is to attach the nets to some plastic hooks, which surround the large rectangular hole in the ramp. The hooks are inside small holes which surround the large rectangular hole in the ramp.The is a rubber bungee cord which surrounds the net. The net is to be evenly placed around the cord, which is fairly easily done, but not without some work. Then... the cord is to be inserted and hooked onto the plastic hooks all around the out side of the large ramp hole. The first few are easy to attach, but as you move around the rectangular hole the cord gets stretched tighter.The directions say to use a key or other flat object to insert the cord. I ended up with two flat screw drivers and spent about 45 minutes working the cord into the holes and over the hooks. I made sure the screw drivers were not sharp so they wouldn't cut the cord. As I was doing this I kept wondering which was going to break first, the cord, my resolve, or the plastic hooks. It was a hook. They are not very tough. I did get it done to a point that the game is playable with only one broken hook and two rather bent ones.I question why the nets were not attached by the manufacturer. Later... After thinking the whole process over, I came up with a simple tool which could be used to attach the net cord. It is something that could be produced by the manufacturer cheaply and included with the set, or you could make it from a clothes hanger wire. I've included a sketch. The tool could be inserted into the bottom of each hole in the ramp and then looped over the cord and pulled back through and over the plastic hooks. This would be a very cheap fix to the assembly problem.",73369,3739,3740,0,So the ball does not respond off of the ramp even remotely close to how it does in the video. I just don't see what we are possibly doing wrong. We are throwing the ball the same way and same speed as it appears in the video - but the ball does not even come close to responding off of the ramp like in the video.The game was pretty disappointing. My friends were all asking - are we doing something wrong here?I admit - maybe we are doing it wrong - but we really are not enjoying this game.,73370,3740,3741,2,"It's ok, not a bad game, not a great game.It's spring here in Phoenix, which means enjoy the outdoors as much as you can now. I thought this would be a great addition to our family backyard games. My son was anxious to play which made assembly even more infuriating. If he hadn't been hovering, I would have stopped and walked away. I used a screwdriver and my fingers. I found that looping the bungee cord with my fingers and pushing it in with the flat-headed screwdriver worked pretty well. As I was installing, I found that the net bunches in areas as you work. I got completely done with the first ramp only to have the net completely bunched at one end, which meant I had to disconnect and undo the entire net from the ramp. <U+0001F629> That was when I wanted to chuck it over the fence. There is a QR code on the instructions, so I tried scanning that to see if there was additional video or directions for assembly. It took me to the online instructions, which was the exact same instructions I held in my hand, just scanned in on a website. I thought that was pretty silly because in order to scan the QR code I needed the paper in my hand (which has since blown away or has been misplaced). Anyway, the online directions were not any more helpful.Last is to attach the stickers to the front. I still haven't done this. The ramps had dust on them from the shipping process and needed to be wiped down to ensure they adhere properly. My son didn't have the patience for that after the whole net procedure, so I didn't put them on and I haven't since.The game itself was ok. We only had 3 people to play, so since we didn't have teams, we adapted the game. We didn't play long and lost interest quickly. My son has since gone out and played with it by himself trying to throw the ball into the net. (I will add that the video on how to play was helpful after I understood how it was supposed to work. The first time I watched the video, I was overwhelmed with the names of the positions and honestly, a little confused. It makes more sense after you play and then watch the video again.)Overall, I think it would be difficult to justify the $60 price tag for this game. I think some of the excitement was lost during the frustrating set-up. My son watched the video after playing and said it looked like more fun on the video. I have to agree with him.",73371,3741,3742,0,"Â In opening, I will say that this game is a fun game and unique. A good game for a party. It was more fun for the older kids and adults. But, it can be adapted as just a ""toss in"" game for the little ones. Once this thing was put together, it was fine. My main issue was with putting it together. If the nets would have come already installed this would be a 5-star review.I had some issues on the initial install of this item. The game consists of two heavy duty plastic bases, and two nets that is ringed with an elastic rubber band type piece. You have to get the rubber band/elastic into these hooks and there isn't much room for your fingers to do this, especially when you've gotten half of them installed. My attempt was an utter failure.My husband managed to be all manly and took it over and finished it. So, judge away, it was hard for me with fingernails to do this. He did break out a flathead screwdriver though. So, he technically cheated. They could make installing the net a bit easier, in my opinion. Or it could come preinstalled.Secondly, the two bases came cracked out of the box. This could be a shipping issue, maybe the UPS guy dropped it. But the cracks were almost identical on both bases. It took us almost an hour to set this game up, when it should be easy. We weren't trying to put together furniture. If we would have broken this out at a party - the guests would have lost interest quickly.",73372,3742,3743,0,"Looks great in the pictures. However, the final product is lackluster. They seem to be cut with a machine, however the final product with the die numbers leaves much to be desired. Is it burned in? Some are way darker that others. Guess I'll have to break out the stain. As well no finish? So I throw these in my yard and they will absorb water and grass stains? For six 3.5 inch die and spending $50, I would have expected more. This is almost a garage project where I would have produced a much better product. Maybe I will?",73373,3744,3745,0,"They were irregularly shaped, each different and with unequal sides. They had numerous significant cracks. The dots were burned on, but done very poorly (some deep and some barely visible).I had bought them as part of a Christmas gift for an uncle who collects dice, but there was no way I'd give him these, so I returned them. Totally ruined my plans for him.

I thought (hoped) this would be the bomb when I first got it. While the ""storable portability"" seems like a good idea,(and it COULD BE), the quality and design of this one is C-H-E-A-P. The telescoping poles are a {fragile} pain; the poles don't exactly extend out evenly without contorting the luggage part (the base), and the pins are hard to line-up to pop into the holes. The base of the unit (the luggage) has to be held down by large rocks/bricks to keep it stable. Speaking of the luggage, its not very durable either, just fragile thin vinyl. Also, after 1 year of having this (stored inside thru winter), the piping (red edges) of the net has completely deteriorated(!!!) rendering this useless! I am now desperately trying to find where I can get a replacement net to fit these poles, but none exists(!) I will have to buy a seperate net (as I had to buy seperate shuttlecocks), so ultimately, the raquet is the only part of this set that is a 'keeper'. One final thing, the shuttlecocks that come with this are awful; cheapo plastics that dont really make the game satisfying to play. I had to order some nicer more functional ones.

The gift that I gave to my friend broke the first time it was used and mine are already having heavy wear around the extendable arms where they connect to the base with the first use. I like how easily it sets up, but it is difficult to take down. The areas where the extendable net arms clip into the base is difficult to fit the end of the net arms in to the base holes and the removal almost broke the spring clips on both sets because of the amount of pressure needed to get the extendable arms unclipped. The net is not regulation size (20 feet), the net is 11 feet wide, as can be assumed when buying because this is a compact item. The Kit is very light and easy to travel with but blows down easily in light winds which isn't really a problem given it is so easy to lift back up after being knocked down or you can place a heavy item in the bottom to help keep it from blowing over as the instructions suggest. The problem is the thin plastic that the arms are made from allow for a weak area that is not flexible enough to withstand much tension either from the net pulling the arms in toward each other like a bow or the winds causing extra stress and can cause the plastic to break. It needs reinforcement at each joint in the extendable net arms to be a better performing product. Perhaps large pieces of shrink tubing around where the clips of each extendable section connect together and it might be sturdier.",73385,3757,3758,0,"I opened the box to find 2 of the 4 bags not fully sewn together.

It's made in china and certainly cheaply made, but for $20 it should provide a fun activity for the kids and hold up.Should the replacement also have defective bags, I will post an update.",73386,3758,3759,0,"When I first saw how small it was I was disappointed that they would charged that much for something that is maybe 2 feet. I thought it would be at least 4 feet since you have to throw something at it. I didn't think this was something you would have to throw down at or sit on the floor and throw the squares. The velcro on the squares sticks really well and is made nicely, and my daughter who is 19 months loves it, but I wish it was taller especially for that price.",73387,3759,3760,0,"I really want to give this more stars but, in my opinion, there is a pretty serious design flaw with it.First off, it's a little smaller than you might expect, but that's easy to deal with. The legs support it well and it can take a hit and not fall over. The bean bags are well stitched also and look like they could take a couple years of abuse easily.The problem is the super human strength you need to get the bean bags off the turtle. My three year old isn't strong enough to do it yet and I feel like I'm trying to tear a dish cloth in half when I do it. These bean bags could hold a door on a car. I honestly didn't know velcro could be so strong. As a result I tend to avoid this toy when I'm looking for something to do with my daughter just because her interaction with it it limited and I feel like I'm going to break it.",73388,3760,3761,1,"Not worth the price, very cheaply made..

My daughter loves throw in the bean bags at the turtle. Unfortunately, she lost her balance and fell on the stand. It broke in half. Needless to say, we are disappointed.

Started with 12, down to just three in less than a month.The DuraFast 40 is the ball of choice for tournaments and I have come to suspect that it is simply for economic reasons between the top tournaments and the brand. Simply put, these balls are terrible, they quickly wear out and do not last at all.Compared to the Onix Pure 2, which is a superior ball that is both durable and consistent, these DuraFast 40 belong in only one place - the trash bin.I certainly do not want to bash the company fulfilling the order as I received the balls quickly and efficiently.I urge all pickleball players to boycott these balls.

Yes, I am a 4.5 plus player and hit hard but that is no excuse. The problem with this game and many share the sentiment is this ridiculous ball situation. Whoever donates or bribes their way into sanctioned events have suddenly become the ball of record that month.These balls are fast I give them that. But cracking after a couple of games is unacceptable. ""Dura""...just comical.",73392,3765,3766,0,"A new ball plays well, at least for the majority of your first game. However, typically by game two the balk has lost its shape and will in all likelihood crack prior to games end. I am extremely disappointed in this balls performance.

The flimsy bottom rubber piece you place the plastic pole into is too short to ring the horseshoes around and was bent from being inside the box and wouldn't lay flat. We tried to play anyway and found that every time you got the horseshoe near the pole, it would bounce off or just knock the pole over. This certainly was not worth the cost, even being under $20. Then, I was shocked to find out the packaging indicates ""This product is made with chemicals known to cause cancer in the State of California!...What???!!!

As it is, the drink holders that I received are far to big for a 12 oz can, or even a 20 oz Solo cup. It is very difficult to remove a drink once it is placed in the holder. Disappointing. It could be used for a 16 oz (or larger) bottle of water/soda, but holding it rather loosely. There are actual customer pictures showing what I am trying to describe, so give a look in the reviews.

The bean bags are ""lighter weight"" than standard corn hole bags...and that is because...2. The boards themselves cannot support the weight of standard corn hole bags beating against them. We have some standard bags and the boards do not seem to tolerate them well.3. The bean bags are made from a slick, satin-like fabric...and one of ours is coming apart after only a couple days of use.4. The boards are so lightweight and do not have proper [rubber] footing, so they do not stay put...at least on non-carpeted flooring.I wish I had invested in a sturdier set.",73412,3787,3788,2,"I bought this in hopes I could pack it up and take it places. The boards do not stay together to do that. They are constantly falling apart and you lose the bean bags. Also the legs are super flimsy and don't hold up well. The board is also extremely slippery and I don't think the slope is correct so almost always the bags fly right off. I should have spent the extra money on a better set. This is a definite you get what you pay for and trying to go a little cheaper wasn't worth it. I compared it by having a better set (someone else's set) next to this one and had the same people tossing the bean bags, and the other set held them much better. Also the little kids always love to play this at picnics and its too frustrating for them even standing closer to the board because everything slips so easily. I guess if you want a real tough version of the game this is for you, but don't expect to take it everywhere you go.",73413,3788,3789,1,"Better off making one yourself. Yes, the graphics are nice but that's about it. Not worth the money at all.The cheapest wood possible is used throughout. And it's heavy to boot. The legs that hold it up are the worst part.There is maybe $20 of wood and materials, tops used in the product. It's basically junk with pretty graphics. I'm keeping ours I think and changing the legs. They barely hold up this game and I guarantee you they will break first and soon.This is a cheaply made board. I can't recommend it.

Contacting me at my business to guilt me into changing my review? Zero stars. YouÂ’re killing your own dream.We've had various fishing sets at our pediatric therapy clinic. From the photo and description, I liked that this set included nets and multiple fish. I didn't expect it to include a duck or sea turtle. I had to explain to a preschooler today why a baby sea turtle was used as bait. The plastic looks/feels cheap. The poles worked OK, but the magnetic design could be improved. The magnets and screws are very small.",73416,3794,3795,1,"IÂ’m not really sure how the reviews are so high but this fish set is poor quality and a choking hazard. #1 the metal piece in each fish that the magnet attaches to is a very small SCREW, hence if it fell out would be a choking hazard. #2 there are small yellow circles down the poles that the string goes through that are not glued on, they constantly pop off and are annoying to have to constantly put back on, and another choking hazard. #3 the plastic is thin hollow and not hard or durable. In the first day one of the fish was dented and the pole snapped just from light play. IÂ’m returning this item, IÂ’m very disappointed.

They are the only Acer products I have ever bought, and they are the only ones I will ever buy. The first was a Helios 300. Though their service professionals are amiable enough their ability to help is hamstrung by Acer's policies. The only recourse anyone ever has with their product is to ship it in to their repair centers where the the initial level of diagnostics is totally insufficient. My first laptop had a motherboard problem but they sent it back to me without repair. The problem persisted and they had to elevate my problem to someone who actually sounded like they knew anything about computers. I finally got a usable computer a full month and half after I ordered which makes one ask if I should even both with Amazon's 2-day shipping. The second laptop has a bad HDD. I KNOW it's a bad HDD. I've confirmed it in several different ways and just want to replace the HDD. I'm overseas and sending it in will cost more than the laptop is worth, but does that matter? Nope. Will the service representative refer me to a supervisor? Nope. Their ONLY recourse they're allowed is send it in. If you won't send it in, we won't do anything about the bad HDD we gave you. If you get a functional laptop you probably will never have to deal with these folks, but I'm batting a 1000 on Acer products here with failed hardware shipped in them. Either I'm extremely unlucky, or Acer's quality control is the worst I've ever seen.",73418,3796,3797,2,"I set my expectations low with the price point of this laptop, but expected it to function at the very least. Unfortunately it cannot. ItÂ’s incredibly slow, which isnÂ’t a big deal, expected at $360, but it will not update. I cannot get windows to update. I had it downloading updates for 5 hours and the final download wouldnÂ’t pass 6% even after sitting for over an hour for this download alone. If you use the internet at all do not purchase this. Web pages take a while to load, or wonÂ’t load completely, regardless of browser. Meanwhile I hop on my desktop, phone, any other device and the internet works flawless so I know my internet is fine. Went through and updated all the drivers without any success. Videos wonÂ’t load either. Yeah, the screen is 1080p, but if you try to watch a random youtube video at just 720p, it cannot go more than 5-10 seconds without buffering for 3-4x that amount. I tried resetting the laptop and have spent hours attempting to make this work. Maybe a defective model, but something is definitely wrong. My old HP Pavilion that was 5 years old worked better. If you purchase this laptop make sure you have a smartphone or something so you can watch youtube videos to bypass the wait of loading your favourite homepage or email.Aside from all of the cons, the battery life seems decent. Probably because the computer is barely functional and the battery is quite literally just powering the screen. I think the HDD takes a nap or something once it wears itself out from starting up.Touchpad is okay, fairly responsive, comfortable to use. This is definitely a place where you feel what you paid for, same goes for the keyboard.Keyboard is okay, Caps Lock doesnÂ’t light up or anything so it always keeps you guessing when entering passwords for online accounts. Who knew logging into websites could be a fun game! Nonetheless the keyboard feels cheap as to be expected.Picture quality is decent. If videos would load iÂ’m sure the laptop wouldnÂ’t be too bad for simple tasks, using word, very light internet surfing, staring at your 240 I mean 1080p background picture.Startup is slow, even after removing the bloatware, resetting windows, I can still cook myself dinner and by the time iÂ’ve finished I can finally log into my dinosaur er I mean laptop.I was going to install an SSD but alas I canÂ’t help but feel it would be a wasted effort. No point in putting a fresh heart into a dying body.Sound quality, I shouldnÂ’t even have to address this. Its a laptop, they shouldnÂ’t even come with internal speakers at this point. Buy an externet speaker set. I got an Amazon Basics set 4 or so years ago and they work pretty well. Not perfect, but a huge upgrade for $15.Overall feels worth it for ~$360 if you receive a working model. Acer needs to either up their QC or address some defects. Maybe the defective models simply get routed right back with the working ones and shipped out. Who knows.",73419,3797,3798,0,"I hesitate to leave such a horrible review but it has been a 5 day nightmare for me and it does't seem to be over yet. The browser would close on its own and open a random window that I did not open. I heard myself talking through the laptop speakers and looked behind the window I had open and was staring back at myself because the computer had opened Skype all by itself. Suddenly, I couldn't open any items on the desktop. The cursor would move but clicking on items wouldn't open them. It wouldn't type into the search bar, and the Windows Icon (far bottom left) wouldn't open to allow me to reboot. I had to force reboot by holding the power button (which I hate to do). Then, the ""restarting"" wheel just swirled and swirled... When I tried to backup my files by plugging in my external hard drive, it recognized it okay and opened the window to show the files, while I was looking it, it suddenly closed that window and opened another window. Then, while transferring files from the laptop to the external drive, I started getting the message, ""Are you sure you want to save this file without its properties""? WTH? Also, when I clicked the Windows Icon (lower left) that opens to show the programs in alphabetic order, suddenly before my eyes, all names and icons of the programs disappeared and a random alphabet appears... A B C D etc with no names or icons. But, when I clicked the Windows Icon again, it all came back. It literally felt like there was a ghost in the laptop or someone was controlling it from elsewhere. I have been on the phone with Amazon, Acer, and even Microsoft Windows. I had already spent two days re-installing all my files and software (winzip, video editing software, Microsoft Word, Norton) only to ultimately restore Windows to factory settings while on the phone with Microsoft. This is when the problem occurred while trying to backup my files to the external drive... which caused me to fear that my external device was now corrupted. That device held 8 years of research with documents and images I had created. It held the backup of 4 books I had written, the family tree book I had been working on since 2012, and all our ancestors photos I had restores and only I had this family data. I had my wedding photos and photos of my deceased mother who just passed and my deceased brother who died in 1976 in a car accident, my daughter's baby pictures... So, I was horrified when I plugged the drive in after the factory restore and got the message that the external drive was not recognized. Thankfully! Thankfully! My brother helped me retrieve my data from it. I had bought my husband the exact same laptop but from another vendor and his didn't have these problems. The seal on my laptop had not been broken but Amazon customer service had said, ""So, you bought this on Nov 14th"". No... I bought it on Nov 29th. Then she said, ""No problem, I'll just change that for you"". Which makes me wonder what happened between Nov 14th and the 29th? A fluke? Last night around 1am, my Kindle starts alerting me of Yahoo email login failures and something about failures to log into Amazon through my Yahoo email. This is a full 5 days after this all started. So, at 2 am I up changing all my passwords to every account I own; my bank, Paypal, Amazon, Yahoo email... etc'. I have demanded that Acer investigate by tracing the laptop though its SN number but am told they can't do that. It is their responsibility to ensure that their customer receive a clean computer. I have been emotionally exhausted, emotionally distraught, mentally exhausted and physically exhausted and I shouldn't have had to go through this. Customers should't have to restore their laptop Windows back to factory settings. But, my husband's laptop was fine. Somebody, somewhere, did something to the laptop I received and I feel it should be investigated. Maybe this feedback will make that happen. Or, maybe they will just come after me instead. That would be a lot easier than tracing where their corrupted laptop came from.",73420,3798,3799,0,"Summary:Computer sits at 100% disk usage for a majority of it's operation, even with no applications running. This causes it to be so slow it is unusable.I have built a couple of computers previously, work as an IT Consultant, and generally am decently technologically savvy when it comes to computers. The specs on this computer seemed pretty decent for the price, but the performance is terrible. None of the 100% disk usage fixes worked.The computer sits at 100% disk usage, possibly dropping down to 99% disk usage, before jumping back up to 100%. This occurs even if the only application open is Task Manager to monitor the disk usage. I have had 4 different computers, 3 of them laptops, running windows 10 before and never run into this issue. After doing some research, it looks like this isn't an unheard of issue with multiple guides and reddits discussing the problem. I tried everything I could find, from disabling the WPR system collector, turning off windows search, turning off superfetch, running Check Disk, resetting the virtual memory, etc. No solutions worked. I contacted Acer feeling defeated I was unable to fix it. My thought was that it was probably a hardware issue at this point. Acer wanted me to run through all the same fixes, so I did. Then they wanted me to create a windows boot drive and try with a fresh, clean install. I did that too, without success. When I contacted them again, they wanted me to ship the computer to them to fix. Unfortunately the shipping cost isn't included. At this point I've been trying to get this computer working like it should have out of the box for several months. I'll have to pay more for them to potentially fix it. I think it would make more sense to just invest in a ssd upgrade for it and see if that solves the issue, since it seems to be solely the hard drive that is failing. If that works I'll probably skip the repair time/costs. Haven't had a good experience with this computer. Out of the gate if you just buy a ssd that might be a better experience for you.

I decided I wanted to get a second opinion and took it to a local computer shop who told me that the hard drive was bad.

It was having issues as in when I tried to maximize the scene with Netflix it would just shrink to a 3x5"" screen volume, also the screen had been replaced before I bought it and is not well attached, very disappointed, I bought this last summer, but only started to use it in October when I was traveling, so I spent close to $700 for a Mac that lasted 2 months, return and replacement window has ""closed"" so I am stuck with a hefty repair bill.",73426,3804,3805,2,I have been struggling with this product since day one. I am not getting responses from the seller OR the extended warranty repair company.I have never had trouble with Amazon before. Every issue I have ever had has been settled with ease and courtesy.This has not. Made more devastating as it it is the largest purchase I have had and the product has been unusable almost since day one. We sent it to the extended warranty place who said they fixed it but it still doesnÂ’t work.We have spent hours at Apple doing diagnostics and it is simply not functional. To repair it would cost more than I paid. They do not think that the parts it was refurbished with are even Apple parts.This was a terrible product and not worth the money.,73427,3805,3806,0,"I originally purchased this at the beginning of April after about a week it stopped charging (would receive ""low power charger"" connected message and not charge). Tried the troubleshooting steps...hard reset (refresh+power), left it plugged in, left it unplugged, etc, but couldn't get it to charge. Tried the charger with other devices and it worked fine. I ended up returning it. I decided to try for another one, which I received towards the end of April. After about a week, ran into the same exact issue, and tried the same exact remedies as above (that have been recommended on here and elsewhere). Still wouldn't charge. And now this one is being returned. After reading through the comments I see that this issue is occurring for a lot of other people as well. Is this a known defect that ASUS refuses to acknowledge? I know that they have been replying to comments on here to send it in for repair but that almost seems like they knew this was going to be an issue and prepared themselves to receive numerous units to repair. Thankfully for both of these purchases I was still within the return period and was able to send back to Amazon (considering in both cases they stopped charging quickly). But that doesn't leave me with much confidence in ASUS and a highly rated Chromebook that was supposed to be ""one of the best"", especially when I found myself with the same issue on the same model...twice.",73428,3806,3807,1,"I purchased the C302A from Amazon last summer. When it worked correctly it's a great machine. I think the Chrome OS is plenty powerful and versatile enough for the vast majority of users, perhaps as much as 95 percent. I am a writer-researcher and there was nothing that I did on my old Windows machines that I couldn't do on the C302a. The hardware which would be middling at best on a Windows laptop was very fast on a Chromebook.Then in February, I began to have persistent audio problems that required me to shut down and restart the C302a multiple times a day. I contact ASUS and they issued an RMA and I sent the machine to ASUS for repair. I got it back about 2 weeks later and within an hour the problem began all over again. I contacted ASUS, got another RMA, sent it back and got it back yet another two weeks later. Nothing had changed.This time, the ASUS rep told me to send it back for exchange. That's when the fun started. I did as requested and heard nothing from ASUS. Previously, they had sent me emails acknowledging their receipt of the machine. This time, crickets. I checked FedEx which confirmed that ASUS had received the package. When I called I was told that they were awaiting my response to an email giving a choice between several possible replacements. No such email had been sent, much less received. I finally got to speak to a supervisor who called me the next day who confirmed that no such email had been sent and that what was actually happening was that they were waiting for a suitable replacement to be available -- someone else's problem child -- so that they could recondition it and send it to me.Now, I wasn't crazy about getting someone else's problem but that's all that was on offer. Yet ASUS screwed this up, too. They never got back to me and when I called we were back to the ""we're awaiting your response to our email"" version of events. What's more, when I called their support number again, I got a message saying that they were closed and to call back during regular business hours. At 12:30 p.m. EDT.Yet another supervisor -- I got through by calling sales and insisting on being transferred to support -- on the ""escalation team"" repeated the ""we're awaiting a used C302a we can foist on you"" (albeit not in those exact words) along with a promise that yet another supervisor would call me the next day which she did. And these were the exact words I was told ""[Your replacement] is currently in the process of being shipped with a replacement unit of the same model. Once the replacement unit has been reserved for your RMA, the replacement will be shipped to the address below.""""In the process"" could mean ""forging the aluminum needed to make the case which will then be assembled into and sold to someone else and then returned.""As of today, I have no idea of when or even whether I will receive a replacement from ASUS, much less whether that replacement will be any good. I'm out nearly $500 with little recourse against ASUS.Avoid ASUS like the plague. They do not stand behind their products.Update:it has been several weeks since I posted this review and nothing has changed. Actually, that's not true. Asus has managed to add insult to injury. Twice. I called Asus to inquire as to the status yet again. Yet again, I was transferred to a supervisor who promised to ""escalate"" the matter despite my protests that this matter had been elevated so many times that it was halfway to the moon by now. It was all he could do. That and a promise that someone would contact me within 24-48 hours, Needless to say at this point, that didn't happen.The second insult was here at Amazon. After my initial post, someone from Asus ""customer loyalty"" added a comment insisting that this experience was atypical and violative of the company's standards and asked me to contact him or her so that they could help. I sent an email with the details. As if to prove my point, I haven't heard back from them.It's almost as if they are trolling their customers.Update 2I finally got my computer back. After I posted the previous update, the ASUS representative emailed me and reiterated that he/she had contacted ASUS and told them to make my case a priority. Given my previous experience, I was skeptical. But a few days later I received an email from FedEx telling me that a package from ASUS was on its way.The replacement came in a box that gave no indication whether it was new or refurbished. In any case, it looks like new and works very well.So, does this change my rating? As I said earlier, if you like Chrome OS, and I do, this is a great laptop. It's fast and has a great screen and keyboard. It's not as loaded as the Pixelbook or even the top-of-the-line Samsung, but it cost less than half as much as the former and hundreds less than the latter. Its build quality is easily comparable to both.So the machine itself is a 5-star laptop.Unfortunately, my customer service experience was abysmal. It was only ""resolved"" because I made a nuisance of myself by posting here on Amazon. I believe that if I hadn't taken a step that I find personally distasteful, ASUS wouldn't have responded. If it were possible to assign a sub-zero-star rating for customer service, I would.So, should you get it? Only if you know that there's a chance of an experience like mine and that of several other raters. Perhaps buyng a used or already furbished one with a Square Trade warranty is the best way to go.",73429,3807,3808,1,"I was SO excited to buy the ASUS Chromebook, as I have had 2 other Samsung Chromebooks, and bought some for my grandchildren. But this Asus, who offered SO much & rated over 4 stars, turned to a black screen, just over a month after I received it. Lo and behold, I hadn't read quite ALL of the 1* reviews: the worst was a teacher who had ordered so many for her several classes and said "" I think the problem is with the motherboard. If you hold it just right, and don't move it, it works fine."" She's trying to figure out what to do. That made my decision to return it & NOT replace it. Too many have tried to fix it, only to not get it back months later, and then have it break AGAIN, when it was no longer under warranty. Thank you helping me though this Amazon. Asus, has a horrible reputation. Read ALL the reviews~.",73430,3808,3809,2,"I purchased this notebook back in July and was initially happy with my purchase. However, after a couple of months the keyboard case started to crack at the corner. I contacted customer service and was told to send the notebook to the repair center where it would be repaired under Warranty. 2 weeks later I received an email informing me the crack was not covered under warranty, and I would need to pay $183. After numerous calls, I then received confirmation the warranty was valid, but only as a Â‘one-offÂ’. 2 more weeks go by, and the repair status still shows as Â‘in repairÂ’. I called customer service again and was told the issue would be escalated. Another week goes by and still no change. I call again and was told the issue would be escalated again. I asked for the notebook just to be returned as is, and was told thatÂ’s not possible as itÂ’s Â‘in repairÂ’. In summary, I have been without this device for over a month, have no idea if and when it will be returned, and in what condition.Day 29 since Asus received my notebook. Still no update, status, supervisor escalation. Â‘Bot response to review requested RMA # which was provided same day, but no follow up.Day 33 - Got same email / escalation from customer service but still no ETA, status, evidence of escalation or Notebook!Day 42 - Finally received repaired Notebook.Update - 7/30/18 - Exactly the same issue has occurred with a crack in the keyboard cover on the opposite side. This Chromebook has not been dropped or treated roughly so I can only assume this is a design or manufacturing defect. I have been informed by Asus Customer Service that I would need to return the device (again), and the repair would cost an estimated $210!!!This device would be a good choice if it weren't so poorly constructed. Now looking elsewhere for a reliable Chromebook.",73431,3809,3810,0,"Great machine out of the box... BUT after only a couple of days the thing just turned off and won't turn back on again... I tired every remedy found online, and even got in touch with Asus tech support who just said ""send it back""... This seems to be a somewhat common issue with Chromebooks but this Asus model doesn't have a way to preform an external reset, which is a big problem if you've setup any personal info on it and it has to be sent back. AND apparently Amazon is experiencing a supply shortage because my replacement isn't expected until sometime between Jan 11th to Feb 5th! I purchased this for a Christmas gift (bought on Nov 28th and received Dec 7th) and so next month, or maybe even the next is totally unacceptable... Everything (covers, etc...) is going back in efforts to find something that works before Christmas... I don't usually leave bad reviews and I totally get supply issues, but after searching online, I found that these things seem to have tendencies towards intermittent power issues (battery not charging, etc.. and this one in particular has no way to reset...) I wish I would have known that BEFORE buying...",73432,3810,3811,2,"Upon receiving my Azpen Innovations A746 tablet to test (which by the way arrived VERY quickly), I noticed that it resembled the Kindle Fire that I bought my wife a few years ago. I was surprised to find out that the battery was already charged, and came with a wall plug, a laptop charging cable, and another cable that I assume also charges the tablet with a different connector. On the flip side, the screen protector that came with its first label did not come completely off, so I could not use it.Now, I am an iOS guy and not much of an Android fan, so I knew that the operating system would have a learning curve for me. It did not take me as long to learn how the OS worked as I thought it would, but there was a moment where I had to do some poking and prodding to undo a folder that I mistakenly created. The tablet also did not adjust to the proper time zone once I got it up and running, and I had to do the digging to find out how to fix it. I was able to get the Wi-Fi connected very easily so I could really start to get my hands dirty.Once I was able to log in with my Google credentials, I started downloading apps and found it easy and quick to get them going, including a podcast app that made it easy to find the podcasts that I like to listen to. The interface can tend to drag a bit when I get into the apps, but I have seen worse.The 7Â” screen works very well, sizing the icons in a fashion that doesnÂ’t make me squint to find all of my icons. I did find it a bit frustrating in selecting certain places on the screen that were unresponsive and required me to have almost pinpoint accuracy to get where I wanted to go. Also, the Â“On/OffÂ” switches are not as responsive as I would like them to be. There were times on unboxing where I had to back out and go back into a screen to get the switch to work.I logged into my Facebook account and began to browse. The icons were a bit small in this case and they were tough to click where I needed them to. During my browsing, I got a private message from a friend of mine, and replying to him on the on-screen keyboard got a bit bulky in both landscape and portrait modes. Perhaps this will be easier to work with when connected to a Bluetooth keyboard.The touch screen is a bit slow in response as I scroll through apps, but the quality of pictures seems to be pretty good. I am impressed with the resistance of the screen to keep my fingerprints at a minimum. Video play is a bit grainy and pixelated, which is surprising for a screen as small as this, and the speaker that is built in is not as loud as it should be.I do like the fact that I can add to its storage capacity and plan on doing so in the near future so that I can work with the music features and find out how that works.The real test here lies in the opinions of my wife. She tends to be a bit picky when it comes to technology, even though she tends to just do social media and the games therein. She was really wowed at first as she checked out some of the features, but that faded as she loaded her Dragon Vale game only to find out that it would not get past the splash page, even after she deleted and reloaded the app. She also felt the video quality was a bit grainy and slow.Overall, this would be a great tablet for kids to play with, but I am not sure that I would use it as an everyday piece of equipment. I plan on using it as a remote with a new home theater system I am designing very soon and feel like it will truly serve its purpose there.",73433,3811,3812,0,"This tablet seemed to work fine for the first two or three days but we have had it only a week and it will not turn on! It gets to the azpen screen and just stays there. We have restarted it, let the battery run out and still nothing. We got this for my son to play games on and it only had two games on it, so I can't say that it was being worked very hard. If there is another way to get it to restart please let me know,other wise I am now in the market for another tablet. Again. Really not happy.",73434,3813,3814,0,"I was prepared for this to be a low performance device, and I was okay with that. However, I was not prepared for the touch screen to be so poorly mapped that it was impossible to type the number 3. I could get 2 and 4 all day long, but no 3, and no work-around that I could think of would fix it.Since there's a 3 in my wifi password, this tablet's time in my life was short. I put it right back in its box and started the return. The Fire with ads is absolutely worth the few bucks more.",73435,3814,3815,2,"I just requested a return lable for this tablet. I was very disappointed, especially after reading the reviews, expected a better quality tablet. Maybe I am spoiled by my first generation Kindle Fire, but this tablet was so frustration. It took forever for stuff to load, and the wifi fell out constantly. Never had this problem with the Kindle Fire, laptop,nor smartphone. Over and over again, I would have to reconnect to wifi. the screen, as notated in several comments was very washed out. I tried to log into the blio e-reader account several times, but was told it was either down, or moved, so much for e-books.",73436,3815,3816,0,"I fully expected to give this tablet a good review but that definitely is not going to happen.While the Hi9 apparently does have a maximum 10 core processor it is normally just utilizing 1 or 2 of those cores so the UI is way less smooth than it should be--it's actually significantly less smooth than the far less powerful Fire 10 Tablet. The Hi9 does play every game that I have tried fine but it makes no sense to leave almost all of the processing power dormant when you are scrolling in an app or surfing the internet or doing other mundane tasks. Cores are useless if the device isn't taking advantage of them.The display is bright and colorful but it feels like there is virtually no oleophobic coating--the glass isn't as slick to the touch as it should be and attracts fingerprints and smudges like crazy that are way more difficult to wipe off with a soft cloth than they should be. But the Hi9 is pretty inexpensive and that's the most obvious area where corners were cut. Otherwise, the build quality seems pretty solid for the price.The Chuwi Hi9 comes with Google Play and seems at first to be running a very clean version of Android. The only odd thing I initially noticed was that the standard Settings/System/System Update menu doesn't actually update the OS. When I turned on my Hi9 it was running old software and System Update showed no updates available. But if you click About Tablet instead of System Update there is a selection called Wireless Update that actually does update the OS.The tablet updated the OS twice (which includes rebooting to do the actual install) before I installed any of my own apps. When it showed a third update something didn't seem right because the package date was older than the date for the second OTA and Android doesn't update backward.It turned out there was something very wrong with the third OTA update--it installed com.adups.fota and com.adups.fota.sysoper which is a notorious malicious app that can not only spy on anything you do with your Android device and send the information to servers in China but can also install any app that it wants without your knowledge or control. Since it installs as part of an official OTA the malware has elevated system rights, is virtually impossible for the user to uninstall unless the device is rooted and doesn't show up in Malwarebytes or Google Play Protect as being malicious--although the Malwarebytes website explains that the app is definitely considered malicious and offers possible ways to disable or temporarily uninstall it.Com.adups.fota also hijacked the legitimate Wireless Update app making it impossible to update the Hi9 OS through normal means.Keep in mind that all of this happened before I installed a single app of my own on the tablet.After several hours of research, I found out how to flash a clean stock system image which did get rid of the malware--but unless I root the tablet and install a different OS there is no way for me to prevent the malware from being installed again.To give this review further perspective, I should mention that I currently own two Huawei smartphones (P20 Pro and Mate 20 Pro) and one Xiaomi smartphone (Mix 2S) so I am not a Trump nutjob who is paranoid about using Chinese electronics. This specific malware only shows up on budget Chinese smartphones (like those from Blu)--and apparently, budget Chinese tablets.I'm not sure if I am going to keep this tablet or return it but I am certain that I couldn't recommend buying a Chuwi Hi9 unless you are familiar with rooting and flashing on Android devices and know what you are possibly getting into. I didn't purchase my tablet from a third party seller either--I ordered it directly from Amazon and the seller was supposed to be Chuwi, the actual company that makes the tablet.Update: Chuwi released a new ROM build on 11/22/18 that some people say has not reinstalled com.adups.fota onto their tablets. The new build also improves CPU management slightly--my tablet is now using 2-3 cores for basic tasks instead of just 1-2 but in terms of overall UI smoothness there is still a lot of room for improvement. The bigger problem is that com.adups.fota blocks the Hi9 from being able to see any OTA updates so Hi9 owners without technical knowledge will not be able to update their tablets.",73437,3816,3817,1,"Overall, the tablet is decent, but they chose to use a cheap USB port, which becomes loose very quickly and will require you hold the cable in just the right position to charge it. After a few months, you will have to hold it by hand to charge it.If CHUWI responded to emails and honored their warranty, this would have been a decent purchase, but they don't and I bought this to take on a trip that meant I got home after the return window was closed. I have emailed and used their web form to no avail, and will likely have to solder on a new port on my own. Unless you, too are an engineer, don't buy this company's products!",73438,3817,3818,0,"This seemed like a very nice affordable tablet, which is why I bought it, but after about a week of use it started to randomly shut off and reboot. - Not fun anymore for my son who had to put up with it! Besides that, I discovered it wants you to click on ""wireless update"" a couple of times which upgrades the Android security patch to June, 2018 (a good thing), but it also adds some ""fota....."" software (which is unremovable). After researching this, I found that the US banned cell phones being sold here with this software, saying it was a type of spyware into customer usage data....etc. I did a factory reboot (which actually keeps the June security update), but removed the ""fota"" software. Couldn't figure out how to stop the frequent reboots, though. Response from Chuwi was to perform some sort of flash. From my point of view, this is a brand new tablet that shouldn't need a flash - it should work flawlessly for quite a bit of time. So I returned it to Amazon and bought a better known tablet - it was more money, but better peace of mind.",73439,3818,3819,0,"No screen access and locked up after I loaded a couple of games, couldn't get my information off so I wrote the company, here is what I got back;""1)do not play the Large-scale game when you use the laptop,that will give the motherboard too much stress2)Don't open several apps at the same time,It had better not use when the laptop get charge3) If you wear a casing for your tablet ,we suggest that you take off itthe fashionable tablet cases are insulating the back of the device,also due to overheating""Had to run the battery out over a couple of days, then it started OK and I reset it and sent it back!",73440,3819,3820,1,"This tablet looks and runs great... if but for a few problems this thing would be awesome. Unfortunately I could not recommend this tablet at all.The BAD:First it wants to constantly update and install malware. Honestly this is minor for me and can be managed but lets be honest, it shouldn't happen.Second it constantly reboots and changes mac address. This is very annoying because I have to keep adding the new mac address everyday to my account on my network!!! This is a real pain in the arse! Everything on my network has certain privileges so I can monitor and keep kids safe. Because this thing changes mac address it appears to be a new device. This is a nightmare and a major deal breaker!The last issue I take with this tablet is the very cheap piece of garbage charging port that everyone (I guess I should say every ""REAL"" reviewer) has issue with. The port immediately became loose and doesn't work unless you hold it just right... I have figured a way to stand it up against a wall so it charges which keeps me from having to hold it...The GOOD:Yes there is a lot of good with the tablet but it is sooooooo overshadowed! The picture is beautiful, the power and speed is great and everything runs well.I would have paid double if the port wasn't garbage and the damn thing didn't change MAC address multiple times per day... Honestly the updates and malware is manageable but those other hardware issues are unacceptable! I honestly do not not take the time to review products unless it is very good or very poor... I so wanted to give this 5 stars but would give it less than 1 if i could.

We attempted to troubleshoot the issues ourselves and even upgraded to an additional 8GB RAM, but then contacted tech support. The first tech sent a few troubleshooting links to test the RAM, reinstall Windows 10 (which had to be downloaded to a flash drive-make sure you have one), and finally a more advanced task to disassemble the lodging for the graphics card and test it with a spare. The first tech was fairly unresponsive after we tried the first two, promised to register our account, and then we didn't hear from him for several days. We had to go to the online support via chat and found another, more savvy tech. He registered us and ended up getting an RMA for us. However, we had to spend $100 to ship and insure the CPU back to Cyber Power. We thought it was a good deal for the money, but this is a new machine and should work out of the box. If not, Cyber Power should have a local tech contract where we could have taken the CPU to be checked out for no cost.

And the third comprising my experiences of both after the unit failed within the warranty period, and the vendor's attempts to avoid honoring their supposed warranty.-----TL,DR: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR. With a very low effort refurb process there appears to be a higher than average number of purchased units quickly failing, and the vendor fails to honor the warranty by providing false or misleading correspondence to warranty inquiries.-----1.) I admit I wasn't expecting much as far as the Chromebook itself. I was specifically looking for a decent, stable, used/refurb older Chromebook, modestly priced unit to use for testing, debugging, and experimentation in an educational environment. It is not my primary machine, so I didn't need it to be super snappy. This model is particularity geared towards the school/student market, so I figured it would be reliably sturdy. I was pleased to find that this unit was extremely clean, well functioning, and very speedy and responsive even beyond my basic needs. The only drawback of using an older refurb unit is battery performance. This one doesn't last very long, or hold a charge well. But I'm pretty proficient with this tech, and already knew that this battery design is only optimally rated for an approximate 18 month window, after which a steady decline in battery performance should be expected. It's just part of the territory. Replacing these batteries is not very complicated. Anyone considering a refurbished model that has more than a couple of years under it should consider doing the same. This unit (true to the model line in general) has sturdy, solid feel, a responsive and snappy keyboard, a clear bright screen, and nice audio.2.) As far as the vendor, I initially could not have been more satisfied. Not only was the price lower than I expected to have to pay for a modest refurb unit, but shipping was almost immediate, and FAST! I expected a 2-day shipment via Amazon Prime, but my delivery arrived less than 23 hours after placing the order. I don't live in an area where faster than 2-day service is typically an option, so this was an especially great surprise.--------HOWEVER.......3.) After less than two months of very sparse and careful use (a combined use of under 3 hours) the unit simply died, no longer booting up.After ensuring the battery was fully charged I applied the 3-key reset method (esc-refresh-pwr) and the screen flickered the ""Chrome OS is missing...."" message before pixelating into random lines and colors, quickly seizing up. Repeated attempts produced the same results.Being proficient with this tech (I am a Chromebook administrator on a school site) it was quickly evident the unit was suffering logic board failure. Presuming that any tech support will still want to go through all the paces, I still proceeded with an attempt to freshly install Chrome OS, but it continued to freeze, flicker and pixelate upon any attempt to boot up. A call into Amazon's tech support to isolate symptoms confirmed my diagnosis of logic board failure. This is despite having very light use of this unit for less than a total of 3 hours since purchase. I was not worried as the unit has died well within the vendor's 90-day warranty, and after having been so thoroughly surprised by their very speedy purchase fulfillment, I fully expected them to honor that warranty. However the several communications I have had with this vendor have produced confusing responses with no indication thus far that they will honor the warranty and replace the unit or refund the purchase.I initially notified the vendor regarding the failure of the unit, and hoped to elicit information about their warranty coverage. I also attached the transcript of the chat with Amazon's tech support identifying logic board failure. Their response was the following:""Your message has been assigned to me, and I am reviewing it as a high priority. I will follow up with you very soon. Blazing Prices is committed to your satisfaction, and I will make every effort to resolve your concern as quickly as possible. Thanks for choosing Blazing Prices!""Have a great day!Thank you,Blazing Prizes""That is all good and well, but I took note that their response did not include an actual service representative's name to correspond with the noted ""me"" in their response. An actual contact person is usually identified in context of following a ticket through a tech support chain. This was an early indicator of a pat automated response.Two days later I received a followup email that appeared similarly automated, but with the additional note that I should contact the manufacturer for warranty assistance, stating that the manufacturer has been notified of my query and that they stand ready to assist me.Now, at this point I knew that the response was laughably suspect. Not only did they not provide any identifying contact information about whom (or how) to contact ""the manufacturer"", but I knew for a fact that this manufacturer (Dell in this case) was absolutely not poised to offer warranty assistance for a 3+ year old 2nd-hand low-end Chromebook. In short, Blazing Prices outright lied.I responded to their email about ""the manufacturer"" to see what they would say if I I asked for more information about following up with the manufacturer. I received the above-mentioned automated reply.I knew by then that I would get nowhere with the vendor. Still, I have continued to follow up with additional queries in the weeks following. As I post this I still have a few days left within the 90-day warranty period. But each response from the vendor has likewise mirrored the previously noted automated response.They are not necessarily a scammer. They sold me a product at what on the surface should have been a very competitive price. If it continued to function at least beyond the warranty period the vendor would have met their obligation decently. However it is clear by my experience, as well as those of other reviewers, that this vendor has falsified some of the claims on the product page. They certainly are not able to account for the integrity of the product - and in such cases that is what gives a supposed 90-day warranty its value - but this vendor also has shown no indication that they will honor that warranty - so having added it to the product listing constitutes fraud.I already have a tech support ticket in to Amazon regarding this purchase, and am following up with them regarding Blazing Prices fraudulence in skirting their warranty obligation.Do not purchase from this vendor.",73450,3829,3830,1,"Buyer beware.Computer arrived and worked while plugged in to wall charger. the Computer never took a charge.Seller doesn't offer prepaid returns for a defective DOA computer.

Videos are almost impossible as I can only see half of it.I have several complaints about this tablet. When logging in I have to restart it to log in because it says my pin is wrong. After restarting, so far, it will take my pin. Sometimes when I try to touch things to open them they either won't open or the tablet lags. I'm not sure which one yet. Other times everything loads fast. I will have to update this when I figure it out. When I open Facebook the page is huge. I can't see the full pic or videos. I've checked settings and they are ok. Sites like Amazon and my email are normal size. I really had to look for the mini scan disc slot. You have to remove little panel and it's so fragile I was afraid I would break it.

The software forced us to reset the tablet numerous times and the screen cracked from routine usage. Once the screen cracked, the touch screen became non-functional. We currently have an android from another manufacturer that was dropped and it still works. This K-10 has poor design and poor routine handling testing. I would recommend against buying it. Stick with manufacturers you know. Also, 2 faced support is very irritating.",73454,3834,3835,0,I have to admit that I am severely disappointed in this tablet. At first I really loved it but after only 1 Day I regretted making this purchase because the tablet might as well be a $100 paper weight because the touch screen doesn't work in the middle of the screen. I like to play games like toon blast and they require the use of the middle of the screen but this tablet is defective in the middle. If I need to scroll down I have to constantly rotate the screen and half of the time that doesn't work either. I have been trying to find a way to fix the issue for the last few weeks and there is no solution. Unfortunately I am currently not at home which is where the tablet is and by the time that I can return it It will be too late as I won't be home for the next 4 weeks so the company won't accept the return so I pretty much paid for a defective product!!!!!!,73455,3835,3836,0,Product was purchased for myself and i got this one bcus it came with a 1 year subscription for 360 personal Microsoft & & exactly 31 days my network adaptor was fried (you NEED this to connect to internet...

When it was sent back Amazon blamed HP & HP blamed Amazon & no one wants to pay for my 1 year product key because when you purchase and open your computer the computer bypasses the code because its internal and you cant do a back up on a drive because the computer was inoperable once I followed prompts ordered by HP Tech Support which was to identify the problems with the laptop.

The small Hard drive is not big enough for the large bi-annual Windows updates.I called and spoke to three different people at HP Support and all three refused to help me and told me it was a windows problem. I eventually called Windows support who did help but the only way to update them is to download the full update and save it on a bootable USB drive, but again, this Stream computer does not have enough hard drive space to do that. So the only solution is to throw this away and buy another one every year to stay up to date.Spend a little more and buy a real computer and avoid all the headaches with this deceptive laptop.Shame on HP for selling this to unsuspecting customers.",73457,3837,3838,1,"CouldnÂ’t even get this to run. Correction, it ran through the set up but I wasnÂ’t able to use the Internet. I could search on google but couldnÂ’t access any websites. Possibly because of windows 10. Not sure.

Sending product back and will not buy again. VERY DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER.To be fair, all other features of the laptop are great and as advertised. If you can deal with throwing down a large chunk of cash on this machine and getting a faulty trackpad out of the box then go right ahead. I've done lots of research and it looks as though an alarmingly high percentage of laptops come with the trackpads that rattle. The best fix includes taking the back off and sticking a piece of paper to the back of the trackpad.Good luck.",73461,3841,3842,1,"I bought this computer so that I would have something which did not act wonky while traveling on business in China.What I received was a laptop that essentially cannot be used in China. Works OK in the US, with the exception of prohibiting me from accessing GOOGLE MAPS, but in China - nothing. The internet and the wi fi is totally disabled while in China. I have had someone look at the machine while in China and upon returning to the US. Neither had any idea what was the issue. I am well aware of what is and what is not censored but that was not the issue. When I asked customer service they had no suggestions other than to clear off all my programs send them the machine for 2 weeks, and hope for the best.That means being without the laptop for an extended period, not to mention the inconvenience of having to remove and then re-install every one of my programs.Why it will not allow me to use Google maps is a great mystery. Other map programs - no problem, but google maps loads for 1 second and then is blacked out. Not when I am in China mind you (that is censored) but while I'm in the US. There has been a lot written and speculated about Huawei and their motivations for entering the US market. Some have accused the company as being a trojan horse on behalf of the Peoples Party. I thought that was absurd, but after my experience - I'm not sure.

It earned top reveiws in IT press that praises its build quality, screen and other features. Unfortunately it suffers from drawbacks that completely overweight itÂ’s strengths. These to me are:1. Poor quality control: It is a first laptop I ever owned that malfunctioned so quickly2. Weak warranty support: I am spending hours truing to figure out with Huawei team how to fix the problem. I already reset the system twice, updated drivers, run all possible types of maintenance, nothing works. With my Surface or MacBook I would have been offered replacement or repair a while ago.I am not giving up on my Matebook yet, but the experience owning it was so far disappointing....UPDATE: it is December and Huawei is completely failing to provide any meaningful support to have it fixed.

Booted up immediately from SSD. Honestly no issues with the functionality of the computer. The only issue that I had was that I heard a high pitched whining noise coming from inside the case, it was so loud and distracting that I could not enjoy my time in front of the computer. I discovered it to be the LED strips that are hardwired in with the case. After reading some reviews and other various posts I came to find out that this is a somewhat common issue with this case. I changed the lighting settings and the noise lessened but did not fully go away unless I turned the LEDs completely off.

It loaded fast, sounded good and was great for gaming. On the other hand, even while it was working, I was really surprised that it had so few USB slots, no CD drive, no memory card slots and it couldn't handle a VGA monitor connection. It's sort of like advertising a fast car, you buy it and then it's like, ""Oh, but there are no wheels on it."" For the price, I don't feel like you should have to work around the unadvertised lack of features that come standard with pretty much every other computer. For that reason alone, it was disappointment.However, the problems with this go much deeper. Two of the USB slots weren't working. I realized that was because they weren't plugged in on this inside. Sloppy, but I fixed it. I have not been able to fix the never ending blue screen of death that started yesterday or the broken remote that came with it. I wasn't very happy with it because of the lack of standard features BEFORE it locked up and became unworkable. At this point, I am just hoping to return it and get something else.

Fingerprint scanner on the side power button works surprisingly well. Screen is high-quality and works great for e-reading, watching video content, and games.BUT--the device has a fatal flaw--it does not work reliably with micro SD cards AT ALL. I tried multiple, brand new cards, and the tablet was not able to format and use any of them reliably. Some would work the first time, but quickly get corrupted and become unusable. Others, the tablet couldn't recognize them at all from the start.When you've got a device with only 16 GB of onboard storage, roughly 10 GB of which is taken up by the OS, leaving you with 6 GB of space, this just isn't workable. Without being able to expand your storage with an SD card, you end up with no room for apps, movies, games, etc.Hopefully Lenovo can fix this at some point, but it seems from other reviews that this is a really common problem. It's a shame, because otherwise it'd be one of the few mid-range tablets on the market to truly be worth the money.",73468,3854,3855,2,"First, the good: I was initially really happy with this purchase--the tablet worked great until it quit. It synced up with my Google Play account and downloaded all the Android apps that I had on my phone (at least the ones that were supported--which is most). I purchased it to use as a laptop-light. I recently switched my phone service to Google Fi, and this tablet took a Google Fi SIM card, so I could get internet anywhere, even where WiFi wasn't available. Using it over the 3G/4G network also gets around the problem of unsecured WiFi in some places. So I was initially thrilled. Then came the bad...Just over a month after I purchased this device, it started rebooting every couple minutes. Since it was past 30 days, I was unable to return it to Amazon. I sent it to warranty service with Lenovo. It has now been a month and they still claim to be waiting on parts. I have made multiple phone calls to the warranty group, and I am being told that because they don't have the parts available, they are not obligated to honor the nine-business-day warranty repair turnaround. And they are unwilling to send me a new device without ""escalating"" the ticket. I've requested the escalation, but am now told that that will take almost another week before I'm contacted regarding the escalation (at which point they may or may not agree to replace it).If a company sells a defective device, and doesn't have the parts to repair it, the device should be replaced immediately, no questions asked. To tell me there's nothing they can do because they didn't stock the parts is ridiculous. For a device that has a useful life of about two years, a month-and-a-half turnaround on the warranty service is not acceptable. I bought the device because I needed it for work. I don't expect instantaneous turnaround on the warranty repair, but I do expect that if they sell me a defective device, that they remedy the problem quickly.This would have been a 5-star review if Lenovo had come through on the warranty service. But now I would recommend finding a different brand that will honor their warranty if something goes wrong (because some number of any products will have something go wrong).

I mailed it to Microsoft complete in box with all the accessories, which was a mistake as they returned the accessories to me without the box or included paperwork. The replacement Surface Pro I received was in even worse condition then the one I sent in. The metal frame was literally bent. The packaging was not damaged so it was sent out to me in that condition by the warehouse. The nice little note they packaged in with it saying they tested each replacement extensively and checked them all before sending them out was obviously untruthful.

The power surge/ac adaptor blew up the capacitor and possibly fried my laptop. CPU and RAM were running low.

Either I just had bad luck or I was thinking maybe that I drew too much power from all the usb ports to power and connect my Logitech G13, Laptop Cooling Pad, and Logitech PowerPlay Pad with G903 Mouse.Got my replacement recently and I haven't had any major issues so far. I did have to plug my laptop into its AC Adapter to turn it on the first time which was weird because the battery was already at full charge. I'm still worried about the quality of capacitor and conductor inside this thing. I just hope it doesn't go pop and start burning again.Overall, it is a great laptop for the price. I would recommend updating the RAM from 8gb to at least 16gb. The CPU runs super fast and doesn't start utilizing its full potential until you start doing things like installation of applications, but the Memory Usage sits around 40-50% the most of the time. I can notice some slow downs when opening Windows Explorer any some of my apps when I have other programs up.I like the addition of the cooler boost button, but most of the time I don't have to use it because I have a ThermalTake Auto Laptop Cooling Pad that monitors the bottom surface of my laptop. If I don't have my ThermalTake fan on the laptop can get as hot as 93-97 degrees Fahrenheit while sitting idle or playing games. My fan can get it as low as 82-83 degrees, consistently, while idle or gaming. Booting it up from a restart or shutdown is about as fast as an SSD.Trackpad is OK. The SteelSteries Keyboard feels great and looks awesome, but the keyboard surface of the laptop can get warm while sitting idle or gaming even when I have a fan pushing cold air underneath the laptop. There are air intakes/air vents that take in air on the bottom of the laptop. So I suggest getting a mesh aluminum or metal stand/cooling pad with your purchase.The monitor is bright and colorful. I don't see any problems with it. 1920x1080 is fine when gaming.Wireless card is finicky with both units I had. My laptop seems to lose its internet connection at random times. It is a bit frustrating.Some bloatware, but not as bad as it was 10 years ago;. Most of the bloatware seems to be from Microsoft itself after the laptop installs the updates. Uninstall Minecraft, Candy Crush, the preloaded Microsoft games, and the two Norton Internet Security applications then you're fine. Keeping the MSI software is optional, a few of these are useful like BurnRecovery to make a backup of your version of Windows just in case anything happens.I'll update and give more stars after I've had this laptop for a month without any issues.Update(09/02/2018): After using this laptop for for almost a week now the headphone 3.5mm jack is now only outputting audio to the left side of my headphones only. I checked the balance settings for both sides on the windows volume mixer menu and theyÂ’re both set to default. I used three different headphones and I still had the same issue. I updated the RealTek Audio drivers and tested it using Razer SurroundÂ’s audio drivers; It still did not fix it. So now this leads me to believe it is a hardware issue.IÂ’m taking one star off because every it is very frustrating to spend my time to install and update everything on this laptop to only have a hardware component fail shortly after. IÂ’m returning this and purchasing something else from a different manufacturer.",73477,3865,3866,2,"The first thing I noticed after opening the box was that my computer was not wrapped in bubble wrap. Only a little bit of paper. I could feel it shifting as I carried it into my home. When I got it open, Immediately saw the dirty looking condition. I had to get a damp cloth to wipe off the outside due to the fact my hands got dirty just taking it out of the box. Afterward, I could see what appeared to be clear nail polish or glue around and on the mousepad. I managed to get it off with a tile cleaner. Although it seems to be working fairly well, I cannot express my distaste in the condition it was delivered. That is why I am SUSPENDING my Amazon Prime. A review of the company that supplied this needs to be done!",73478,3866,3867,1,"I just bought this computer for my daughter for her birthday. The computer arrived and I never opened the package and wrapped it the night before her birthday. I work first shift so she was allowed to open one present when she woke up. I got home from school so she could open all her presents. The look on her face when she opened the computer was priceless the joy on her face was just amazing. My daughter is a cheerleader and had to cheer on her birthday, with that being said I stayed home an showered since I just got home from work. She did power the computer up before she left so I got on YouTube and instantly noticed a line across the screen so I emailed Amazon. I received a message stating a refund so I was going to take a picture of the screen to show them what I was talking about and went to the computer and it wouldn't even turn on.

Because why? It's a chromebook that why, unless your life revolve around Google and their apps then don't get a chromebook. You can't download any type of software on it not Microsoft word, iTunes, a lot of the basic things that's we use on a pc you cannot get on a chromebook.I am a only student and I can barely do my school work on this thing.

We have had problems with it since day 1. We have had this since September 2015 (I am reviewing this in January 2016) because I am absolutely fed up with the constant annoyances from this tablet. Instead of writing a lengthy summary, I decided to list pros and cons, and explain in detail the more important ones.Pros-- The preloaded games are really great (when they work). My 5 year old loves them, and there are plenty of options for him so he never gets bored.- There are also quite a bit of educational games that are a nice feature. He enjoys the math game the most because it has the ""fun"" of a regular game but also the challenge of math equations.- The ""pen"" that comes with the tablet is a nice feature, especially for the drawing app.- The case that comes with it is not only very sturdy but also the rubberized edging seems to help with gripping. He never has to worry about his hands getting to sweaty and accidentally dropping it.Cons:- The battery life is HORRIBLE. We charge it every night. He plays with it in the morning car ride on the way to school which is about a 10 minute drive. If he does not turn it off completely, it will be dead by the time I pick him back up at 2:30. When he does remember to turn it off, he will then play after homework, for about 30 minutes and without fail. every night the battery is almost completely dead. It never lasts more than 24 hours, and considering I only let him play MAYBE an hour a day, in separate time increments, that is absolutely ridiculous. I was really thinking this would be great for road trips, but we have made the drive to Atlanta which is about a 2 hour drive, and it is dead before we get there.- The pre-loaded movies have yet to actually load. As soon as we set everything up. we tried to watch How to Train Your Dragon (which is one of the three pre-loaded movies) and never could get it to load. It would just stay black, no matter how long we left it. I posted on the Nabi facebook page because I read reviews that the customer service was best through there facebook page. They responded almost immediately with tips on resetting the tablet and other ways to get the movies to preload. We tried everything they suggested over the next several days and nothing worked. We have finally given up on them ever working which is a huge disappointment because they were one of the reasons we initially decided on this tablet.- The passwords for wi-fi and the parental mode are constantly not working. If ever I need to adjust anything in the mommy mode setting, the password I use only works maybe 50% of the time. The other times it will try to load for a few minutes and then finally tell me the password is incorrect. I have used the same password for this tablet since the day we set it up and I will try multiple times to make sure I am not accidentally messing anything up. A few days later I try again, and suddenly the password works again. Same thing for Wi-Fi in certain places. If he ever comes to my work with me, I have to put the wi-fi password in each and every time and several times it will say the password is incorrect even though it is the same one we have had for years. It is almost as if it is just unable to connect internally, so it just gives up and says the password is wrong.-Overall there is nothing this tablet advertises that others dont also have. I really wish we had gone with a different tablet because this one is becoming nothing short of frustrating. I guess we know what he is getting for his 6th birthday...",73482,3871,3872,0,"The tablet was really wonderful while it worked. I was able to set up a profile for each of my children, that way I didn't have to buy a tablet for each of them. It tracks their usage and allows me to limit time on the device and/or specific apps. Unfortunately, after using it for only a couple of months it stopped working. It would just freeze on the boot up screen. I followed to instructions to hard rest the device, wiping out all the settings, profiles and additional apps I had installed myself. We were able to use it after that for a couple more month and then the same thing happened. I did not try to contact support because the one time I called in about a billing question it was very frustrating and not helpful.",73483,3872,3873,2,"This is single worst electronic purchase I've ever made. If you love the person this tablet is intended for, show them you love them by NOT ordering this tablet.We originally ordered one tablet in the middle of last year and it failed after a month. The tablet would not boot into the operating system. Nabi was able to exchange the product at that time for us and sent us another one.We purchased another set of 2 (since we have 3 kids) right before we moved houses. We packed the tablets away for about 4 months and once we unpacked them we realized 2 of them no longer boot. We now have 2 broken tablets out of 3 but when you look at the odds, all 3 tablets were broken. I contacted Nabi support and they kept saying ""we see this a lot, let's fix this by going into the boot screen"".The bootscreen options weren't selectable on either tablet since the preoloader was locking up. It was so bad they admitted that the secret boot menu issue could take ""7 or more tries"" for it to actually work. They are both completely useless. Nabi said we could send them back in but insisted that we pay the shipping and warned us (if there's ANY damage caused by shipping we're blaming you).This is such an awful product. You shouldn't have to pay to return an item that's defective. You shouldn't have a product that fails 3 out of 3 times. I would not trust this or any other merchandise from this company.Outside of these being broken - the original charge and bootup process took quite a few hours for all of the updates to finish. The tablet itself is extremely slow.",73484,3873,3874,2,"**IT ONLY GOT A STAR BECAUSE I HAD TO PUT ONE IN ORDER TO SUBMIT!!!**I ordered this as a birthday present for my daughter. She is 4, ad I didn't think that she was old enough to handle a regular tablet, and felt that a child one was more suitable. The set up was easy. But that was the only thing!!! After setting it up, she plugged in her headphones and played with the tablet all of 3 days. After that she couldn't hear anything. I thought it was the headphones, so we took them out, still couldn't hear anything. Then I goggled the problem and saw that other parents has had the same issue with his tablet. So I finally got it to play without the headphones after resetting the tablet back to factor and setting it up again. Once the setup was complete for the SECOND time, she wasn't able to use any apps that weren't originally apart of the tablet. THAT PART SUCKED!!!! That was the main reason why I bought the tablet, because she could use pre loaded and apps from the Google Play Store at the same time. That was the finally straw and I boxed everything back up to ship back. While printing out the return label I found out that I was only going to get back part of my money because they charged a 15% return fee, and that I had to pay to ship it back to LA. That cost me $23.00 to send back. And I know to some that is not a lot of money, but to me a single parent, that was a unnecessary cost for something that I am returning because it didn't work. I have learned my lesson, will NEVER purchase a Nabi again, and will NEVER purchase from this seller!!!!",73485,3874,3875,1,"I don't know why we continued to buy Nabi tablets after they burned us with the first one, but I regret it. This one was a great deal, and had everything we needed in a tablet, too bad it only worked for a few months. Nabi is no help at all when it comes to customer service.Every tablet we've gotten from them has last a few months then just given up and based on reviews I'm not the only one who has had these issues.This particular one gets stuck on the loading screen forever and wont boot up the table fully. We've asked for help, they told us to factory reset it, or hard reset it, but the menu they describe and steps cannot be done while it is stuck in this current state. Since it is ""out of warranty"" they really don't care one way or another.I wouldn't recommend this, even when it worked it would often run slow, or apps would quit randomly. It's not worth the hassle.",73486,3876,3877,0,"Not happy with this product at all. I ordered it just to have something in my car for my son to watch. The first thing I did was connect it to my WiFi, next I accessed YouTube and wanted to download some Baby Einstein videos. As I was attempting to log into my YouTube account, none of the letter buttons were working. I would push one letter both with my finger and the stylus probably 60 times and the letter might have registered once if at all. I am never one to complain and I have never left anybody a bad review, but for $100 the keys at least should have worked! Sending this tablet back ASAP!",73487,3877,3878,0,"Considering the specs that it 'claims' to have, you would assume it would run better. However, as noted elsewhere, there is no way this has a legitimate 4 gbs of RAM and a true 'octo-core' processor! A tablet with those kinds of specs should run remarkably fast, but this runs like a car with one cylinder working. The screen isn't glass, but some kind of totally cheap, easily scratched plastic. It's worthless for writing on as it's lack of responsiveness prohibits such due to the terrible capacitive abilities of the screen and memory+processing ability. Yes, it's cheap, but they shouldn't be allowed to sell on this site at all, for any price. After reading some of the other remarks, they are apparently misleading as far as the specs go too which is misleading and should be downright illegal. BTW, the power practically drains as soon as you take it off the charger as well.",73488,3878,3879,1,"Whatever you do do not buy this product! This product is a piece of trash and the reason for this is because the Chinese manufacturer that builds this product has hacked the firmware in other words operating system on the phone and they make it look like it has more processing power/memory when in reality it actually only has 2 GB of RAM Â– 16 GB of storage and a very slow arm processor.This is one of the largest scams going on right now on Amazon and also on the Chinese market, so I highly recommend not buying this product because it is just a piece of trash the tablet crashes all the time because the operating system is so old and the operating system is actually android for which is android Kit Kat which is a very old version of android.I contacted the company that makes these tablets and they would never tell me anything on the actual hardware components of this tablet therefore I had to actually pull it apart and look at the components myself because the tablet died on me and is no longer working so I highly recommend not buying this tablet because it is not stable and the battery overheated all the time.Hope this helps someone avoid this scam.",73489,3879,3880,0,"I bought this tablet after another reviewer said he was able to cast to Youtube and a Firestick .

All so cloud-based that software, like Excel (which has to be leased separately) randomly closes while you are working.

And a few times a week when you attempt to open your most recent version you get an insulting message that apologizes and offers no options. Your work is gone. Poof.No easy opportunity to build files and store them on the computer but they are squirreled away in the cloud and you are left wondering if ever you will see them again.Update: ONE day after my return window closed I found out that this CANNOT download drivers so you cannot scan directly to it. The suggest scanning to another device then sending it to this one!",73491,3881,3882,1,Purchased this model from B&H Photo and I have to say I really do not like it. Normally I have enjoyed all my Chromebooks but this model IMHO is way overpriced for what you get. You can buy models 1/3 this cost and be just as happy if not happier with your purchase. I have a Samsung model that works as well and seems higher quality. I also had the unit quit 2 months after purchasing it and it was like pulling teeth to get help from Google. B&H only covered it for 30 days. Google was supposed to cover it for 1 year. Google IMHO has the worst support staff I have ever dealt with. They wanted to do everything by email after my initial call and it would be 4 or 5 days between emails going back and forth trying to get them to replace a dead computer. I would stay as far away from this computer as you can. Just my advice from my experience.,73492,3882,3883,0,"therer are some really nice things about this computer. it is fast and easy to use and it is simple. but it is also really limited in what it can do. also there is very limited support. the glass on the back of the top broke. i didnt drop it or hit it. i actually have no idea how it broke. things break, thats just life right, but there is absolutely no way to get it fixed. google just wont sell parts. i guess they are trying to be like apple? its amazing to me there is no way to fix this. it doesnt affect the functionality of the computer it is true but it affects the aesthetic and the aesthetic is a part of what i like about pixelbook and is why google hired Alberto Villareal to design the pixelbook.",73493,3883,3884,0,"I wanted to love this product.

The speaker just randomly started getting distorted and crackling at normal volume. The pixelbook is already not known for it's speaker and audio playback, and I knew that, and I could live with that. What I can't live with is this distortion and crackling, making it impossible to listen or play anything.

When we called Google to ask to return the item we were told it was outside of the 14 day return policy since my husband purchased it back in the end of November ( it was only a week after Christmas though when we called). We were told our only option was to get a replacement for it. They would not send another new one, only a refurbished one. We just received the refurbished computer and it doesnt work either. We charged it and tried to turn it on, and it is making very lound noises and just shuts down when we try to sign in. When we called again to ask if we can now return the product they still redused. We now have to wait another week or two to get another refurbished one. It is now February and I still have not been able to use this Christmas gift.

Video chat has been my only way to see my wife, kids and pets on a daily basis. Not to mention when you can connect the quality is lower than it was in 2005. I purchased this as a cheaper version to do so. If you want this as a way to video chat or really do any form of communication in real time DO NOT buy this. We have tried facebook messenger and skype and pretty much every other common communication app/website you can think of. We have tried the app version and website version of everything. The bad news does not stop there every app i have installed(facebook, spotify, amazon) will either run incredibly slowly or stop running entirely. The only thing I have been able to use without much hit to speed or quality is youtube.

I attempted to transfer files and it was not happening. I contacted their support and was informed that the tablet required a proprietary cable that I had to purchase from them. This information was not supplied on their page at Amazon and also did not appear in their manual in the section dealing with connecting tablet to computer. Not sure if this omission was purposefully or inadvertently done.Initially gave this a 3 star for the above issue however I have edited my review to a 1 star after finding that the USB cable needed for the process of transferring data between my computer and tablet which today is a basic use for tablets / computers cost $23.00.

I do not recommend this item.",73499,3889,3890,0,"Bottom line up front: Fresh out of the box, the tablet was unable to perform the most basic of tasks such as opening PDFs, PNGs, and word documents. It even failed to update apps from the play store or install them properly.Full review: I was in the market for an inexpensive 2n1 to use for school when I was away from home. I only needed something basic with a keyboard and this seemed to fit my needs. The problem is that it failed to meet those bare minimal requirements. The first problem I had was that it was a struggle to update apps from the Google Play store. It took several restarts and dozens of failed attempts before I was finally able to update Chrome (it was a 31mb update) along with most of the other apps. Some apps continued to fail to install their updates (such as Android System Webview) so I just moved on.It completely failed to open messenger. The app would open and as the login screen came up, a prompt telling me that the app has failed and needed to close prevented me from using it even though the cursor was flashing in the app behind it. So I installed messenger lite and moved on.It did manage to sync my google accounts pretty easily but that was the first, last, and only thing it did successfully. Attempting to open PDFs prompted me with the message ""The document cannot be opened because it's not a valid pdf-document"" no other device has had any issue opening the same file. At this point I'm wondering if anything worked so I just try to open different file types:docx: crashedpng: barely and it struggled with zooming in and scrolling aroundI took a glance at the memory usage to figure out why it struggled with everything. The Android OS alone used 67% of the tablet's processing power. By this point I just accepted it as a loss, closed it and went about my day.I didn't have a lot of demands for this product being that it was only $120 but opening word docs, PDFs, and images is a pretty low standard to meet. The fact that this product couldn't even do that or even update apps properly is nothing short of embarrassing.",73500,3890,3891,2,"I love this laptop, the performance is very good, but it is too HOT, I can not place it on my legs, when I use the keyboard I feel the heat. It's hot even when it does basic tasks like surfing the internet. When I use it for work (editing or design with adobe) the battery lasts 4 hours.It gets very hot, on the edges of the keyboard and below it.When you charge, your charger gets hotter, I can not even touch it, I have to wait for it to cool for a few hours.Configure the performance in the synapse app but it does not help at all to solve the heat problem, you can improve the fan revolutions but the noise is too much.",73501,3891,3892,0,"I love the labtop, great for gaming and work.

I was also using a pretty big composition book, like 9.75x7.5, so they probably would look better with something smaller.",73509,3899,3900,1,"So disappointed in this product. I bought them for an easy mess free way to decorate our Easter eggs. More than 2/3 of the tape were all the same pattern, this white tape with green patches on it. Some of them were even plain white. Ended up throwing them away because they were vibrant or fun at all. Thankfully I ordered Washi tape from a different brand at the same time just in case. DO NOT BUY THESE, I DONT CARE HOW CHEAP THEY ARE.",73510,3900,3901,2,"I was so excited to receive these and immediately did a swatch sheet to see how the colors appeared. I received multiples of a couple tones and a couple tones are missing. Also, the product photo shows there is a watercolor blender brush, and the description says it comes with one, but mine didn't. I bought these because of the convenience of a watercolor affect without having to set up for painting.. so to not have the blender paint brush defeats the purpose of having these. They aren't worth purchasing the blender separately and it isn't worth the hassle of bringing out a paint brush and glass of water because at that point I'd rather use my watercolor paints, especially since these colors are flat. Horrible purchase. Will return and will never purchase Arteza products again.",73511,3901,3902,0,all but two of my 48 pack are dried out. the thought was nice but the quality is awful. I guess I didnt read enough reviews. this was one set I was super excited to get and I took out one of my 20.00 water color papers and had the design ready to start and got nothing but the water on my paper. . they look great in the but one swipe and all i have is a clear brush and no color. best to go back to the old fashion way. arteza dont give up. just improve the quality as this is a real fail.,73512,3902,3903,0,"I hate to say this bc IÂ’ve been looking forward to these for a really long time, but these are pretty bad.TheyÂ’re glorified markers. DonÂ’t expect watercolors and to make a beautiful, delicate and classy painting with these. TheyÂ’re just markers that write smooth bc of the constant supply of Â“inkÂ”. You will still get the marks when you Â“color inÂ” and see every stroke as you do with a marker. The colors are very strong, not the typical subtle watercolors, so if you make a mistake there wonÂ’t be water that can soften it, itÂ’s sort of an nothing or all deal.IÂ’m really disappointed, Im going to return them, itÂ’s not worth the money they cost. I can paint with my prismacolor markers and at least they donÂ’t leave a stroke.I tried painting something tonight and it was like when you put liquid eyeliner and you mess up so you try to fix it by adding more, and more, and more, and at the end itÂ’s a train wreck. ThatÂ’s how painting with these felt.",73513,3903,3904,1,"These are an absolute joke. They are almost all dry as heck... I read so many rave reviews, but I must say these fall very short of my expectations. These are essentially just markers with a brush tip. There is absolutely nothing ""Watercolor"" about these aside from the fact that is is a water based ink. I can't believe I threw away the packaging before actually giving all of the markers a shot, because I would definitely be returning them if not for the fact that I do not have the original packaging. Don't let the reviews fool you. Unless I got a dud batch, I absolutely do not understand the 3, 4 and 5 star reviews.",73514,3904,3905,0,"I had these for two weeks and didn't use them much. Any time i tried to use it I had to try really hard to get the color to come out. The first picture is just the swatches after alot of layering. the second one shows the swatches with one swipe of color and the one below it is after multiple layering. The water brush pen that comes with it lets out wayyyy to much water, kind ruins the piece, also it leaks from the side. These in no way replace Tombows (i only own 1 Tombow marker and its better than this). It also doesn't make art easier, just harder, the brush is hard to handle, hairs are out of place, and their just doesn't perform well.",73515,3905,3906,0,"The first thing I noticed about these pens was how cheap and light the felt in my hands. For the price and being a ""premium"" marker I anticipated a bit more weight to the product. They have the feel of a cheap knock off brand marker, not even close to actual fine tip Crayola markers which is what I had expected the barrels to be similar to. This makes me wonder how long each is going to last, as there can't be much ink contained in them. The ""brush"" tip is very firm and you cannot get very good calligraphy type lines with it but it is nice to color with and you can actually really minimize stroke lines so there is that. On good quality paper they look like regular water based markers with good pigment, still blotchy but that's pretty much a given unless you upgrade to alcohol based markers. I do like the colors but I wish there had been more neutral or lighter tones (really there are too many blues that are rather close!). I got these as markers I could throw in my bag and play around with in my bullet journal, and I think they will work fine for that but I think I could have gotten a regular set of fine tip Crayolas for less cost and been just has happy. My last comment is that I really like the tin, even if I'm storing them elsewhere, but I love tins for storage so I might be a little biased.",73516,3906,3907,2,"I bought these markers because I've been practicing hand lettering. I didn't expect these to be the best ever markers, but they left me completely underwhelmed and I'm planning on giving them away.Pros:*Mostly vivid colors* Nice tin* Good priceCons:* One marker was dried up (see 2nd picture)* Brush doesn't stay straight, but bends with pressure forcing you to rotate the marker in your hands as you write.(see picture)* Because each end has it's own color (and therefore, ink) I feel that these won't last long because only half of the barrel is for the brush end. So, if you're mostly using one end, they may not last as long as another marker like a Tombow. This is just a prediction, but it makes sense.Changes I'd like to see:* I wish the fine tip colors were just slightly darker than the brush color to allow you to use them for making patterns or accents within the larger strokes of the brush.*A slightly stiffer brush so you don't have to rotate it.All in all, these were okay, but I feel the brush bending will aggravate those who are just starting off with brush lettering. Nice idea by Crayola, but I don't feel it was well executed. I hope this helps!",73517,3907,3908,0,"I received my markers today and was quite disappointed that the orange marker was dried out. There was a crack on the barrel which dried out the marker..this is the the reason I have only given 2 stars to this product. One of my biggest pet peeves is when I open a new marker or pen and it is dried out. So frustrating! I realize that these are crayola markers and was able to get the ink running by dipping it in some water, but why should I have to do this when I did not dry out the marker? Otherwise, I love the case and I like the fact that the bullet point is a shade lighter than the brush tip.",73518,3908,3909,0,"I bought this product to do light calligraphy with in hopes that it might be an adequate substitute to tombow fudenosuke brush tip dual pens. Boy, were my dreams shattered when I bought these and tested them out. They are very hard to control and have a creeping effect on paper (they seep slowly outwards producing blurry lines). Calligraphy is near impossible with the brush tip. Also, it makes little sense to have pens with different colors on either side of them because they could have been used together to created fine and thick lines but due to their differing shades, you can't. I'm severely disappointed. I expected more from crayola because their supertips are awesome. Maybe one day they'll come out with $10 superbrushtips. That'll be the day.",73519,3909,3910,0,"Personally I love art and take it seriously. I have been looking for a marker brand that suits me but, these markers were just a clear disappointment. I should have been smart, judging by my extreme hate for Crayola (Especially the crayons) I should of made the right decision and wished for a higher quality brand then ""Crayola"". To start off, a clear problem with these is that the brush tip is extremely flimsy and starts breaking within a few days. Another problem is that the small tip breaks up paper when used and it's extremely irritating but I guess that's what you have to deal with for a $11 product. Also the caps don't stay on easily and falls off unless an a extreme amount of pressure is applied, sadly, most of the markers dried out and are impossible to use because of those flimsy caps. on a high note though, the colors are great and have a beautiful color when I'm doing calligraphy but that's about it.",73520,3910,3911,2,"As I write this, I don't yet know if I will have to return this product. It might be damaged to the point of not being usable but the fault is not with the product itself. The problem is with Amazon and their choice of how to ship the mats.I have been quilting for almost 30 years and have used every kind of rotary cutting mat - including Fiskars mats - and one of the first things you learn is how quickly and easily these mats can warp - usually with permanent results. So when I ordered two (2) of the 24"" x 36"" mats from Amazon, I expected the mats to be shipped in a large, flat, thin box. Instead, Amazon chose to fold the mat in half and ship it in a box measuring 24"" x 16"" x 8"". That was irresponsible given the nature of the product.To compound the problem, did I mention that I live in Phoenix, Arizona and the mat was purchased and shipped in August? Couldn't Amazon foresee that might be a problem? The product is such that shipping the mats in such a manner is equally problematic for mats shipped to northern Michigan in the dead of winter. Call me crazy but I expected Amazon to have enough product knowledge to know how best to ship the products they sell.Since the mats were still very warm and somewhat pliable when I removed them from the boxes - yes, boxes... Amazon chose to ship the mats separately - I am cautiously optimistic that they might be flat again after laying on a flat table with other mats on top of it. If that doesn't happen, the mats will be returned and I will purchase these mats elsewhere.Just so you know, the mats do have an odor to them that is customary to any new rotary cutting mat. It is already disappearing. Let's hope the rather dramatic curve does too.And no, I am not overly concerned about the potential cancer-causing warnings. I have no intentions of eating or licking my cutting mat, and given the barrage of chemicals, food-related hormones and other carcinogens I encounter in everyday life, I doubt that my use of these rotary mats is going to be the tipping point. The dire warning labels are likely the result of some well-intentioned but nonetheless slightly overwrought crusading lawyer.",73521,3911,3912,1,"I submitted a previous review that was declined because I referenced a sticker that Amazon places on this item that leaves a sticky residue (yes, IÂ’ll take that up with the shipper), but IÂ’m glad it was declined, because now I can share that after having used this mat ONCE, there are permanent carved marks anywhere where IÂ’ve cut fabric with my rotary cutter. IÂ’ve owned Olga, Dritz, and even various off-brands of cutting mats and IÂ’ve never seen it do this (see photos IÂ’m including with my review).These were purchased at my request as a Â“giftÂ”, so I canÂ’t even return/replace with a different brand.WORST CUTTING MAT IÂ’VE EVER USED!(FWIW, I have two of these bought at the same time. I thought maybe IÂ’d just gotten a single Â“offÂ” product, but I just checked the other one and it, too, has Â“carvedÂ” marks in it where IÂ’ve used my rotary cutter. TERRIBLE.)(Note: you can also see the permanent sticky residue left by the stickers Amazon places on these matsÂ— IÂ’ve scrubbed it with Goo Gone, used vegetable oil, used soap, household cleaners, etc. Nothing will remove the residue.",73522,3912,3913,2,"I had read about the smell of this cutting mat, but some of the reviews said their mat didn't have a smell. So, I took a chance. I'm sorry to say that the smell was much too strong, even after airing it out, and I returned the two mats. Then I went to Walmart and checked out their mats which are identical to these, brand and all. They, too, had a strong smell. However, the smaller Fiskars mat (18"" X 24"") at Walmart didn't have the smell. It is also a self-healing mat, but it's a different color. I don't know if the color has anything to do with it, but I bought the smaller mat and am using it. Everything is fine so far. I don't think I have ever advised against a product from Amazon, but I would advise folks not to buy these Fiskars 36"" X 24"" mats if they don't like strong chemical smells!",73523,3913,3914,1,"Despite some concerns about purchasing this due to the 'bad smell' reviews... we went ahead and bought one.

It just stinks like a paper mill (sort of sulferous), with overtones of Napthalene (moth balls). Scrubbed it with alcohol and soap water, leaving outside for a few days, and will return it if the stink hasn't left it by then!

I have 2 black, 2 red, 1 green, 1 pink, 1 teal, 1 purple, 1 dark blue, and 1 orange. No yellow or brown. I got these pens specifically for the yellow pen as I use this color in my color coding system for my classes. Will be returning.",73548,3940,3941,0,"Beautiful colors that for the most part don't smear or bleed through, but the tips split easily. One split the first day I used it, another split a couple weeks later. I now need to buy another pack from a different brand since I need several uniform pens in different colors. Too bad they have no durability.The pics show close ups of the tips of the dark blue (badly split) and the light blue (starting to split). You can see the thicker and doubled lines the split tips draw compared to the still intact purple tip. Also you may want to note the similarity between the purple and dark blue colors. Not easy to differentiate between the two colors at a glance. Sending this defective product back.",73549,3941,3942,0,"I have to say I love the colors. They all come out really well and don't bleed through. I also like how it writes but I hate that if you don't put the lid on precisely, you'll ruin the pen all together. It frays the tip.I'm down 2 pens in 2 days and others are starting to go in the same direction :(You really have to baby these pens or not they are pretty much done. I've had them for 2 days and used them to underline for readings and taking notes.",73550,3942,3943,2,"Okay, let's be honest, these pens were less than $6. Given the price, I really shouldn't have expected much. However, I've only had these two days and two of the pens have already broken & the ink completely stopped working in another. I wasn't two words into a sentence, when the felt tip part the pen split and the felt tip actually fell out of the other. Now, I know what you're thinking, but I was not applying undo pressure ... Just normal writing.The actual pen itself is very thin. Thinner than the LePen or Stabilo brand pens, which I guess is fine if you're like me and have small hands. If not, you may find these hard to hold. Additionally, the outside of the pen is made of flimsy, plastic that actually bends when you're writing. (Again, normal writing. Not pressing down firmly.) In one review, a lady said upon arrival she found they were not what she expected so she had given them to a grandchild to use. I can assure you, a child would break the tips off these pens in no time. The cap must be FIRMLY snapped back on and as ridiculous as this sounds, is no small undertaking. In my opinion, they are not worth $6.",73551,3943,3944,1,"Liked em at first but two big issues with them.1) The tip is delicate and the inside of the cap is designed in such a way that if you don't re-cap the pen carefully each time, you risk splitting the felt tip in two -- resulting in double lines when you write. I ruined 2 of them this way -- it's easy to do because you end up recapping them a lot since they are like markers and you don't want them to dry out by leaving the cap off.2) The writing on certain materials fades. I wrote something on a wall calendar about 2 weeks ago with the pink pen and just today I walked by it and it was like the writing disappeared. It just faded and you could not tell what had been written. It doesn't do this with absorbent paper (like a regular notebook) as far as I can tell, but on slightly glossy paperstock like what a wall calendar is made of, the writing will only last 2 weeks.Furthermore, the company contacted me and said they would give me a full refund if I took down this negative review. I refuse to contribute to the growing unreliability of Amazon reviews. They're really not terrible pens, just beware of these above issues.Edit Feb 2019: It seems to not just be glossy paper that this writing fades on, but also regular paper. Example pic attached (3rd pic). The common denominator seems to be exposure to light, so it seems this ink is not photostable.",73552,3944,3945,1,"I bought a pack of this to complete some Valentine orders for customers; I print on a BizHub toner printer. Suddenly, my graphics were grainy and faded. I spent 2 days trying different settings, thinking my printer was malfunctioning. Talked to a tech, spent time cleaning the printer, reinstalling drivers, and replacing toner cartridges, with no change. I finally decided to try 5 other paper stocks I had in hand (paper & cardstocks). Graphics printed perfect on every one of them. Ran the Neenah Exact Index Card Stock 110lb (this is not 110lb cardstock, by the way, it is 110lb index stock which is much ligher), and the graphics were faded and grainy again. Returned the paper, bought more generic (cheap) card stock from Walmart and I'm back in business. Don't buy this paper!!!",73553,3945,3946,1,"This is NOT 110 lb Heavy cardstock. I compared it to a sheet of 110 lb cardstock that I bought at Michaels. The Michaels paper is much heavier. I did further research. The Michael's cardstock is 110lb/300gsm. The Neenah paper is 110lb/199gsm. This explains why the Neenah paper is so much lighter that what you expect cardstock of that weight to be. There are different categories of cardstock. The 110lb COVER paper-which is the MIchael's cardstock- is 298 gsm and the 110lb INDEX cardstock - which is the NEENAH paper- is 199gsm. It's confusing because both papers are 110lb. The 110 lb INDEX paper is the equivalent of 74 lb COVER cardstock. The listing should clearly state that this is NOT heavyweight 110 lb cardstock. If you want heavy 110lb card stock DO NOT buy this paper. The higher the gsm nunber, the heavier the paper is. ",73554,3946,3947,0,Not satisfied at all but I didn't have time to return the item. The ream of paper had been previously ripped open and retaped. Several sheets were soiled; looked like someone had walked on them with their shoes that is how dirty the paper looked. I threw away those pages. The quality of this paper is pretty rough and I haven't used it yet. I wanted a heavy weight paper for card making. The paper color is what I would call heavily creamed coffee; pretty yellow. I wanted something lighter.,73555,3947,3948,0,"I bought this product with the understanding that it was 110lb paper. I used to work in a commercial office supply place, this is clearly not 110lb paper. Not to mention I also received the same day 105lb paper from another vendor. The 105lb was definitely a much stiffer paper, what I expected. I am pretty sure that someone messed something up. I donÂ’t know what the 110 is supposed to represent on the label but it is not the weight of the paper. I added a photo of a chart I found online. 199g/m2 is the equivalent of 53lb paper. Not what I was looking for. It is definitely listed wrong. There are multiple places in the listing stating it is 110lb paper.",73556,3948,3949,0,"I will start by saying the card stock is fine. The paper is not business card rigid, but close. I have made some business cards with it, but they are not as good as professionally printed cards. This will make good home made greeting cards and the like. My wife makes birthday announcements for the kids, the kids use it for school and fun, and I use it for dividers and covers in reports/files. It is great for all that and much more economical than getting the same stuff from the local Office store.However, the two stars is due to the packaging. I don't know if it was not secure in the box it shipped within and the weight of the card stock broke open the paper packaging around it, or if the paper packaging was torn when originally boxed up. But it arrived to me with the wrapper torn almost all the way around. This let about 1/3 of the paper to come out of the packaging and it was ruined by being bent between other items in the box. All the corners of the paper were also bent. I could only salvage about 1/4 of the card stock for any proper use. I guess the kids get the rest for coloring and good paper airplanes.To be fair I did not contact Amazon to give them a chance to do anything. I needed the paper for an immediate project so couldn't return it and for what it cost it wasn't worth the hassle of a return.",73557,3949,3950,0,"Absolutely love the colors in this set. I rate them in the ratio of colors and I would say this is a great combination.I really love my Ohuhu alcohol markers. While I'm not a huge fan of the chisel tip they do a great job with the small tip as well. And the chisel tip does stand up to punishment! I would say the colors are comparable to Copic's except for the lightfast property (which I am told they aren't equal but actually can't tell myself). They are beautiful colors. I am disappointed about them coming out with the set of 120 about a week after I bought the 100 set, but that is really the only complaint I have. I really want to love these pens too!Having said that they fail to do what I purchased them to do. I bought them to use for calligraphy. A good portion of the brush tips have gone mushy just swatching them. I would want them to be flexible but the color is separating and the points are impossible to get thin lines from. The black pen thin tip is mushy too. I used it to write the colors and lines on my swatching page. If you get these to use as colors in a coloring book or anything that doesn't require precision, this is a great deal and the colors are really nice. They just aren't good for calligraphy.",73558,3950,3951,0,"So if you are just using these for coloring books or something then they will work well. The problem lies in the advertising. They say they are brush tips and also that they can be used for brush lettering. There is a stock photo of brush lettering, but I know they didn't use this product for that. The nibs are hardly flexible and they came frayed. One of the nibs came compressed down so it looked like a flat topped bullet nib and had ZERO flexibility. These do activate with water nicely though and if you want them to use as watercolor type markers then they will serve you well I think. Just be careful with details. But they don't do well with thin linessl whatsoever. They can't do extra thick downstrokes either. You could probably get better brush lettering results with Crayola supertips. The fineliners are okay, a little dry in my opinion, but they work alright. For the price these aren't an awful deal but they definitely need to refine the advertising because these don't get as thin of lines as the advertisement shows. I've heard nothing but good things about Ohuhu as a brand and I've heard good things about their customer service. So I reached out to them to see if they would be willing to send me some of their real brush pens to try out for brush lettering, since I don't have time to go through the trouble of returning this set. They kind of beat around the bush a little bit saying that one of the listings for replacement I sent them wasn't their listing (but it was) and then finally they agreed to send me a 48 set of the real brush tip pens. So we will see how those go. But just be wary of these and know they are not fit for brush lettering cause they aren't flexible and they aren't durable when used with pressure. And they nibs aren't consistent. But hey, my daughter will have a new set of markers to color with I guess! ",73559,3951,3952,0,"Very up set and disappointed. I got these markers for my daughter for Christmas and we were both disappointed. We might have gotten a bad batch, but that is not an excuse for the carelessness of the product. Many of the markers fine tips were dead or broken. And some of the brush ends didnÂ’t even have ink in them. Overall this was a bad purchase and I hope it can either be refunded or I can get another kit for my daughter. Made Christmas very upsetting as it always is with a bad gift.",73560,3952,3953,1,"Sadly, weÂ’ve only used 10 of these and they have all leaked! My daughter paid for these herself with allowance she earned and was excited to use them for Art time in class. She actually came home crying because she got it trouble for these pens leaking everywhere and staining the classroom desk. Out of the 10 weÂ’ve used all are leaking a ridiculous amount. Of course I want to return these for a refund so my daughter can use her money on something else as I am not taking a chance on the others leaking and staining more things but the return window has closed! I would appreciate the company reaching out to us to fix the issue. In fact, two other girls from her class have had their moms contact me for the link to this product to order because the girls all want to have these in class. I will be letting the parents know not to order because after 3- 4 uses they will leak and be useless.",73561,3953,3954,0,"For the most part, I really liked these markers. I liked that the tip was firm, without much give. This allowed me to do special coloring. The reason for one star is the lack of colors. I ordered because the colors showed were really pretty colors. I did not get these colors. I got six orange and eight red with very little color variation. The rest of the colors are muddy The markers are not smooth and the paper is rough after coloring I am very disappointed in having to send them back because I had hoped for markers with beautiful colors.

If you have to color a large area, they leave uneven marks where the color overlaps its self. They also tend to tear up the paper, no matter how light of a touch you use, which surprised me. I did try these on different types of art paper and never got a good result. I'm very disappointed.",73563,3955,3956,0,"Really wanted to love these..Just such trash. Seriously think my crayolas work better!Firstly they're water based so I knew what I was getting, I wanted them to blend nicely with a bit of water. But this pack is such a mess. Maybe all the positive reviews gave me too much expectations. this set is good for children messing around NOT good quality work, not even good for practice. And far to expensive for child's play.PROS:- Brush pen is nice!- Very affordable- Large variety of shadesCONS:- This pack doesn't know if it wants to be a cool, warm or neutral grey! They should have all been the same tone because they don't match up and look strange next to one another.- The color on the caps doesn't match the ink. The dark colors were fine, but 5 of the lighter shades were not as they appeared. a light cap would have darker ink than the ink in a darker cap. Gotta swatch.- The blender isn't very effective. And is too harsh on the paper, bringing me to my next problem- The nibs & ink EAT away the paper so bad! If you layer too much ink the paper will get soft & crumbly. If you try to blend any too markers together even heavy press paper will start to flake & warp.- The ink is super streaky. No matter how fast and smooth I layered it just wouldn't dry a solid color. And if I tried to add another layer to thicken/blend it the paper gave way.- The colors don't look nice. Thy're not vibrant. I mean they're greys but if you've ever used black India ink or grey copics, primacolors or Twin Touch markers you'd know they have life. the colors are solid and true and look bright.Anyways they might be worth you trying out. but they weren't for me :/ Guess I got what I paid for, investing a bit more is worth it.",73564,3956,3957,1,"If you are wanting, as I was, a set of nine pens of gradations of grays from the darkest-dark to the lightest-light, all in the same color family, do not buy this set. It is a mix of cool grays, warm grays, a French gray, and, even more bizarre, a pen with a color closer to a Lilac as you'd find, for example, in Prismacolor's color line of markers. As I was picking up the contents of my own set after studying them, I realized I truly had no use for them. So, rather than take them to my studio where they would only gather dust, I tossed them out. I truly have no use for them and feel that Tombow advertised them in a way that would sell well -- but either to unsuspecting buyers like me or, worse, to aspiring artists not yet trained well enough in art to know there are different families of grays. Because of this, many inexperienced artists may think these pens are helping them grasp the concept of working out a composition in values found on a grayscale, but the gradations of value found in a properly executed grayscale are not in this set. If you want to learn what different types of grays there are, this may be a good set for you, but, if you're expecting to receive markers that are representative of a true grayscale (markers that will help you to accurately pre-plan the value-structure of a serious composition), you won't find it here.",73565,3957,3958,0,"I am an established artist and frequently use art markers.

The colors they produce are nothing like what's on the cap, so I had to make a little chart displaying what each pen would actually produce. On top of that, the pens color like a glorified Crayola marker. They make dark streaks if you draw a line over another, and the blending marker does absolutely nothing. They tear up the fibers of the paper and bleed through, chewing up the paper.The only time these pens produced a decent result was when I used them as detail work on a watercolor paper canvas. Using these for an area larger than a stroke is a bad idea, though, and it brought down the quality of the piece significantly.",73567,3959,3960,2,"I was looking forward to putting all our pictures in a family photo album; however, once I received the album I realized that the pages are not big enough for an 8x10.

I will not be buying anymore.",73568,3960,3961,0,"Although I have two college degrees, I guess I am not very smart. I cannot see any way to open the pages to place pictures underneath the clear plastic. I do not want to go through the hassle of returning the album if it is even possible to return it after it has been opened. Also, I do not want to tear up the pages trying to slide pictures underneath the plastic coverings. I guess I will have to place pictures loosely inside the album. That would be better than no album at all. I have some old cards with pictures of race cars on them that I had planned to place in the album but now I am going to leave them loose and find a good plastic envelope that is large enough to hold them.

I can deal with the fact that the book is just plain ugly- I purchased it for the functionality, of which it has none. The pages have almost no adhesive on them so good luck getting anything to stick, and the clear film is akin to the cellophane that a pack of gum is wrapped in. It is so paper thin that on the first pull open it left permanent creases and marks in the plastic. But the best part (and yes I'm being sarcastic) is that the pages themselves are 2 inches smaller in circumference than the binder. So you have this giant ugly book with these tiny little pages!?!? I have other old skool photo books that have sturdy pages with good adhesive and decent clear plastic covers. This book unfortunately is no where near that quality.",73570,3963,3964,0,It would have been fair to mention that the album will not take an 8X10. It was deceiving when the description states that the pages are 8.5x10.5. ThatÂ’s true if one measures from the edge to edge but you canÂ’t put the photo to the edge because of the three holes. Even trimming my photo to 7.5 inches so it would fit I found the plastics overlay is about 2 and 1/2 inches too short in width to cover the entire photo. Cheap price but lacks what I bought it for.

The mat sticks so strongly to the medium (vinyl, HTV, cardstock, contact paper, freezer paper) that it has literally pulled the adhesive off the mat and destroyed the design. The original mat that came with my Silhouette is still doing fine, just kind of beat up from lots of use. I'm getting ready to start a sizable project for church and that is why I wanted a replacement mat, so I could keep a cut going without down time. No where does it say that this is a second quality product or a rejected first quality, but it certainly appears that way and I m very frustrated about it. I have a new 12x24 mat ordered, it should be here today. I hope it does better. This purchase was definitely a waste of my money.",73572,3965,3966,2,"This mat is awful! I've used a lot of these over the years and the last 2 I've purchased have been terrible. The first one I did what I always do and press it on a cushion to destick slightly.

I've even left it out hoping for dust to settle or something! I cannot use it effectively. Also, the edges of the mat are rippling. The plastic is separating from itself.

I recommend buying mats from reputable sellers, Joann's, Michaels, Hobby Lobby, Silhouette website. Not 'Silhouette America' on amazon.",73574,3967,3968,1,"I have ordered over 200 of these mats since I began buying them on Amazon in 2013 for my small business. Until recently, I have never been disappointed in the 12x12 mats - they were always high quality and had a good life expectancy. However, for the last 6-7 months or so, EVERY SINGLE mat I have ordered on Amazon (30-35 total) has been defective. Additionally, 18 out of 21 mats I received directly from Silhouette were defective. The adhesive on the mats comes off after one use. It comes off on my projects. It rubs off using the scraper. It bubbles, it splits, it pulls, it is terrible. On a few occasions, all of the adhesive came off on the blue cover paper and none was left on the mat!Every single mat that was defective had the same manufacture date - 11/08/16. The three mats I received directly from Silhouette that were not defective had different manufacture dates. Silhouette America is well aware of this is issue. They have said as much in correspondence to myself and other customers. So, my question is - why are they still selling these defective mats? Why am I still receiving mats via subscribe and save with this manufacture date? Why have they not pulled the 11/08/16 mats from Amazon? I would imagine that this is very possible - expensive for sure but doable and yet it is not happening. Has anyone also noticed that the price on these mats started dropping in Jan/Feb and were almost 50% off for two months straight? If you look at any website that tracks price history of Amazon products, this can be confirmed. These mats have never, ever been priced so low for such a sustained period of time - the historical stats also bear that out.In my opinion - I think they are trying to get rid of as many of these crap mats as possible through this apparent fire sale here on Amazon. Because even if some of us return these defective products, there are some that can't or won't. That helps them offset what must be huge losses for this bad batch of product. There is no other reason I can think of why a company as large and capable as Silhouette America has not been able to get these defective mats off the shelves for over half a year and I, for one, find it infuriating. Take your losses Silhouette and stop trying to pawn these terrible defective mats off on your paying customers!",73575,3968,3969,1,"Not the classic Silhouette mat like what comes with the machine!! It's a cheap alternative with a way too sticky adhesive initially, and then it doesn't hold worth anything once you try to de-sticky the mat like the classic ACTUAL Silhouette mats. I've been using my original Silhouette mat for several months and decided to replace mine with this one because of cost. They are totally different materials and adhesives even. The blue paper that ""protects"" the mats adhesive area should stick somewhat to keep things from sticking to it when not in use, but it slides right off this one.

I received this as a gift and, as someone who has quite a collection of markers I am not sure I'd buy these again, but for someone starting a collection, this could be a good start.

I emailed them and this is the colors of their markers so I guess IÂ’m just not a fan. I just recommend you do your research before investing making to sure youÂ’ll be happy with the color options. Great markers for a budget or beginner tho. Nice and juicy and IÂ’ve found no dry markers yet.,73578,3971,3972,0,"I purchased and made swatches of these markers this past April, 2018. I was thinking of using them at the end of July, 2018, so I pulled the swatches. Many of the colors had aged to the same dark color! I had put them on both white and black-backed paper because I knew that the different backgrounds changes how the colors look. The pages were kept either in a notebook (white) or Jade Summers Color Charts book (black-backed), so they were not exposed to sunlight. The darkening happened on both types of paper. I didn't count how many of the colors did this, but it's definitely more than 10. I'll probably keep those colors that still look OK, but I wouldn't have purchased the set if I'd known this was going to happen.

I was incredibly disappointed in these markers. (I'll keep it kinda short for Amazon, but I may do a longer review at my site.) Let me list the problems I had with them:1. They smell significantly louder than any other brand of alcohol markers I have. Most alcohol markers have some type of light scent but these were noticeably louder.2. There are too many dark and saturated colors, and not enough pale, pastel and light colors. Viewing the images of the pens on Amazon, you wouldn't able to tell this fact because of the cap colors.3. Entirely too many of the cap colors were significantly different than the actual marker color. Making a swatch sheet is very necessary, but using markers should never feel like blindly picking colors. And never let anybody make you feel stupid for asking for a better color match between the actual ink and the cap.4. Over a dozen of them already had the number fading off the top.Look, I'm not expecting perfection from cheap markers. I love the cheapy TouchFive markers and their many versions. (The ""Touch Soft Head"" is my fave of the TouchFive line). But, again, with Caliart there were too many problems to deal with. Like...pick one thing to cut corners on; not everything!If you're looking for a cheap marker, do yourself a favor and try to get the Touch Soft Head markers (or any of the Touch-brand markers). Or, spend just a little more for the Finecolour BRUSH markers (the black ones that say ""EF102"" are the BRUSH version.)https://www.amazon.com/Finecolour-Markers-Colored-Drawing-Artists/dp/B0728KS3QM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1511327740&sr=8-1&keywords=finecolour%2Bbrush&th=1It's rare for me not to recommend a marker because they all pretty much function the same at the end of the day. It's the build and the type of nibs that really determine if it's a great marker. But, I can't recommend the Caliart brand.",73580,3973,3974,2,I bought these markers hoping they'd be a good intro into using alcohol based markers and because I wasn't willing to spend that much on copic markers just yet. I am a beginner and watched various tutorials and even attempted to use rubbing alcohol to blend better but was not successful. These feel like regular crayola markers - very average and not worth the price. I would not recommend this product if you're looking to create artwork with blended colors. These would work well for a coloring book but not for advanced artwork.,73581,3974,3975,0,"These stencils do the trick for the $5 it costs. Some of the stencils are a bit repetitive and the same shapes show up more than once. They're a little bit thin, so you have to press down to really anchor it down to trace or else it'll slip on paper. I would have given it a higher rating if not for the horrible smell. I can't even begin to guess WHAT it's from but what it is is atrocious. I'm from a major metropolitan city and even the homeless smell more tolerable. I would return it but the couple of dollars isn't worth the hassle. TBD if lysol gets rid of the smell; if it doesn't, I'm throwing them out since I can smell the stench when walking by the stencils!",73582,3975,3976,0,"It's ok but definitely not high quality! Some of the shapes weren't punched out all the way, some were bad enough they ruined the stencil when I tried to take them out. Some of the shapes are so small you can't fit a pen or pencil in so your freehanding the rest of the shape, which defeats the purpose. Many others had burrs and sharp parts that ripped the marker I was using. The selection of shapes was good but I was disappointed at how many were repeated (2 or 3 Facebook icons, etc).",73583,3976,3977,0,"Disappointed for several reasons. 1. While I received 20 stencils, they are all mostly the same things. It's hearts, stars, circles, ribbons, and banners on nearly every one of them. I guess they would be cute for journaling, but definitely not for calendar-type planners. I was looking for stencils for my day planner, things I could use for baseball games, doctors appointments, haircuts. There was nothing for sports at all, no bbq grill, no beach waves, no fireworks. So boring. And also, most of the items are too big for a calendar square.2. The stencils are numbered. I got two #9 stencils and no #13. Looking at the picture here on Amazon, it seems #13 had the best stuff on it! When I emailed the company to ask what could be done, they told me to contact Amazon. The only option for me on Amazon was to exchange it for a new order and hope for the best. That would mean I'd have to go out of my way to a UPS store and I'm not going to go to all that trouble for a $6 item that I don't even like. Maybe I would have liked the set more if I'd gotten the #13 stencil, but since that won't send one out, I guess I'll never know. It's a cute idea, just not for me.",73584,3977,3978,1,"Very flimsy and hard to trace with for a couple of reasons. One being they bend and move so you really have to press and hold down hard so you dont mess up. Two, the smaller ones are harder to trace and just don't come out right, if you can manage to trace any. This was my first time buying stencils so maybe I'm being a little harsh but I expected more and for the reasons I gave two stars not to happen. I got what I paid for, lol! I'll keep trying but don't think I'm going to spend money trying to figure out which ones are good on Amazon. So I'll try next purchase in person! I would say thouh 20 stencils for the price, try it and see if your opinion is different from mine. What I dont like, you just might!! The good thing is if you dont like it and we share the same opinion about it and you agree with me, you didnt pay lots of money to check it out for yourself!! Lol! I truly hope this helps!",73585,3978,3979,1,I would not recommend these. Not high quality.

I was so excited when I saw them and when I decided to purchase them. I was excited when I got them and was excited until I used them.

I apologize that the pictures are colors mixed from both the bulk apple barrel sets you can buy on here, but BOTH came matte when pictured showed non matte so will be leaving same review on that one too!!

I weighed the bottles with my kitchen scale, and the heaviest two were 3 3/8 oz. Most of them were around 2 3/4 oz, but a few (like the Bright Yellow) were only 2 1/2 oz. I can't say how heavy the bottles themselves are without paint in them to know if each bottle had at least 2 oz of paint in it, but I'm guessing the lighter ones were lacking.As for the paint itself, I've only used them once for some small detail work.

Little did I know they sell this at Walmart (or at least at the one by me) for 50 cents a bottle. So this set on amazon is way overpriced. Most of the paint was great - nice consistency and coverage. A few colors (red, yellow, and orange) were too thin and watery and I had to replace those. The white was a little chunky and didn't flow very well. I would pour a little into a cup, add a drop or two of water, and the problem was solved. BUT I don't think I should have had to do this. Anyways, I paint rocks and this set was a nice starter but I have added to it a lot since I don't like to mix colors.",73589,3982,3983,0,"This is not water soluable. My gdaughter came over and was painting. She got up a had her art work by her side and it on a new pair of white shorts. Impossible to get color out.

Company should be notified and either make it a washable product or say it is not washable.",73590,3983,3984,0,"The paint was very thin and took multiple coats to get into the pores of the canvas. It reminded me of nail polish. I think it would be satisfactory for beginning artists, and the color variety is excellent;however, I now have an enormous quantity of paints that I find frustrating and worthless. I mixed it with various gel mediums to thicken the paint, but that did not improve the paint enough for me. It still felt dull and streaky. I would purchase it for a niece or other artist not overly concerned with outcome. The price for the quantity is definitely a bargain for this grade of paint.",73591,3984,3985,2,"My middle-schooler compared this pencil sharpener to the Prismacolor Scholar Colored Pencil Sharpener (1774266) that she's been using. (I was going to order another one of those, but the price doubled!). She says this Staedtler one sharpens just as well as the Prismacolor, but that she likes this one because it has a screw top. She says this will be nice, because when it falls on the ground, it won't spill shavings all over. This one, of course, is round, so it can't sit on it's side like the funny-shaped Prismacolor. Due to this design, it may be more prone to rolling off the desk in the first place. But, when it does, the top won't pop off. We'll see how it compares over the course of this term. The Prismacolor has kept it's sharpening ability longer than all the others near this price-point that we've tried. So, we'll if this one does, too.Update 2/5/15: After less than a month of actual use, my student came up to me and said ""Look at what this sharpener did to my pencils."" It munched an entire box of her colored pencils. I can't believe she kept trying after it did this to even one! This Staedtler has lost it's edge, and is useless as a sharpener now. I've downgraded the stars from 5 to 1, and we'll be going back to the Prismacolor. It's too bad, because she liked the screw top that kept the shavings in place until emptied.",73592,3985,3986,1,"This product is complete waste of money, it distorts and unevenly sharpens and is difficult to even turn your pencil in it.

Made in Germany, I didn't expect a crappy little blade worse than some of the freebies I've gotten with some of my general's charcoal pencils! I thought this would work decent since I buy quality art supplies from this brand and my electric sharpener, which I loved busted out after under a years use, but this was a waste of 4 bucks.

The sharpner broke off from the lid. I was hoping these would be more robust given the brand. The sharpener gets pencils very sharp. Too bad the connection to the lid is weak. Also, I got these for kids to use since they screw on instead of popping open. I wanted to avoid kids spilling the pencil shavings. This does work better than sharpeners that snap open and close, but it only takes a quarter turn or so for the lid to come off.

I used it only once and never again because it did just the opposite: it chewed the pencil up and it had BARELY begun to reach the lead when I removed it. I was NOT a happy camper when I saw this as it wasted a significant length of a quality colored pencil and had not even started to shave the pencil lead to a point.

I placed a pen next to the colored picture for reference as to the size of the colored picture. I am quite disappointed at how much ink was used!

There may be one or two more but because the shades are so close in colour, the variety is actually very very slim. My sister who gave them to me also bought herself a set and she didn't like the colours either. I'm not sure why there are so many positive reviews except that you do get a lot of pens for the money.

Next trip to Home Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer AA batteries and did the same test on them. 8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tester.Oh well, not worth crying about $13 worth of weak batteries.

They recently changed the packaging (and presumably the manufacturer) and now they only last half as long. I tried a pair of Duracell AAs to test my hypothesis and they lasted almost three times as long. I wanted to stop buying these Amazon batteries, but it turns out that, at around $0.25 each and $0.90 for Duracell, they're still cheaper overall than buying name brand. However, it is extremely disappointing to watch them deliberately drop the quality and force us to purchase batteries more frequently. They've basically pulled a bait-and-switch with us, sucking us in with high quality batteries and then trading them out for lemons without dropping the price commensurately. Their packaging may be frustration-free, but these batteries sure aren't.",73600,3998,3999,2,"I bought this item twice. The first time I was so disappointed at the poor quality I thought there must have been some kind of fluke at the warehouse. The level of power in these batteries was so low that they went dead extremely quickly. Because I have been a very happy Amazon customer for many years I concluded that a batch must have been misplaced in the warehouse and left so long they lost their power. So I bought a bulk batch again. This time the power level was so low that there were multiple times that I put new batteries in a remote control and they were dead when I put them in. And no, they were not stored at my house and lost their power. This happened within the first few months after the batteries were delivered.

Maybe they flatten it out more to put that much on the roll but whatever it is it seems closer to the double ply. One last thing, this is about 90% of the paper of the old double roll 48 pack at the same price so when it was changed it allows them to reduce their shipping costs, lower their manufacturing costs and lower what quantity they give us all at the same price as the 48 count double roll.

A double roll from a 6 equals 12 pack weighs 117 grams less the 5 gram core we get 112 grams of paper on those rolls. Then I took a Supreme roll from a 8 equals 30 pack. It weighs 159 grams less the 5 gram core we get 154 grams of paper on those rolls. Based on what the packaging says the expected weight was 210 grams after the core is deducted. It's official these are garbage, not ultra plush anymore, cost more for what I believe is about 27% less over all paper from what I quickly estimated, meaning we'll use more of it because there is less paper per sheet and we just paid more for it than the past ultra plush version. Complete BS if you ask me. Of course what do you expect from a company that cares about it's bottom line and not yours.....",73622,4024,4025,1,"The tissues themselves are fine, but as some other reviewers have said, the plastic opening to the top of the box is not strong or well-constructed enough. Midway through the use of the tissues, the plastic weakens or rips, causing the tissue that is supposed to be peeking out of the top of the box to fall back in all the way to the stack. You have to put your hand into the box to fish out a tissue, which is not only irritating, but it further weakens and stretches the plastic. So every time you need a tissue, you have to reach down into the box to fish one out. And sometimes you end up grabbing more than what you need, and it's so IRRITATING!

Now, never again. Obviously some bean counter at Clorox/P&G decided it would be a good idea, or maybe just decided they would be a smartash or something and start making these bags a few inches shorter than they used to be. So now, the trash can which used to ""Glad""ly accept the Glad tall kitchen drawstring bags, and then the Glad tall kitchen drawstring with Febreze / odorshield bags when they started making them, no longer likes these bags. I used to never have a problem with them sliding down within the trash can; the bottoms of the bags were just the right distance from the tops of the bags, but these newer ones are way too short. The first heavy item (think an empty pickle jar or soup can) which is placed into the bag is suspended a few inches above the bottom of the can until some more weighty stuff is placed on top. So, Glad Products Company evidently thinks the trashcan should ""squash down"" to compensate for their lack of engineering prowess. Of course, we all know that what will happen instead is that the bag will be pulled from around the rim of the trash can, and then disappear into the abyss, folding up and wadding up in the bottom of the trashcan. Combine this with the fact that I live in the home with two teenagers, and what we have is WAY too dang much trouble than one man should EVER have to deal with in something as banal as a fraggin' TRASH BAG!Oh, and just so the bean counters know... due to this, we will also be switching to some other brand of sandwich and freezer bags, as well as cling wrap.Fool me once, shame on you....",73628,4032,4033,2,"This is how many bags (10) that it took to find one with a solid bottom.

I just noticed today that the sponges are leaking blue dye. I tried 3 different, new sponges from the package and all of them leaked blue dye. My sink is white and I have new dishes that are white, so the blue color is much more noticeable than if I had a stainless steel sink.I researched the issue online and have found dozens of people who have experienced the same thing with all different colors of sponges. I also saw multiple responses from Scotch Brite representatives that stated the dyes are not harmful. Companies like using that phrase, ""not harmful."" Is that really what a worried consumer wants to hear from a billion dollar corporation? Didn't tobacco companies use that phrase?If you have these sponges, you should test them out by applying dish soap, wetting the sponge and then squeezing out the suds into the sink. If you have a stainless steel sink, squeeze out the suds onto a white dish or bowl so it's easier to see the contrast in color.This is my first experience with the blue dye, but it is enough to get me to find an alternative. It's becoming more frequent that I have to find alternatives to the ""major brands."" Their materials are getting cheaper and their concern for consumer safety is following suit.",73630,4035,4036,2,"I too have been using the blue Scotch Brite sponges for years, buying them in an eighteen-pack at a well-known big box store. They were a dependable product, lasting about two weeks per sponge on average, holding up well for our family of two, so not heavy use. 3M has recently changed the sponge, and for the worse. I still have several of the original sponges, as well as some of the newer sponges I purchased in Oct/Nov of 2017. I am comparing the two, still in their clear wrap, as I write.Objectively, the new sponge is roughly 20% thinner than the original and the sponge is a little deeper blue in color. I have not experienced any blue leaching that some reviewers have noted. What I have also experienced is that the new sponges do not hold up nearly as well: They lose their structural firmness, or integrity, after 4-5 uses, again for a two member family. They no longer spring back as you would expect a sponge to do, easily crushing flat, with a consistency closer to a dish cloth at this point, and not holding nearly as much water/soap, requiring more frequent refreshing of same. Before much time passes, a couple days, the sponges begin to breaking apart. Speaking generously, the new sponge lasts at best a week, or half as long as the original, and the use of the product is not pleasant to use. What especially annoys me is the package that states, ""Lasts 50% Longer."" What chutzpah!To be fair, the company did increase the package count from 18 to 21. This does not really improve the mathematics for good value. WhenI bought the old sponges, lasting two weeks, I could expect to buy more after 36 weeks or so. Now even with 21 new-style sponges, needing to replace one after only one week, I am obligated to obtain another package after 21 weeks. Fairly obvious I need to replace much sooner and have to spend more cash over time to keep myself stocked. A much worse deal for this consumer. I think 3M saved money on the actual production of the newer, and in my opinion inferior sponges, while the buyer also has to shell out more to the company, since they don't last.I will no longer buy them.

Something has definitely changed in the quality of these sponges in my two recent orders. In a prior order, the sponges were wet when I took them out of their packaging and when placed in the dish water in the sink, there was blue dye that came out of them with a funky smell. The order I recently received, the texture of the sponges was totally different from the usual Scotch-Brite brand. The sponges are much thinner also. I'm very leery of buying any more of this type of sponge through Amazon in the future as it seems these are knock-off sponges. I don't like them at all.",73632,4038,4039,1,"I thought these Scotch-Brite sponges would be a safe purchase because I frequently buy the same brand from the grocery store. But these sponges were totally different from the ones at the store. They were much more poorly made. They bled copious amounts of blue dye, not just on first use, but throughout their lifetime. That can't be healthy. They also showed wear more quickly than the grocery store variety. I still don't know what happened: the vendor looks legit, but the sponges feel like Chinese knock-offs.

Because of the difficulty, we end up overextending the drawstrings, so we have to double-bag every time just to get the bag of garbage out to the dumpster.

Yeah, they rip and tear if you aren't super careful. Honestly, all the 4 and 5 star reviews must be fake (unless they are storing tissue paper and cotton balls).

Might as well give it a shot right? Yeah, this thing reminds me of one those toy janitor sets. It's just so small and cheap. Judging by the pictures, it looks like the mop handle is supposed to have 3 segments to extend. I was only able to extend 2. I thought about taking channel locks to the thing in order get that supposed third segment unstuck, but I figured I was going to return any way; thus, I didn't want to damage it.Regardless, the mop head is laughably small. It has about a third of the material that you'd find on the typical household mop. Once again, I was planning on returning it, so I did not test how well the head actually cleaned; however, I remain rather skeptical.Oh, and I'm not an expert on such things, but I suspect that the picture of the lady using the product either featured a really tiny girl, or a bit of photoshop, in order to make the product look bigger. The size difference may not be as egregious, but it reminds me of those pictures of kiddy pools you sometimes see floating around social media. You know, the one's where the box art makes the product look huge, but it's actually really tiny.Taking a closer look at the reviews, other people seem to be complaining about the mop wringer breaking as well. All the gears for that look solid enough; so I don't know if the plastic is rather brittle, or if they thickened it up with a later revision. Regardless, plastic mechanical parts typically aren't known for having long mean times between failures, and people are reporting that it is a point of failure. So, consider it another reason to shy away from the product -especially since I could find no information about a warranty on Amazon nor O-Cedar's website.And finally, after being surprised at how dinky the thing was, I decided to take a look at what people had actually written, and saw a review with someone mentioning ""Fakespot"", which is a site meant to identify fake reviews. Well hell, I've got to check this out. Looks, like old Fakespot says that the aggregate reviews have an ""A"" grade, but it also indicates that Amazon removed about 2,000 reviews on two separate occasions. Now, I don't know why Amazon decided to purge nearly 4k reviews, but all of this stuff makes me strongly suspect a fair bit of review astroturfing.Needless to say, I will be returning this dinky piece of garbage. Moreover, the thing makes me think that the O-Cedar business model is all about selling garbage to consumers, and hoping that a minimal amount will be bothered to return it. Stay away from the mop. Stay away from the O-Cedar brand.",73650,4057,4058,2,When I tried to use this item I found that the handle was broken inside and was in 3 pieces. The step on handle that works the spinner was also broken. Didn't find this out until I had the bucket filled and the wet mop head in the spinner.

I am out almost $30 on a product I can't use because it is broken beyond the ability to use it at all. I guess if I got down on my hands and knees and just used the mop head and wrung it out by hand using their bucket I could use it. Very much defeats the purpose that I bought it for though. I would not order this again.,73651,4058,4059,1,"I purchased this product based on what seemed like majority positive reviews and this being an ""Amazon's Choice"" product. It did not live up to expectations.The mop head as pictured is much more substantial than the one actually received (I even made the mistake of ordering additional heads with my bundled purchase). The mop head received was dinky. Fair for light household use in smaller spaces, but not effective for larger or tougher cleaning jobs. It also feels like it is sized for use by a child, not an adult.I also found it difficult to adequately spin the mop head; no matter how much I spun it (think ""salad spinner for a mop""), the head was still really, really wet, to sopping...not good for wood floors!I also washed the mop head after first use. It came out looking nothing like it had been ""refreshed"" or new again. But it did hold up to a machine washing, which I was sort of skeptical about (since the strings don't really feel very microfiber cloth-like, but more like super heavy duty paper).Ultimately, it seems like it's most useful for light jobs, or as a really pricey floor/wall/ceiling duster if used dry. The bucket itself is a manageable size for carrying, so I will probably use for other purposes. And the spinner feature--if it holds up--might be okay for ""wringing"" out hand cloths...?I would suggest a different product for your mopping needs.

Fix it and I may consider coming back.I was initially going with 2 stars, but going with 1 star since feedback to try and help improve the product apparently falls on deaf ears.",73657,4064,4065,0,"*** updated review ***These are worse than I thought. I used them to wash the car today. These microfibers are among some of the worst that I have ever used (I've been buying microfibers for about 10 years). When using soap, these barely lather up at all, because they are so skimpy (they apparently have fewer fibers than higher-quality microfibers. They also do a poor job of buffing. Horrible, horrible quality. Not worth the purchase at all.Original review:I'm almost always happy with AmazonBasics products, but these are the exception. They are relatively small and fairly thin. In particular, check out costco before buying these! The ones at my local costco are much, much better.",73658,4065,4066,0,Very disappointed as this makes 2 out of 2 amazon basics purchases which have been terrible quality for prices that aren't that great. These cloths have almost none of that microfiber gripping when you brush it across your fingers. I have some left over unused Zwipes brand microfibers from amazon that blow these away for microfiber grip. These weigh in at 30g each on my postal scale while the Zwipes are 33g and you can feel it in thickness. The Zwipes are also 80% cotton instead of these which are 90% cotton and its well known across the internet that 80% is the sweet spot for a quality microfiber. I don't understand all the positive reviews on here for these cloths when there is a superior product at the same price available on amazon.,73659,4066,4067,1,"IÂ’m a loyal Amazon customer but not of these towels, when I did a search on auto detail microfiber towels these came up so I bought them.

Buy them at Walmart the brand is Auto Drive 14x14 only $10.00 for a pack of 30, the loops are way longer and softer, they donÂ’t have a tag so I donÂ’t have to rip a tag every time I use one and the best part on these towels is no edge thatÂ’s right no hard edges for a swirl free waxing or polishing. So Amazon can you please remove these towels under the auto detail search and on the description write not for auto detailing, thank you.",73660,4067,4068,0,"These have no substance, way too thin for me. Clearly many out there like them, more power to you. But if you are used to a thick microfiber towel these aren't for you.

I love amazon, have many things amazon in my home from Echo (Alexa) to Kindle Fire, Amazon Basics shredder (Awesome) but these were a disappointment for ME. My first thought for these was the garbage can, would have been easier but I decided to donate the whole package of cloths to the ""Good Will"" instead.

I used the large brush over 3/4 of the shower with two difference cleaners and asked my husband to come in to see if he could tell where I cleaned.He literally chose the only corner that I had not cleaned as looking the cleanest.I scrubbed this shower for more than an hour. I presoaked it with my regular cleaner before taking the drill brush to it. I tried different speeds and pressures to see if there was any way to make this brush work.Nope.I gave up and scrubbed shower walls with a 10cent sponge. The sponge did a better job.",73663,4070,4071,0,"Â It is so out of balance it is hard to hold on to. A very good example of everything out of China, and I was going to fix this myself but at some point the manufacturers have to be held accountable for the zero quality control they they give us. Amazon and China have made the numbers in sales high enough for the both of them to take the returns for poor quality acceptable to the bottom line. In other words the manufacturers have no incentive to make quality products, they simply do not have to so why would they. The Soviets's for years were the best example of why the free market works, my favorite Russian proverb was, ""As long as you pretend to pay me, I will pretend to work."" This does not apply to China's manufacturing, we tend to view China as a Free Trade entity, it is not. It is totally government controlled. They even have entire Cities built to perfectly mimic middle america so the American buyers and manufacturers can feel at home and comfortable. That is not Free Trade, that is no different than a military special ops program in a war. And all of this for a seemingly innocent little scrub brush. Look at a market of one billion or more customers world wide, with manufacturers that have no environmental, no workers unions, nothing even close to the restrictions that our companies have to live by. This seemingly innocent brush is a bullet in a war between countries. All we can do is keep sending them back and hope the next purchase will work as stated.",73664,4071,4072,0,"I got the heavy duty version because my pool tiles at the water line were pretty dirty. I was able to clean them by hand with the pool brush but it was very slow, time consuming and labor intensive.

I ripped open the box the second it arrived, attached to my 20v Dewalt, grabbed some cleaner and...NOTHING! I tried all 3 brushes and each was just as terrible as the other. The grout got clean pretty quick but the tiles didnÂ’t almost at all. It was a huge disappointment. I had such high hopes. I donÂ’t really have another use for these now so I feel like it was a waste of my money. How do these have such good reviews? Are people just cleaning up simple stains? My pool brush with just me operating it by hand and no pole works WAY better than a drill operated brush! How is that? There must be a stronger model than this thatÂ’s actually Â“heavy dutyÂ”!

Strike 3- I only used this product for 15 minutes before I gave up and the top was already smashed down so really no need to try to use it again. I ended up getting my old scrub brush out and cleaned the shower stall. Wish I had read a review like this before I wasted my time and money.",73666,4073,4074,0,Not what I expected. Not as easy to use as videos demonstrating product use. It is awkward to use versus conventional tools and brushes. The brushes are attached to a drill which is normally meant to be stationary for drilling holes or screwing screws. You donÂ’t normally move a drill while using. This brush system requires you to make unnatural movements with a drill while applying pressure for scrubbing. I donÂ’t think drills are designed to be used in this manner. It places weird stress on your wrist hand being used to activate the drill power button. I used the brushes once and would rather scrub with a regular brush than this brush system. I could not find a comfortable way to use the system that did not put twisting stress on my wrist hand pushing the drill power button.,73667,4074,4075,1,"TERRIBLE!

It is the only way that the consumer can keep these battery manufactures honest.

The dead batteries they replaced measure 0.3V. They are supposed to be 1.55V new. Thank goodness for Amazon customer support helping make this right immediately, but stay away from these batteries. I'm sure others have gotten good ones, but it's just not worth the hassle. What to get instead? I don't know, still trying to figure that out because most batteries on here seem to have similar problems in the reviews, but it's an arm and a leg to buy them at your local store.

As many others, I have to use coin operated machines and can't keep the rinse cycle going for that amount of time. Because of that, I feel as though I've only been using blue colored water for all this time.Although Lysol isn't false advertising, they are not providing us with this important information about this product. Most people may not realize that they need to go through this process (or want to, for that matter), but are expecting they've killed all of the germs in their laundry (well actually...unknowingly they may have...if they used hot water... thus eliminating the need to use this product entirely). I mean, I was that person for quite awhile. It makes me angry that another big corporation took me for a ride, and I've paid out alot of my money. I'm also disappointed that I thought my clothes were germ-free, and they were not, because there were many times I didn't use hot water.*******I'd highly discourage others from buying this*******My original review:This is a great product to have and use when doing laundry. If you have a need to rid your clothes and any washable item of germs, and they cannot be bleached, this is a really good alternative. It has a nice clean scent which isn't overpowering at all.For instance, if you've got smelly and sweaty clothes, pets in your home, etc., this is quite invaluable. I actually use mine because I have to wash my clothing in my apartment building's laundry facilities. They honestly aren't super clean and this assures me that I'm not picking up yuck from someone else's stuff (mostly when the person before me overloads the washer). To add to the importance of it, I've got an autoimmune disorder and this double assures me of the germ reducing effect (if you're not able to see yet, I'm a bit of a germaphobe lol).",73673,4081,4082,0,"After using this my husband broke out in a rash that required dr visits and prescription medication to clear up. After speaking with friends learned that the same thing happened with their children. Also, the directions are very specific to ensure product effectiveness and I do not have the time to watch my washer or time the length of rinse cycle so I canÂ’t be sure this even worked to sanitize laundry. Others claim the smell and softness are improved but neither of those show sanitized and the smell is because of the overwhelming chemicals added to fragrance the laundry, not cleanliness.",73674,4083,4084,2,"""Leave in rinse cycle for 16 minutes."" There is no way for me to know how long my rinse cycle is on my HE machine and although it says add to the softener cycle--it says add 2 cupfuls which is more than my softener dispenser can hold.

I was stuck on the other side of the country with a ton of clothes (it is a large suitcase and carried quite a lot of clothes) and no suit case.This is a huge design flaw because the integrity if the 3 suit cases depends on the zipper. But since the handle to carry the luggage is anchored to only one half, it means the zipper has to support the weight of the entire suitcase. This isn't so bad with the 2 smaller bags, but the largest holds a lot of clothes hence a lot of weigh hence the zipper is almost guaranteed to fail very quickly in my case.

The wheels: The 4 tiny wheels are absolutely NOT designed to carry the bulk of this suitcase. While mine haven't completely broken off yet, they are barely hanging... after just 6 weeks of use!2. The size(?): The whole points of the 4 wheels is to be able to roll the suitcase without having to bear any of the weight yourself. This feature is literally impossible with this bag. I have to roll it with two hands, which leads to me tripping on it/kicking it every other step. So then I try rolling it while bent over it, and that just doesn't work either because my back gives out after a while.

I told myself it was fine and despite the price was still the best of others I had chosen from, but WRONG.While traveling from FL to CA and all up and down the CA coast, I realized the poor quality of the materials used. The exterior of the suitcase is great, with a logical design to pockets, sturdy material and stitching, and smooth gliding wheels, but inside it is a different story. The interior BUCKLES ARE CHEAP, the interior LINING AND NETTING ARE CHEAP, and on top of the already FALSELY ADVERTISED COLOR and PRICEY nature of the suitcase itself in comparison to others of similar specs, I was VERY DISAPPOINTED in this product. For the price of this piece I almost just went for the set and I am so glad I didn't.If this was a $50-$75 suitcase from Marshalls or Ross or somewhere I would be fine with it, but having payed $140 I truly expected something of better quality. Honestly just STICK WITH THE AMAZON BASICS SPINNER SET for $120, they're a much better quality and a fraction of the price! Granted the color selection is not as great (which is why I had originally convinced myself to get this one), but they really are amazing suitcases worth more than the price Amazon sells them for and definitely better quality than this suitcase.Additionally, despite ScotchGarding the exterior of this suitcase travel transformed the already dingy/dark lavender color of the suitcase to an even nastier looking dirty purple.SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND DO NOT BUY THIS BAG!!",73700,4110,4111,0,I ordered the luggage in May 2018 to use for my Hawaii cruise in September. Then I recently used it on a Bahama cruise. I took my luggage off the ship myself and went to put the handle down to get in the Taxi to the airport and the handle would not go down. We took every thing out of the suitcase and still could not get the handle down. Luckily Delta accepted it that way at checkin. When i got home we forcefully got the handle down and now it won't come up. This is heading out to the trash! What a waste of money.,73701,4111,4112,2,"I needed a carry on for Europe. Our family of 6 embarked on a three week, 6 city adventure. Lots of trains and planes, stairs and cobbled streets in the rain. This bag held up great. I bought this bag because I didnÂ’t want to worry about any size issues and end up having to check my bag. I also wanted a light bag and this bag hit the mark on both of those items. It is verblight weight and the size is perfect! I was able to expand it while I went on the trip and added keepsakes as we traveled. I love the color too! The rollers and zippers are quality and the handle worked perfectly as well. I didnÂ’t get stuck once. It held up nicely, but this thing tipped over ALL-THE-TIME!! I even bought some stones at a market for gifts(quarts, crystals and others), they weighed about 5 lbs and I strategically placed then in the bottom back of the bag with other heaver items like my boots in hopes it would help and still it would tip! It was less times, but it still tipped!! We had a running joke about my bag as a family because it was the only one that did this and it was throughout the trip. I had to make sure it was always leaning against something when I was in the restroom, restaurant or checking my phone for ticket information. I ended up straddling it for moment stops when I had to take my hand off the handle to grab a coffee or water or whatever. As much as I love all the other qualities of the bag, the tipping issue has clouded the positive qualities. I will be shopping for another bag, even though this one is still in good condition. It was inconvenient for all of us.",73702,4112,4113,0,"I read all of the reviews on this prior to purchasing. It IS a great LITTLE carry on and SUPER lightweight. It is NOT 21""x14""x9""...those dimensions include the top and side handles (23"" includes the wheels). The actual size of the case is 19""x13""x8"" (if you include the pouch on the front, then it's 9"" deep. The case is 13.5"" wide at the bottom and 13"" at the top. I've been using Travelpro bags for over 30 years and I rarely check a bag, even if I'm traveling in Europe for 2 weeks. My ""old"" Travelpro is 22""x14""x9"" (actual) and I thought ""so, OK I'll give up an inch"" for the spinner wheels and a lighter weight bag.Had the description accurately reflected the actual size I would never have ordered. This was especially frustrating since the bags were ordered to use for several extended trips in May, June and July. This is a great bag for very limited packing. My husband put a pair of shoes in, and there was barely room for anything else. Needless to say, we used our ""old"" Travelpro bags and these are going back. Hello, Tumi.",73703,4113,4114,0,"I am giving this product a one star because the seam on this luggage separated on the first trip. On the second trip the separation turned into a total blow out epic fail!!! :) By the way I purchased this bag on 6/21/2017. And....for the record I did not over fill this luggage.I submitted an online ticket through Delsey customer service. I was not sent an acknowledgment message via email; even though, during the online process I gave my email address. After two weeks I called in to find out what the status was for my ticket. There was no record and I was advised I have to ship my luggage out of state at my cost (yes my cost) to another company to have it inspected so the ""other company"" can advise me whether it will be covered under warranty or not. If it is not covered I will be advised what the cost of repair is. By the way there is no acknowledgement/tie back to Delsey for the repair. This is now between me and the other company. Delsey Customer Service made no attempt to allow for tracking of the issue........I am now on my own.Did I mention the seam separation started on the first trip.....grrrr...Good Luck Delsey! Can you save me ""the customer"" and change this from a one star to a five star? The ball is in your court. I am sending this down to a repair company in Greenville, SC named Ayers Leather Shop. Spoke to Peyton Ayers. Real nice guy. Hopefully he pulls this out for Delsey.FYI. So far I have spent two and half hours dealing with this that includes going to UPS to ship this article. So far my cost is $35.Stay tuned Amazonians. I will provide more feedback as this plays out. Some companies end up pulling something like this out of the ditch. At this point it feels like a potential nightmare on the horizon.",73704,4115,4116,1,"At first, i was supser excited to get this 29 inch luggage from Delsey. It looks modern, great wheels, handle is well constructed and it looks like one of the more expensive cases but the truth it's made of a cheap plastic mold. After only 6 segments, 3 trips the suitcase cracked on the bottom and up the side (See pics). I've had the suitcase for less than 8 months.The worst part is that this luggage has a 2 year warranty which is absolutely worthless if it doesnt cover the actualy plastic case Here is what the seller said, ""The manufacturers warranty usually only covers defects. For instance if the stitching is coming apart, the zipper is not working or the handle is stuck. In these cases your item would be repaired, not replaced. Damage such as wearing down of the plastic wheels or a crack in the plastic is usually caused by outside forces and will not be covered."" That's complete BS. It's luggage. It's going to be handled and tossed aroud by airline workers. This should not have broken so easilty.I paid extra money for a hardshell based on the reviews and the warranty. Dont waste your time on this cheaply made suitcase. Now i'm out all of the money because neither the seller, the manufacturer or Amazon are willing to stand behind the sale. Very disappointing.",73705,4116,4117,1,"We purchased two of these suitcases, having owned Delsey luggage before and having had a good experience with them. We travel a lot and know the wear and tear of the luggage. However in this case we are very disappointed. We are right now in a month long international trip and brought the new luggage with us. After the second flight we took, we noticed scratches on the sides and corners of the bags, but we were not too concerned. After the third flight we took we noticed one of the wheels was broken on one bag, and we had a real difficult time opening the other bag, as the zipper started to break. Needless to say we contacted Delsey to tell them of the issue and their response was that when we returned we should take it to a repair shop that they recommend, to see if the problems with the bags is covered under warranty. These are brand new bags that have taken three flights and already have more problems that any bag we have owned before. We plan to take the bags to the shop when we get there, but we are also going to be talking to Amazon about this problem and I will update the review to let you know what the response was from the shop. For now, we advise anyone interested in hard shell suitcases to look elsewhere as these are too delicate for travel. They do look good when you receive them at home though. Very disappointed !",73706,4117,4118,0,"Immediately disappointed on the first leg of our trip when I saw my brand new luggage on the conveyor belt with a gaping hole. I had to travel to 2 countries with a luggage I had to duck tape inside and out. I know the wear and tear of luggages, but I was surprised it was just the first use. Spent a little more than I should thinking it would be sturdier and a brand that was highly reviewed. Unfortunately, my travels lasted more than 30 days beyond the return window. The color was perfect because it was easily visible from afar and was light and easy to maneuver.",73707,4118,4119,0,"I like the size and weight of this bag, but it doesnÂ’t function well. I just returned from a month of travel and am disappointed in the performance of this bag. I didnÂ’t have excessive weight in the bag but it did not roll smoothly. In addition, the telescoping handle would twist, making maneuvering a bit difficult. I will probably just use it for short trips, with limited items, as the plastic, lightweight design can handle very little weight.",73708,4119,4120,2,"Took this bag in the cabin for the first time after I bought it. Pros: Good size, light and easy to carry. Cons: The handle is very flimsy - it has a lot of play, so it becomes very difficult to keep the bag in a straight line when walking. The type of floor doesn't seem to matter. The wheels rotate (too) freely, and if the handle moves just a little bit, the bag goes off in a different direction. Also, the wheels are too small to drag the bag at an angle with just 2 wheels touching the ground. I am not planning to use it as carry-on baggage any longer.",73709,4120,4121,0,"I was very disappointed with this carry on! I was looking for something a little larger than the standard 21"". This piece was advertised at 22"", and it is NOT! Just 21"". Very light material compared to other carry ons also. I taped it, and from the floor to the top is exactly 21"". Seems like misleading advertising. I have never had to return anything to Amazon previously, but will send this carry on back.",73710,4121,4122,0,I was so disappointed with this item. I thought I did my due diligence by reading all the reviews and was looking forward to experiencing all the great things about this little case. The handle is flimsy and the wheels only work on smooth hard surfaces. I carried rather than swiveled through the airport. It did fit in the overhead bin nicely. Cannot speak about capacity as I was very careful not to overload. VERY disappointed.,73711,4122,4123,1,"Extremely disappointing! We ordered 2 of these bags for a trip to Maui and upon the return trip we found one of them had completely split at the seam on the top. We were fortunate to have not lost anything!! My husband glued it with gorilla glue because we were taking another trip shortly thereafter and it seemed to hold well but when we took the 2nd trip, the seam on the other side split!!! The reason I gave 2 stars is because mine seems to be holding up ok so far, but his is just destroyed.

There are black marks on all sides, scuffs, scratches, etc. I tried to remove some of the smudges when we arrived home...no such luck. My piece looks as though I have used it for several years.

During our bus tour around the UK, pieces of the colored coating fell off every time i put it on the bed to open. Part of my routine became wiping them off the coverlet before I got into bed.

Yes, it holds a large amount of items and the wheels, handles, zippers, etc. are great. No doubt about that.My disappointment lies in the quality....I recently flew on a major airline and checked this piece. As this was the first time I used this luggage, it was in mint condition when checked. You can imagine my disappointment when I retrieved it at my destination and it was covered in scratches, black scrapes and nicks and dents. Whereas I realized that airlines aren't very careful with how they handle luggage, it was sad to see that this piece did not hold up better and now looks like trash.",73715,4126,4127,2,"Love the design and the color. It holds a surprising amount and was easy to maneuver through airports and in the aisle of the plane. It's pretty light so lifting it into the overhead bin was easy. I was able to put it in the overhead bin for american airlines and unites without a problem. It held three days worth of clothes, lots of toiletries, a pair of shoes and I still had a lot of room. The handle (that you roll it with) seems flimsy, but held up surprisingly well.The only reason why it's four stars, is because the side with the handle is shallower than the opposite side because of the bars for the pull handle. Since the clothing security strap is on that side, you can't really put your toiletries on that side (or other loose items). The opposite side with the zipper is deeper and would be better for clothes. If the zipper and clothing security strap were switched, it would be perfect.Update: My first time using this as a checked bag and there were TONS of notice scratches and scruffs that donÂ’t come off.

I did not notice it when I first opened the luggage but the cloth liner had a zipper on it that allows you to get to the inside of the luggage outside hard case. When I unzipped that fabric, I instantly smelled a chemical smell...almost like gasoline or some kind of oil smell. Then I checked the ""new product"" tags attached to the handle and much to my concern, it stated: ""WARNING - This product can expose you to chemicals including Di phthalate which is known to the State of California to cause cancer...."" etc. I live in Pennsylvania but that sure doesn't mean MY suitcase does not also include this hazard (so hats off to California for being so responsible, I applaud you!) Needless to say, this luggage is getting returned!!",73717,4128,4129,2,"I only used the bag once for a carry on and did not over pack it.

Not a good value for that price!",73719,4130,4131,0,"Used for one round trip so far. I like it, but there are some design flaws. The trolley pocket feature does not work well to carry the bag on top of a carry on sized wheeled bag (as tour personal item) - this bag will slide off to the side of your luggage and become awkward. I was constantly having to stop walking to straighten it. The inner zip pocket is too small to be useful. I do like that the trolly pocket has a zip pocket. Overall, it was good, but not great. I will up to 4 stars if it holds up under heavy use use.",73720,4132,4133,0,"The photo of this bag leads you to believe that it stands up on its own. It does not. The bottom is soft and the sides have no support. I thought it was a heavier canvass. It might as well be cotton for the amount of ""stiffness"" and hold of the fabric. It's surely roomy enough, but because the fabric has no support, it's a pain to have to dig around to find things. The bag itself is very pretty - and it's roomy, but the strap is cheap.

I thought they just needed to air out. My husband threw the packaging away before I could protest. I wiped them down with a damp cloth, and had them airing the garage for over a month. We even aired them on our patio for a while. When we brought them in side to pack before our trip, it smelled up the entire upstairs and it became very obvious that we could NOT be trapped in a hotel room with these things. So we managed without them.

Perfect for a personal bag while flying. Seems to be able to hold quite a bit of things in it.... but I just CANT GET PAST THE HORRIBLE SMELL. It is so strong that I will probably be returning it & I hate that because it could have been the perfect bag. I am scared to try to wash it to get the smell out because then it will not be returnable. Any advice would be appreciated because I really had high hopes for the bag.,73744,4159,4160,0,I used the tote for one flight and will never use it again. It's a lightweight tote with absolutely NO interior support for the sides; I had to continually readjust my items in the bag to attempt to balance it so it would not tip while rolling. It's perfect as a duffle and fits a ton of stuff in it- except the wheels don't fold in. The tote fit easily under the airplane seat and I love the color however the frustration of having to drag my rolling bag all of the way across LAX like a dog being drug on a leash was a deal breaker.,73745,4160,4161,1,"I bought this bag because it had four wheels instead of just two. I thought it would be great for travel and I had a big trip coming up. Also, it was on the smaller side so I figured it'd be great for overhead on the plane. Compact is great. I packed it up and off we went. We got to our destination and when I grabbed the straps to put it in the rental car, it just slipped right off. Cute bag but this is not a good brand. I have a large hard-sided suitcase in the same brand and it also fell apart (the interior) during the first packing. On a positive note, the wheels rolled very smoothly. Too late for me to get a refund, unfortunately.

It could not accommodate my laptop which is in 13.25 in width, 9 in length and 7/8 in depth in the main cavity. It had two other compartments on the side of the tote which could be used for wallet, smart device, small water bottle, etc. It did not roll smoothly (jerked a lot) over all surfaces. It also fell very easily especially when the handle was extended. The positive features included it was very, very lightweight and east to lift.I tested four rolling totes for about 3 weeks each. I found the Tumi Voyageur Oslo 4-Wheel Compact Carry-On worked overall best for me. It had everything: organization (6 sections - laptop sleeve, hidden compartment that I sometimes cannot find, pens/pencils/smartphone/ruler compartment and two sealed compartments for clothes and shoes), lightweight, small size, rolled very easily, lifted easily It cost more but I kept the Tumi rolling tote and have used it for local travel including on weekly bus trips and also took on the plane last week with me. It can easily lay under the seat in front of you but not the aisle seat which is too small for anything but a purse or folded coat.This luggage didn't work for me because of the laptop size, difficulty to roll, and instability but it may work for you.",73747,4162,4163,0,"Love the bag and it fits under the airplane seat.

But the telescopic or retracting handle did not work consistently. It would not stay locked and was annoying when it kept collapsing. Also I could not use the strap to attach to my larger suitcase as the design at the back of the bag is too tall and therefore when I tried to slip it over my larger suitcase handle there wasn't enough space to pull my larger suitcase as the smaller bag kept crushing my fingers as there is not enough space between the handle on my suitcase and the top of the carry on (hard to explain).

By this month (June 2019) the wheels finally gave out and the fabric above it ripped, causing it to be impossible to be rolled.Honestly I always found it a little inconvenient to roll anyway.

Lots of room, holds a lot of stuff. Side pockets, 2 on each side are handy and spacious. Very light weight. Fits into airline overhead.Negatives: Flimsy, especially the zippers. Not all that stable when pulling on wheels. Wheels are not on the outside so narrow wheelbase causes it to tow a bit erratically.

It is the perfect carry on size and was going to make his travel so much easier.

I would have been fine if it just wiped off, but it didn't seem to come off with simple rubbing. When packing for the return flight, we ended up having to check all 3 bags because the zippers didn't look strong enough to pack any single bag with extra items in it, but even after making sure we didn't over-stuff any single bag, the zipper seam had ripped by the time we got our bag back in the states. I wanted to love this suitcase set, but they should be made to last more than one trip!",73763,4179,4180,0,"Overall this suitcase seems well made EXCEPT for the handle. I just used it for the first time and the handle is not only really wobbly but it doesn't lock when you only extend it half way and it's difficult to retract from full height. Additionally, it gets stuck going in and out if your suitcase is packed semi tight or tight. I might think this was a fluke but realized after purchasing that this is the same suitcase that my husband has had to replace the handle twice on and finally tossed it recently after only a year or two of light use.

Not only did the zipper corrode, two wheels also ""froze"" up (no it didn't get wet) and the piping decided to fray. I cant believe it as I've owned a Swiss briefcase in the past and it was top shelf in both quality and durability. Of course i didn't buy the protection plan and nothing can be done about it now, just warning anyone else from making the mistake of wasting good money on this. With all the negative reviews, you would think this would have been addressed by the company.",73765,4181,4182,0,"Purchased this in March and it has only seen light use. Probably 3 RT Flights and a handful of car trips. Total, under 10. However, one of the wheels de laminated from the spindle (see picture) causing it to now drag and stop the wheel when the softer rubber part of the wheel either spins off the spindle or pulls off and seizes the wheel entirely. See picture. I contracted Warranty Return and I have to ship this on my own dime to have it assessed/fixed or replaced. The shipping cost is prohibitive and I believe this policy and lack of authorized repair centers are designed to be a deterrent for warranty replacement or repair. Especially for a model at this price point. Therefore, all things considered, this is not a worthwhile product nor workmanship and unless it's an expensive piece. If the piece fails, as it did with me, the cost of warranty repair or replacement shipping will likely not justify the effort.",73766,4182,4183,1,I bought a similar one 10 years ago and I've traveled the world with it. It was starting to break down so I purchased this bc they're the same brand and size. I've only had it a few months and taken two trips and it's looking bad.

I will exchange via amazon ad try again but agree it should be built better - although it looks fantastic. The jury is out on the clamshell design vs. just a zippered top. I love the looks and I will give it another try and if needed will just go back to my zero Haliburton tin can - it's 20 years old and indestructible.March 2017 update - Well - I received a replacement and now on the second trip with it the handle fails to retract half the time the button needs to be depressed repeatedly for it to collapse. At the end of the day a great looking suitcase but quality is horrible.,73768,4184,4185,0,"I regret buying this bag. I like the clamshell design and mesh pockets. Overall, good design, but the materials aren't well thought out. I travel every week and the front of the bag is already showing scuffs from typical airline use of going into the overhead. The metal for the handles on the back of the bag is scratched and sharp from dragging over stairs and curbs. Now, one of the wheels (which were initially so quiet) is clicking loudly and creating an embarassing noise as I go through the airport. I had a Samsonite bag from Costco for 1/3 of the price before... it lasted five years. I'm not expecting that I'm going to get five months out of this bag at this rate.",73769,4185,4186,0,"UPDATE: Great marketing, poor product. This bag actually lasted us about three trips before the corners developed scuffs and holes. I have had other recent trouble with Timbuk2 quality (on the Command bag), so I believe this company, while innovative with cool marketing), need to spend more time and money on quality. The other problem that has developed is the handle jams when retracting it. We have had to struggle with manually pushing in the stop tabs. Innovative features are great, but don't matter if the bag does not last. Finally, customer service isn't so great. They respond all cute and cavalier-like, but pictures won't do. They want you to send the bag to them (at your expense) so they can take a look and tell you whether or not they will charge you for the fix. I was once a Timbuk2 fan, bit no more for me.-------This bag has large roller blade wheels that make it easy to travel with as a carry-on. Its stable when loaded, so we did not have trouble with the bag falling forward. There are two pockets on the front, one for a 13"" laptop (or some papers and a binder), and the other for chargers or possibly for your liquids. The bag opens up to two compartments separate by mesh. The compartment on the back of the bag is a full compartment covered with zippered mesh. Great for keeping things together. The compartment on the front side of the bag has a full compartment (Accessible from outside the bag as mentioned later), but also has two smaller mesh compartments for socks, chargers, etc. Another great feature is that when the bag is closed, you can still access the large interior front compartment via a pair of zippers hidden under a lip on the outside of the bag. Great idea to be able to access a portion of the inside storage so easily.",73770,4186,4187,0,"Typical Timbuk2 excellent design and execution, is disappointingly -- or deceptively? -- not sized as indicated. The Medium's measurements are shown on the website to be measured from floor to top of handle, which is the correct way to measure (e.g., from United's website: ""The maximum dimensions for a carry-on bag are 9 inches x 14 inches x 22 inches (22 cm x 35 cm x 56 cm), including handles and wheels.""). However, when measured properly, this bag measures just over 23"" -- that is, it's not in compliance. The bag was not measured by Timbuk2 including handles and wheels, even though the graphics on their site seem to show that it was -- instead, the measurements are for the bag only. If you get this bag for domestic travel, you might be forced to check it (for that matter, if you get the small for international travel, it's not in compliance either). Timbuk2 is far from alone in using deceptive measurements, the majority of bagmakers seem to do the same.",73771,4187,4188,0,"This bag looks great and the reviews are consistently good; which, after much research and consideration led me to purchase it. However, my first impression upon receiving this bag was that the design is lacking in several main areas. As a mechanical engineer I am very picky when it comes to design and build quality. One of the main reasons I purchased this bag was because of the robust looking, external telescopic handle and skateboard wheels. Awesome concept but the design and build quality really let me down. This was apparent upon my first time using this bag. The release mechanism inside the tubes is not supported well and therefore rattles around when you're rolling on anything rougher than a polished airport floor. The rattling is amplified by the tubes and it is utterly annoying especially for a bag that you just dropped $200+ on. I tried to contact Timbuk2 on their customer support line but after three failed attempts just gave up. Fast forward 10 months later while on a trip to Europe rattling down the streets of Dubrovnik the telescopic tube assembly fails completely; pulling apart at one of the joints. The release mechanism was giving some problems in the previous weeks randomly jamming open.. which didn't surprise me given how loose the internals seem to be. When the thing finally broke I had to resort to tying a scarf around the handle and pulling it around.. for two weeks more!! The other main complaint I have about this bag is that the corners are not sufficiently protected. It would have been easy to mount some plastic corner plates on the bottom half but they didn't do it and trust me, it will get frayed and scuffed on your first trip outside of a car trunk.",73772,4188,4189,1,"I ordered two of these for me and my son because United Airlines is super picky about their carry-on luggage policy and economy ticket holders cannot bring a full-size carry-on on board. These are the PERFECT size for passengers who must store their bag under the seat in front of them. HOWEVER, these are very cheaply made and the long strap on BOTH bags lasted ONE DAY before ripping off. Totally bummed. Spent the rest of our vacation just using the short handles. It is nice to be able to lock the piece (for luggage storage at hotel)... but don't waste your money if you're wanting to use the shoulder straps.",73773,4189,4190,1,"I bought the two pack of these, one for myself and one for my wife. They hold quite a lot and fit under the airplane seat very well. When we got to the airport and my wife picked hers up by the handle and put the strap over her shoulder. The strap immediately broke where it was poorly sewn to the bag and her bag fell on the ground. I had a camera in my bag and didnÂ’t trust the strap after that. The bags are made of very lightweight material so they donÂ’t hold their shape when you set them down on the bottom. The zipper on mine felt like it was going to fail. It did not move easily. Unless you are broke you should not buy this.",73774,4190,4191,0,"REVISED- I wrote my previous review BEFORE traveling. On my first day of travel, after about 30 minutes of carrying it by the long strap over my shoulder the strap broke! Ripped completely from its seam. Then a couple of days into the trip the other bag broke the exact same way. Also, a few days into our trip I noticed the inside liner that divided the outside pocket from the rest was also separating from the top seam. The bags are garbage and a huge waste of money.Previous review-After trying to squeeze souvenirs in my purse for a return flight recently I decided it was time to maximize my carryon space. This was a great deal at 2 for $22. Bags are spacious..fully open on the inside with one outside pocket. Exactly what I was looking for!

Yes, the bags are strong and do their job well. But dear God, the smell!

I worried about hurting her, damaging her spirit, etc, but I can see that this is going to bring out the very best in her.Update: I've had this less than a week and the remote stopped working unless it is plugged into the charger. Neither the display screen nor the buttons work unless it is plugged into the charger. All attempts to contact DogCare have been in vain. So for that, I have dropped the rating from a full 5 stars to 1.",73783,4199,4200,0,"Update: This worked great until the shock prongs completely broke right off. When I purchased it, they said if I gave a good review, I'd be sent an additional collar. I did, they sent it. BUT apparently my remote won't work with it and I need the new updated remote. What a headache.......................I've been using this collar for 2 weeks now and love it. Our past collars never worked well and always seemed cheaply made. Not this one. The remote is easy to understand and I love the battery life indicators. I've barely had to use the shocker because my dog reacts great to the beep. It must be just the right pitch to bother him enough to listen. Everything about the collar and remote is nice and sturdy (our dog broke the last one). I can't see him being able to break this one. I use it on a 60lb. Dalmatian and the shock on only 25 seems to be enough, I could see turning it up just a bit if he really wasn't listening.",73784,4200,4201,1,"I originally was super happy with the product, the instructions are very straight forward and clear and the collar easy to use......BUT !product details indicate 15 days stand by time for the reciever to hold charge ,manual says 40 daysand real life proves its only 5 days !!dont fall for this garbage this is all out the box !!!PLUS !to add insult to the mugging, i dont even have a month with the product and its already defective, it fails to respond many times, and the beep stays stuck , thankfully its not the vibration or shock that stays stuck....

I was specifically looking for an ecollar for small dogs and this ecollar come up on my search as highly rated. First off the product is way to big for a small dog. The remote is big and cumbersome. My dog didn't respond much to the sound and vibration. I tasted the shock on myself and it was fine. The product was set to 30 shock rate out of 100...I lowered it to 26. I put the cap on the prongs and my dog wasn't responding. I took the cap off the prongs and at level 26, my dog yelped like I have never heard yelped before. This device hurt my dog.

These don't have this option and my pets won't use them. I spent more time cleaning up and purchasing enzyme remover- which ended up costing me a lot more in the long run by trying to save money with them. Hoping AMAZON will consider adding scent to these and making them thicker, stronger to actually capture urine instead of directing it to go in all directions creating a greater mess than any pad I've ever used in 23 years!: (.",73787,4204,4205,2,"So I came across these heavy duty training pads and thought they would work great for my two puppies. I have been using the Amazon Basics carbon puppy pads and liked those so I figured these would be even better.Spoiler alert, they were not. When I first opened the package I managed to tear the backing of one of the pads by barely catching it on my finger nail. I do not have sharp or long nails.The plastic backing is a little bit thicker and more rubbery than the regular pads from amazon and the filling is thicker.But, simply put, they do not work. Normally I'll leave 6 pads down for the dogs since they are inside for the day, normally those are more than enough and there are no issues with pee running off the pads or anything like that.With the ""heavy duty"" pads the pee just runs off the pad and goes EVERYWHERE. After half a day the pads are soaked both front and back and there is pee everywhere you don't want it to be.I'll go back to the carbon amazon basic pads - but buyer beware, these are only a heavy duty pain in the butt.",73788,4205,4206,1,"**UPDATE** They SUCK!I previously left this review ""I use these pads on the balcony so I donÂ’t have to take the pup downstairs in the middle of the night. They are strong and hold a lot of fluid. After a heavy night of rain you see just how much they hold and still donÂ’t tear under puppy claws""The supplier must have changed as these are now worthless and hold as much puppy pee as a sheet of newspaper. Ordered a new box and they came back just as bad. Judging by all the 1 star reviews, which seem to be hidden from the recent reviews, in the last few months I'd say something has changed with this product.",73789,4207,4208,0,"These pads are horrible. I have a small dog, 15 lb. Chiweenie who is 9 years old. He has always used pads, as he is an indoors only dog. I have never had any problems with the brand I used to get at a big box pet store. I saw these on Amazon, and after having good results with the AmazonBasics dog waste bags, I thought I would give them a try since they were a great price. Well, let me tell you it was not worth it at all. Every single day we are cleaning up a giant mess of pee that has literally rolled off of the pad onto the tile floors. At first I thought that my dog was either getting old and a little senile, or just being defiant on purpose. Well, now I realize this is not the case after watching him go on the middle of the pad and it rolling right off. He is not that big to totally soak through this pad, and it seems like the pad doesn't really absorb anything. The liquid rolls right off the edge and under the pad as well. I believe my tile grout is permanently stained. Too bad my return window was just passed. These are going in the trash.",73790,4208,4209,0,"I rarely write reviews but IÂ’ve never been so furious with a product. Wish I did more research, the pressure mounting aspect of the 4 corners means that this thing needs to be real tight to the frame, which wouldnÂ’t be a problem for a doorway or something along those lines. I set mine up at the bottom of the steps, propped between the wall and the last vertical wood slat of my railing.First night the top corner that was positioned against the railing slipped off (round slat, kind of my fault but i figured out a solution). I will say that the other 3 corners remained intact so it's unlikely that it wouldn't have fallen on my kids had they been there when it happened.Day 2 my daughter was hanging on the gate and it opened, despite being locked, which likely was the result of the fact that it loosened my bannister from the stairs, which now appears to be structurally impaired.Adding insult to injury, when i took it down, upon loosening the pressure mounts, the gate smacked me in the face and then, after fully removing all 4 corners, the extension piece fell on my foot.My dog also didn't like this product. He would be real reluctant going up and down, probably the fact that the railing the extends across the bottom basically made the last step unusable for him so he would just skip it coming down and be real funny going up. He has some elbow arthritis though so probably not an issue for younger/smaller dogs but he's an 8 year old 75 lb lab. Would have to imagine some bigger breeds would be really challenged with the width of the opening too.To summarize, i don't recommend for steps at all, top or bottom, unless there's no railing in the picture. Probably a decent product in other settings and it felt very solid when it blasted me in the face. It's going back though and i'll just stick with my standalone gate for now.",73791,4209,4210,2,"I hate this gate. I find it amusing that the mother in the photo is smiling while holding her toddler in one hand and opening the gate with her free hand. WELL, let me please tell you that every time I have to open the gate I get angry, am not smiling and have to put my giant toddler down, on the stairs, while holding him between my legs to use all the muscles in both my hands to open the ridiculous latch. Really? Could they have made it any worse. It is like those adult proof straps on the new shopping carts, but much much worse.Seriously, just spend another 5 or 10 bucks and get a gate that you won't hate every time you see it. ( I ordered 3, but threw out the box and everything right after installing it so I had to keep one and returned the other 2. At least Amazon is super easy to return with.).",73792,4211,4212,1,"This is a terrible gate - easily the worst I've ever had. I got it for my dogs and every aspect of the design is TERRIBLE. When uninstalled the gate constantly swings open. When installing it myself it swung open and smacked my wall causing damage. You'd need to zip tie it closed since for some crazy reason they don't design the gate to actually stay closed before installation..like every other suspension gate I've ever had. That fact alone is ridiculous. But, then you have the spindle rods. You'd think the threaded rods would actually screw into the gate...but they don't! The holes aren't threaded! So if you tilt the gate or try moving it around before installation they'll fall out. Seriously, who designed this piece of garbage?! Only the cheap plastic ""adjustment wheel"" is threaded so that is what holds the gate in. Very unstable design especially if you're at that sweet spot where you can't use extension gate piece and have to extend the rods further out. That's a disaster waiting to happen since the rod is just loosely sitting in the gate. I wouldn't trust this at ALL if you were buying it to keep a child from getting hurt. Last but DEFINITELY not least...who the heck wants to open this thing one handed? Seeing a review where a guy videoed himself opening and closing it was what sealed the deal for me buying this gate. Do not be fooled - it is very uncomfortable to open one handed or otherwise! I've got pretty strong hands but even my fingers were sore after trying to do it multiple times. Save yourself the headache and go with another gate. Whoever designed this had absolutely no consideration for anyone actually using it. It's like they cut every corner and straight up didn't care for the comfort of the person using or installing it.",73793,4213,4214,2,"I have a Maine-Coon cat. Sheds like a sheep-dog. I comb and brush him often. He does not fight or resist me when I brush and comb him. In fact he mostly enjoys it. I bought this brush (which is more like a razor comb) to add to my arsenal of grooming aids. To my surprise, when I tried this on my cat, he quickly resisted. I tried again a day or two later with the same negative response. And tried again after another week with same negative response. I found this to be strange because my cat enjoys being groomed. So, I decided to try it on my the back of my own head to see how it felt. Now I understand why may cat hates it. It just plain hurts. Drag it across your arm youÂ’ll see. I threw it away.",73794,4214,4215,0,"I'll start by saying I got multiple emails from the seller requesting feedback and to email them if I have problems and I haven't emailed them because I want to leave honest feedback instead of being refunded in exchange for not saying something in the reviews. So seller seems motivated and I'm sure they'd refund me if I wanted it.That said, honest review- this doesn't work at all for my cat. It's nicer than a furminator as it doesn't feel like it's ripping hair out. My little gremlin didn't seem to mind it. But, it's just not effective. I get so much more off him with a slicker brush. My guy is an exotic shorthair- basically a short haired Persian. It grabs the undercoat as a comb like this should, but holds and removes very little hair. Slicker brush is way more effective. May work ok for other animal types but no good on my smooshy boy.",73795,4215,4216,0,"I had a similar brush with deeper teeth that worked real well on my cat with Real thick fur and the ones that are short haired. That brush had a wooden handle and the metal falls out of the wooden handle the first season of use. IF the handle of THIS brush was adjustable, I would like it much more. I got the other brush first and just got used to brushing from a straight down angle. This handle gets in the way. This brush also says ONLY USE on Shedding animals. I had to try it, it's new, but, I will use it more when they all start to shed. I ordered another brush of a different kind already, so, I will see how it works.",73796,4216,4217,2,"Did not find this worked well w/our dogs. We noticed some shedding lately even though our dogs are very short hair (2 pit bulls) so have been getting all over our clothes and furniture. its hard to keep up after 2 large dogs even w/ daily vacuuming so wanted some assistance in the shedding department. both sat still for the brush which is actually more like a comb but neither one really liked it. it did not do anything as far as hair removal so perhaps this is better or longer hair pets. we found better results w/the glove type hair removal areas used outside b/c while those do not catch the hair in the gloves w/short hair, they DO work at removal so being outside is helpful so that the hair does not get re deposited inside. have sent this item back. is prob better for long hair.",73797,4217,4218,0,"So I did the thing. I saw a much cheaper alternitive to the aussie grooming holy grail and I fell for it. I read the reviews, most of which were positive, but I should have noticed the lack of double coated dog owners. I ordered the ""long hair"" bursh but the teeth don't penetrate my aussies fur. In order to use this effectivly as a shedding brush I have to use a rake style brush and comb back the hair, parting it oposite the direction of growth and then let the hair come through the rake and brush it out in short strokes with this wannabe furminator. 10 minutes to groom is a pipe dream if your dog has thick fur or is double coated. I thought the first time was a one off because he was dirty. By the third time it was still taking me 30 minutes, and he is a mini! This brush does work well for my red heeler, so it gets two stars for not being a total waste of money, but pretty much every brush on the market works for my heeler so while it is a positive it is nowhere near a win.",73798,4218,4219,2,"We're not 100% sure, but it seems like this toothpaste poisoned our Yorkiepoo.

We tried this out on our dog yesterday after dinner. We didn't use that much and followed all instructions. Since it was the first time, we used not even a pea-sized drop and brushed a few teeth on the top so she could get iaed to it. Around 2:00 am our dog was up and running around with explosive diarrhea. Of course, she ran over to our brand new $800 rug that we've only had for two weeks and let loose on that.It's ruined. Nothing else in her routine changed the previous day and she hadnt eaten anything new, so it had to be this toothpaste. I looked at the box and the first ingredient is sorbitol. When reading about this ingredient, it's not dangerous to dogs like xylitol is, but it can cause diarrhea, flatulence and runny stools in dogs. There is no warning regarding possible diarrhea on the box or tube packaging.As I was trying to get the stains out of our new rug, I browsed around online and saw this was complaint others had made for this toothpaste. How can this company market this as being safe for dogs when it upsets a dog's tummy so badly? I think Amazon should stop selling this as it's clearly unsafe and/or the product does not give approrlpriate warnings. And it would be appropriate for the manufacturer to reach out to me regarding my ruined rug. Of course I understand accidents happen and I take that on as a pet owner. But had there been approproiate warnings like ""May cause stomach upset in some dogs,"" I would have taken more precautions when trying this product out on her.

I bought three tubes and thinking maybe something was wrong with the first one I opened a second one. It smelled just as bad as the first. I then went to my local pet store and bought a smaller size tube of the same flavor (poultry) and it smelled bad like the rest. We had a tiny bit left in the tube we had been using so we did a taste test with our dogs and found they preferred the older tubes flavor over the new stinkier tubes. I went ahead and used the first tube because I needed something to brush my dogs teeth with but they aren't as excited about it as they used to be and towards the end of the tube it began smelling even worse. At this point my husband and I are concerned about the safety of this product for our two dachshunds and are looking into some other brands.

I was very gentle and cautious, realizing this ahead of time, and brushed very gently. When I realized after about 5 strokes that my dog wasnÂ’t enjoying it, I stopped and examined his skin.

He had swallowed it whole. Luckily, the ER team got him to vomit quickly, so crisis averted.

I was really excited to get these but as they say you get what you pay for. Had for one day and had to remove all the squeakers from the pet and they still have the pet (holes included from where the material ripped). Plus side to this is there is no stuffing!

It specifically advertised that it works in ambient light, and it does. My entire house lit up like a Christmas tree.

I took this light first and shined it on the carpet that had been urinated on. The spots were all dry and the light did not illuminate them. I found this odd, but thought maybe the urine will only illuminate if it is wet. Still I scoured our house one night with all the lights off. I shined this light everywhere. In every dark corner where a cat could hide, I made sure there were no glowing urine spots with the light. Come to today, I found a fresh puddle of urine by my front door. I went and grabbed the light......NOTHING. The UV light made the grain in my wood floor stand out, but the cat urine did not react to the light at all. It may as well have been a puddle of water on the floor. This light is not the correct wavelength for detecting urine. So now I must attempt to find a light that will actually do the job.

I thought the X-L ball would be great as my dog is larger and I thought he might like chewing on the larger sized ball. Unfortunately within 30 mins it had already started tearing. I don't know if the larger size is to blame or if I just got a faulty product or what but either way it was very disappointing. That being said I will reiterate that the medium size has lasted almost a year and shows no sign of wearing out anytime soon.

As I continued, each successive stroke seemed to hurt him greatly. I figured that maybe it was just an adjustment issue, so I stopped using it that day and decided to introduce it to him slowly, and with lots of treats to encourage him to tolerate the tool. After a week of slow introduction, I have given up. Even despite my dog's reluctance, I noticed that it was also pulling his hair fairly often. Now, he doesn't have very long hair, nor is it matted at all, so this was troubling.This tool was terrible at serving the purpose I bought it for.

My previous brushes that I've owned that I purchased for double the price at a chain pet store the metal comb still looks brand new despite the amount of brushing it goes through on my Australian Shepherd and Chihuahua. To make sure I wasn't completely overreacting, I went to the same chain pet store I purchased my previous brushes to compare the two through the packaging since I tossed out the packaging for my old brushes a long time ago and can only compare the brushes itself out of the packaging.

As one of the reviewers mentioned the picture of the dog laying on the rug on the packaging is extremely low in resolution. The packaging and font colors looked slightly different from the authentic FURminator brush and packaging. The plastic used on the counterfeit one looked much more poorly made and cheap. The brush cover for the brushes were also two completely differently colors. It's slightly concerning to know that I have purchased a counterfeit product. Thank goodness I did not use them on my pups, who knows if it would have ruined my Aussie or Chihuahua's coat! Or even worse it could've hurt them, especially with all that weird rusting going on in between the metal combs!

And I now use this ""Pet nail grooming tool"" for woodworking.",73839,4265,4266,2,"Having other Dremel rotary tools in my small shop which have performed very well for years, I bought this Dremel-branded rotary tool for nails and small, light polishing work. This was disappointing from the get-go. Tool was always noisy, with a metallic rattly sound that sounded like it was grinding itself to death. Two speeds, ""slow and slower"". Battery was always weak - even after being fully charged it would run the tool for, at most, about 15-20 minutes. Not much torque - would slow down significantly while doing normal doggy-paw nails. Over time, the battery would run the tool for fewer and fewer minutes, until it was under 2 minutes. I looked for replacement batteries, but brand-name batteries were almost as much as a new tool. Since this Dremel 7300 was disappointing from the start, I decided to chuck the whole thing - throw it out. I bought a corded WEN rotary tool as a replacement (WEN 2305 Rotary Tool Kit). I didn't want another under-performing battery-powered tool that locked me into high-priced tool-specific replacement battery. For other users a cord may not be an option; for me, a cord works OK. The WEN does everything this Dremel did, only better. This Dremel left a bad taste - if I didn't have other Dremels (one corded and one battery powered) that have performed well, I wouldn't buy another Dremel.

This tool began having switch problems three months ago. I use it once a month on my mini-lasapoodle so that means I have used it about 16 to 18 times. After approximately 12 times the speed started getting inconsistent. Revving up and then down, then stopping then revving up, now it frightens my dog to use it. Cheap price, but quality not so good. My elderly father has a big dremmel tool that plugs in, which he purchased it probably over 30 years ago, which my sister inherited and still works. This version is not good in quality. The switch goes on and off during use, I have to hold the switch down to get the connection to try to keep the speed consistent. I didn't expect it to last 30 years like my elderly Dad's dremmel, but I didn't expect it to last through only 12 pedicures either. Wish I had bought the plug in Andis version.First review - purchased 12/20/2014: Very nice tool. I think I needed a rougher sand paper because one of my poodle's toenails are like steel. Be careful when you use it that you don't hold it more than a few seconds, because a Dremel heats up the toenail fast. I think this was a good purchase and would recommend you to purchase it. Perhaps including other sand paper grains from light to medium to heavy would be a nice add to make it 5 star.

Usually, they have little aversion to anything that resembles food, but, as soon as they took a sniff of it, each one closed their mouths and turned their head away. As I said before, it smells similar to bananas, so, I thought my dogs would like it since they love bananas and eat them often.

When our most avid chewer gets a hold of anything Nylabone, we have to take it away from her because of her gagging by getting pieces in her mouth & possibly down her throat. We have also had to throw them out after seeing their gums bleed after they get any wear. I truly wish Nylabone would fix this problem. Because our dogs really do love their products.

The second time my dog had a number one accident, however, I made sure to see if it was possible the urine could have leaked off or around the padding, but because the urine was all in the middle of the pad with no wetness towards the edges, I thought that I was good. But as soon as I lifted the pad I noticed my floor was once again soaking wet (not damp, but as if this pad did nothing but just transfer the urine).

The logo that is put in the middle of the 400gr side of the knife is causing more material to be removed than the rest of the blade when I'm sweeping across. I even verified this by going straight down the length of the fine side and watching the wear pattern come from the material coming off of the knife onto the stone.Checking with a surface plate at home and at work I've also verified the edge is not staying straight and curves inward towards the spine before the tip starts, which is where my knife typically stops traveling over the logo.I'm likely just going to throw this stone away.

They are horrible for your knife. They remove way too much metal and just shear metal from the edge of your knife instead of gently grinding it away, leaving you with a ragged edge that doesn't cut worth a damn, and is going to get dull again extremely quickly.In order to sharpen a knife, you must remove steel from the edge. The goal is to create a new apex, thus giving you a sharp cutting edge. The problem with carbide sharpeners is the method by which they remove steel. Carbide sharpeners literally ""cut"" or ""Shear"" steel from the blade and leave the blade in shambles. There are many pictures in sharpening books that show how ragged the edge of a knife blade looks after sharpening with a carbide sharpener. On the other hand, sharpening a blade with a proper sharpening stone gradually ""grinds"" or ""abrades"" steel from the blade and also polishes and refines the edge, resulting in a smooth, polished, longer lasting, and much better performing cutting edge.Carbide sharpeners are only favored in recent times because the vast majority of society are clueless about how to use a traditional sharpening stone.

Then I hand sanded with the remaining pads in the kit, which resulted in a much better final product in about 25% the time. So at this point I'm left with one headlight that looks great, and another that is probably permanently damaged.I thought this kit would be less effort because it used a drill--I was wrong. It starts at 500 grit, which is excessively high and results in wildly inefficient time spent. It is also very easy to overheat the headlight and cause smearing.

This is simply not acceptable so I started comparing brands and this one came out on top! At least at first.Now this latest batch of steel wool (I bought 10 packages) is doing the same thing. Bummer!So back to trying other brands.",73901,4336,4337,0,"I bought this 0000 steel wool to prepare a shellac finish prior to applying wax over a shellac finish. It shed so much lint that it stuck in the body of the wax. Besides looking terrible, the steel lint will turn brown over time as it rusts, making a mess of the finish. I had to strip everything down and start from scratch. No good for finishing fine wood furniture or any woodworking project, really.",73902,4337,4338,1,steel wool is steel wool. this is good quality.

I'm hoping some wax will help but I do NOT recommend this on windows.,73903,4338,4339,0,"I purchased this item to use in conjunction with my current King brand water stone. Needless to say, the bearmoo stone has not met my expectations..... it claims it is a 3000/8000 grit stone. I have not found this to be the case, as my King brand stone is a 1000/6000 and the bearmoo stone's 8000 side feels about the same as the 1000 side on the King stone. If you are like me and are purchasing this to polish a blade, don't waste your money! The King brand 1000/6000 stone does a much better job! I have also compared the grit on the bearmoo stone with brand name Wet/dry sandpaper and found about the same results so it's not just a bias that I like the King stone much better.",73904,4339,4340,2,"If you are new to sharpening and want something quick and easy to learn, this is not it, I've watched countless YouTube videos and tutorials I've tried different angles different techniques, different knives and nothing is able to put a halfway decent edge on a knife with this stone, I purchased the 400/1000 and a 3000/8000 and cannot find desired results, my suggestion is that if you don't have expensive knives (over $200) then buy a cheap 1x30 belt sander with some 400 grit belts and a leather belt (all this was only $20 more than these stones) and you will be much happier, I can get even my cheapest knives to shave hair in under 5 minutes on the belt sander, and I can't even get them to cut paper after hours on these stones.",73905,4341,4342,0,"I bought both the 400/1000 and 3000/8000 combo stones. After many uses and loads of frustration, I could not recommend these to anyone, even if you are on a budget. The Â“8000Â” stone is no where near that grit. If you polish an edge with 2000 grit wet sandpaper, this 8000 stone will take it right off. If you canÂ’t afford a decent stone, buy some wet sandpaper instead. These are not worth the money.",73906,4342,4343,0,"IÂ’m no pro, but have been sharpening my own knives for a couple years using a high-end 1000/3000 Japanese whetstone. My every day knife is a Wusthof Ikon 8Â” chefs knife and I maintain a shavings edge on it. Thought IÂ’d try something finer to see how much better it could get and gave this stone a try because the reviews are favorable and...well, itÂ’s cheap. The 6000 side was so coarse that it raised a fresh burr in a matter of minutes. I think the stone is mis-marked, as it felt and ground like a 400. I mean, thereÂ’s no way I could form a burr like that with a true 6000 stone. Appalled, I started a fresh edge with my trusty 1000/3000 and had a new shaving edge in about 10 minutes.

It appears that the phenolic material that the 3 screws pass through to attach to the sander is thinner than that of the original pad. The screws were tight (even after the pad went flying off the sander) but there must have been some play that allowed the screw threads to eat away at the phenolic plate until the holes became large enough to slip over the screw heads. Rather than order another pad, I guess I'll just get another brand of sander. (I do commend Amazon, however, for their generous and easy return policy.)",73908,4344,4345,1,"I say I use my 332 for a total of less than 5 hours, about 10 minutes average each time over the life time of the tool, and it is still in great condition.

Don't press hard, don't use say less than 300 grid paper etc."" I will not recommend anyone to buy this tool unless you are prepared to spend $18.00 on replacement pads often. Buy some cheap China made sander for less than $20.00 when on sale. !! So what if the 332 unit is very powerful, comfortable to hold and the dust bag design is very good. ...And there is little we can do to fix the issue because over time, the foamy padding material disintegrate and the screws lose their holding power, especially if the tool is kept in a hostile workshop environment (solvents, paints, corroding dust etc.)USA, wake up.... or more U.S. factory people will be out of a job !!However, we must be thankful that Amazon.com still carries this product and discounted price, or else we will have to pay list price from Porter Cable.",73909,4345,4346,0,"The Replacement Pad for a Porter Cable 333 Sander failed after 2 sanding sessions. The Pad does not fit the Sander properly and is of a poor design. The last time I used it, the pad came flying off the sander. Upon investigation, it was determined that the holes on the pad are too large for the screws on the bottom of the sander.

After I paired them with two devices they stopped working correctly. Any type of audio would play for only a second and then stop. I tried everything to get them to work including going back to pairing them with only one device and they never worked correctly again. I called customer support and they worked through a few things and then determined that the sensors on the headphones which mute a call or pause the music when you take them off was interfering with the ability to play audio. Their suggestion was to turn off the sensors. The customer care rep didn't see anything wrong with this option. They were brand new and their fix was to turn off one of the functions in order to get them to work. I told him why I didn't think that was acceptable and he said ""I guess you could look at it that way."" He then said if I wasn't satisfied I'd have to return them. Here is the kicker. If I was within the Amazon 15 day return period (thankfully I was) I could return to Amazon and get a new pair. If I was outside the 15 day Amazon window I could return them to Plantronics and they would replace with a REFURBISHED pair. So they won't replace your headphones with a new pair if they are older than 15 days. This solidified my decision to return them to Amazon and get a different brand of headphones entirely. Also, the customer care dude didn't apologize ONCE for all the trouble. It was as if I was being unreasonable by expecting all functions to work. I don't expect much from customer service operations these days, but this was really beyond par.",73911,4347,4348,2,"I've had the PC 333 for at least 6 years now, never a problem. The foam pad finally peeled apart from the mounting material (Bakelite maybe?) recently so I ordered the replacement from Amazon. After no more than 30 minutes worth of use the new pad fell off the sander. Sure enough, like some reviewers have posted, the 3 screws that are used to mount the pad to the sander rounded out their mounting holes and the pad simply fell off the sander. I'm not sure why they don't use the same original material to mount the pad, like I said it looks like Bakelite but I don't think that stuff is legal/available anymore, but that plastic mounting pad is in perfect shape, it just doesn't have the foam pad on it anymore. It's now on it's way back to Amazon. I think I'll try the DeWalt now.",73912,4348,4349,0,Was working great for about a months time and then the rod bent making it unusable.

I only gave it 2 stars because at least it does SOMETHING.. even if it's not what it was described to be.",73916,4352,4353,0,"This is a ""meh"" holder. The rubber was distorted and uneven so one side of the sanding disc would wear out faster and eventually rip apart. On top of all that it was very unbalanced and after a while of using it my hand was tingly. I forced my company into buying me a good one and it was great. If this is used in a hobby setting it would be great but I use this every day for deburring parts. It's a fantastic price for what it is though.....and could possibly be made better.",73917,4354,4355,1,I didn't have a good experience with this stone. It has jagged side edges that are higher than the sharpening surface of the stone. The stone surface is also not level thus I could never get it to properly sharpen my scandi grind knives. I gave it a fair trial then ended up tossing it in the garbage. It was only a few dollars so I guess I got what I paid for. Can't expect much for that price. Avoid this stone and go for a higher quality one.,73918,4355,4356,1,It goes to say that you get what you pay for. The coarse side is definitely good for blade repair but like some of the other reviews the stone came with raised edges which makes it impossible to use in a reliable way. The fine side however didn't have the previously mentioned problem but it is still a bit to coarse to get that perfect razor sharp edge. I'd suggest spending the extra money and get a higher quality stone from a company that takes more pride in the quality of the products they produce.,73919,4356,4357,0,"I simply cannot get any of my knives to become sharper using this stone. I've tried different techniques, wet, dry, oiled, etc. It just makes sharp knives dull and dull knives remain dull. I can use other stones with reasonable success. I'm stumped why this one fails me. To be fair, it could be user error, but the odds of that are slim.",73920,4357,4358,0,"Mine had a raised 'lip' around the entire perimeter of one of the sides. Hard to describe. But that lip completely prevents you being able to sharpen anything with smooth strokes, as the blade will bump into the lip, and easily put a deny into the blade. The opposite side seems fine, but this company needs to pay better attention to their molding process. This item was like $3, so I didn't bother returning it.",73921,4359,4360,0,"So I bought this sharpener at the local Cabela's because I needed something to sharpen my knives (other than my parents kitchen knife electric sharpener). I've been using this for about 3 days on every knife I own and it won't sharpen a single on of them (in fact, they are duller than they were before I used this sharpener). I am not sure if I am doing it wrong (I'm following the instructions that come with this and have watched instructional videos online on how to use it properly) or maybe the blades on my knives are complete garbage. Either way this sharpener has not been what I expected it to be. There are some positive aspects to this though which are the size, the ability to store it in the handle, and the price. I am gonna look at buying Smith's TRI-6 Arkansas TRI-HONE Sharpening Stones System instead and see if that makes a difference.",73922,4360,4361,0,"I have a hard time finding a use for this.You can't easily repeat an angle with it, so it's difficult to create a sharp edge. It's kind of like using a square honing steel, which files off metal much faster.You also can't get the abrasive surface to lay flat on a work surface, because there's a hard plastic hilt that prevents it from getting level or stable.I think in the average user's hands, it's more likely to ruin the consistency or sharpness of a blade edge than it is to sharpen it. The only thing I can imagine using it for getting a rough edge on an axe or something.The product is exactly as advertised, but in my case a mistake to buy.",73923,4362,4363,0,"This sharpener is not as good as the granite stone I replaced with this. Too bad I threw that rock away already. This is a great sharpener for people who don't like their blades super sharp; for fear they'll cut themselves.

I've plugged it into my charging block which came with my iPad and left it for an hour and when it was time to get up and go, I realized it only charged a couple percentages. Not too long after, it wouldn't even charge, nor would my phone even recognize that it was plugged in. I've used the regular iPhone charging block and nothing happened.

I agree, it's even got the little molded plastic pieces leading up near the end, that if you've done your research you'll know are a sign of grade-A cable design, and hey, it's got the amazon brand on it, so it must be good!Well I'm writing to say, not so fast. You see while this cable seems in every way to be great from a mechanical perspective, something doesn't hold up internally. About three weeks after buying this, mine still looks good enough to put in a museum, but one side of it quit charging my phone yesterday, and now the other causes the screen to flash on and off about 100 times a second.

I notice little, if any difference between a 'loaded' strop and bare. Tried several different blade types. I realize that this is just a fine tuning addition to the strop and that you don't need that much. It just simply didn't make a lot of difference IMO for the blades I tried: Chef knife, slicer, sushi knife, pocket knife. The sharpening is mostly done in the other stages.",73947,4389,4390,0,"I haven't used it yet, so can't comment on quality, but my bar was both smaller than I expected and noticeably smaller than the ones in other reviewers' photos.

The bar seems mass-cut, not just eye-balled and whacked off a larger piece, so it seems likely that others are getting the smaller bar as well.The difference isn't worth having a back-and-forth with the seller about it, but short-changing customers is maybe the first thing to avoid as a seller.",73948,4390,4391,1,"No/Plainte :  4563

Message de plainteÂ :
One side works like magic the other doesnÂ’t work at all.. so your basically paying to use one side since the other side doesnÂ’t actually get used. Unless I was given a faulty product but too lazy to return it and already used the one side. Also difficult to clean I wonÂ’t be able to use it more than three or four times since getting lint or cat hair out is not as easy as all the other reviews are making it sound.
WouldnÂ’t recommend product.",73949,4391,4392,1,"I purchased this product believing it would put a fine finishing hone on my various knife blades as the final step following the use of sharpening stones. When put to the test, it missed the mark considerably leaving my blades with a far duller edge then I obtained with just the use of sharpening stones. Perhaps it was the way I used the product. You tell me....To use the compound I applied a thin layer of it on to a leather strop and stroked the knife blade in a back and forth motion (pulling the knife with the non-blade edge in front) along the length of the strop at approximately a 20% angle. I repeated the process so that both sides of the knife edge had equal strokes. No matter how often I attempted this, the blade would lose its edge and fail the simple paper cut test. In comparison, I found that using the strop without any compound at all worked much better in giving the blade a sharper edge. My advice is stay away from this cheap imitation.",73950,4393,4394,0,"Quit working after 5 months. Buy a different phone system. This phone was purchased December 20,2017. It quit working around the middle of April. I need to return it as I think it should have lasted longer that that. The deadline for the return was in January 31, 2018.

I have reset the handsets and power cycled the base but no change. I am in the proces of trying to find a procedure to hard reset the base but have yet to find one. All I can say is this is a terrific phone when it works, kind of a doorstop when it doesn't.I contacted AT&T customer support and had a very circuitous troubleshooting session that was not addressing the issues I was having with the phone system. Maybe she could not understand what I was trying to tell her, we both had an issue with that, but in the end when she finally determined that the phone would need to be returned she began telling me how to package it, send it via UPS (or other), and when it became obvious to me that there would be no replacement coming BEFORE I sent the broken phone back our talks ended.

I have called then numerous times for assistance, The first time I was told that CC uses ATT cell towers and they were having problems with some towers in my geographic area. I was told to wait 10 days to 2 weeks and call them back if the problem hadn't resolved itself. It didn't....so I called them back. I got another rep who tried numerous things that didn't work. I was told a supervisor would contact me when available to help me resolve the problem. A few days later the supervisor called me back and walked me though the installation process for the phone. Everything was set up correctly. She sent signals that for some unknown reason were not being received by the phone. I still didn't have a dial tone, and I've never gotten a dial tone. She told me she was going to look in to the problem a little more and see if she could come up with anything. I got a call back from them (CC) and was told that the VTech phone was ""not compatible"" with Consumer Cellular's service! Who knows this? i didn't know and neither did CC apparently.

Can someone please help me with this, I would really appreciate it!Thank you.",73957,4400,4401,0,"The phone itself is great, but the ""brand new"" batteries were bad, did not charge in 24 hours, and ran out after a few minutes. After several heated arguments with the phone company (via email) over getting a ""line in use"" message and no dial tone, it sank in that the batteries were useless. I didn't want to return the whole phone, as the next one might be the same way, so I spent much time researching batteries. RESULTS: (1) The batteries that come with the VTech have a short cord that fits easily, while the replacement cord is too long and hard to stuff into the case. (2) Talking to different vendors and comparing ""compatible"" batteries, I learned that several 2.4V batteries will work in this phone: 300, 400, 600, or 750mAh, the difference being the capacity or duration of the charge according to one vendor (I'm not an electrician, so if in doubt do your own research.) (3) The batteries that came with my NEW CS6529 phone were only 300 mAh. (4) The VTech factory outlet offers a 2-pack with 750mAh for $29.95 plus shipping, no mention of origin. My final purchase on Amazon Prime: iMa Ryme offers a 2-pack with 600mAh with the proper short cords for $6.95, made in China. So much stress over two little batteries!",73958,4401,4402,2,"This phone is the worst. I would give it no stars, but you must provide at least a one star rating...It is poorly made, has lousy audio and a weak directory. I have owned both V-Techs and Panasonics over the years, and the Panasonic is more capable, has better audio, especially on speaker phone, and is more durable. The Panasonic has a neat feature that announces the caller based on the caller ID, so you don't have to waste your time even picking up unwanted calls. It also has better blocking capability for robocalls and the like.Specific things I dislike about the V-Tech...the directory list of recent calls is limited to only 50. On top of that, the phone often fails to update a call. I have repeatedly picked up just after missing a call (coming in from the garden, etc.) and it does not display the number of the missed caller.The speaker audio is just not good. I have trouble hearing people when I use the hands free speaker.One of the phones broke within a five months . . . I could not hang up a call as the ""off"" (hand up button) did not hang up the call .

My wife and I are not spring chickens. The display on the handsets is so small as to be almost impossible to read.

When I got to the web sight it says to hold # until there is a beep. That works for about 5 minutes and than the message is back. The phone is light and cheep.

I was upset again to hear that a phone advertised as an Amazon refurbished product is not actually refurbished by Amazon or shipped by Amazon. It's very frustrating.

When I turn up the brightness the screen feels incredibly sharp and vibrant.Now, onto the bad parts of this phone.Everything else on this phone is terrible, and I'm not exactly sure why.We'll start with the most glaring of issues, the speed of the phone itself.I've never had a phone act slower than this one, straight out of the box and this device is UNBELIEVABLY SLOW. I cannot turn on YouTube and watch a video on it because whatever video I play will lag and drop frames. It isn't exclusive to YouTube either. Snapchat and a messaging app I use called Telegram basically cannot play any videos whatsoever without the phone stuttering and lagging. I can't even RECORD videos on the phone because the device fails to. When I start recording the phone starts dropping frames and stuttering, the final straw, and what made me write this review, happened when I tried to send someone a message, typed it out on the keyboard, and it took the phone a minute and a half to finish writing said message. It was 40 letters long. The performance on this phone is absolutely terrible.The battery life is also not great either. I use it pretty lightly throughout the day and it'll last be until I get home. But if I NEED to call anyone for any extended period of time, or use my GPS I can almost promise it'll die within an hour or two.I also had defects on the phone as soon as I got it, but was willing to deal with them because I could acknowledge that it was kind of an inexpensive phone. But there's an issue when your headphone jack basically freaks out and only works with one channel of the head phone unless you put the plug in at EXACTLY the right way. This lead to some embarrassing moments in my college class where I was trying to listen to some music and the phone decided to route the audio to the phone speaker and play it for the entire class.Honestly, I'm REALLY disappointed by this. Blu is the brand that got me into lesser-known flagship killer-esc phones. As soon as I broke my first Blue R1 HD I bought two more from Blu because it was such a solid phone. But now they're charging MORE for this device which is an inferior product all together, and lacks some of the horribly glaring issues that the Studio Mega has. Blu has literally worked backwards. I've owned the phone since the end of Feburary and I'm already thinking about buying another phone (Probably a Xiaomi or a Huawei) because I just don't want to deal with the technical errors, horrible battery life, and absolutely TERRIBLE performance of this phone.Honestly, at $70, I feel almost ripped off. And chances are I'll never buy another Blu ever again.",73976,4419,4420,0,"Android Oreo Go is a pathetic platform is a data hog. I loved my Blu Life XL, and this is a similar top of the line big screen phone, but Oreo is not Lollipop and nothing on it works unless you have a fast wifi connection, And the huge battery only lasts a few hrs, compare that with 2 days on my old phone. I can't answer a call, because I do not get an answer or hangup widget. There are no widgets at all on this phone. The camera does nothing but crash and it won't do video, or download all of my email, despite all the beautiful specs on this phone. How do I get a better OS? I have the recommended 32GB sd card.

Did exactly what I wanted distracted the 18 month old from taking my phone because she had her own. It lite up and made noise and was everything I was hoping for.

Amazon shouldn't allow products like this to be sold!",73982,4426,4427,1,This product is a waste of money. It is a cheaply made plastic phone that stops working and when you plug it in to charge it really doesnÂ’t charge. I unplugged it after 3 hours and it still did not turn on. My 1 year old granddaughter pressed every button and it did nothing. She left it alone and 15 minutes later it started going off on its own. Worked for about 10 minutes and then nothing again. It just randomly goes off but never works when she goes to play with it. I would recommend no one buy this as it is very cheaply made.,73983,4427,4428,1,"LESS than 1 star!!! As soon as I opened the package, I realized I completely messed up thinking this would be safe for infants.

It already looks like it will shock my child. Directly to the trash it goes. I cannot return it bc the shipping costs the same as the toy. Lesson Learned.

I don't understand understand how these have such rave reviews. I always scour the review section before purchasing anything on Amazon, so I'm surprised that I was let down.These Yoga shorts are terrible quality. The waistband doesn't ""stretch"" as described, and there's a strange lining in it that when trying to pull over my hips began to make a ripping sound. I've bought yoga pants from ALL OVER and these are the only ones that don't have that nice stretchy quality. If you're not a stick figure and have some butt/thighs/hips to work with, these shorts aren't happening.I'm 5'8"" 150, and have been a medium in every single pair of yoga pants or shorts that I've bought from multiple vendors. I followed the size chart and other reviews here and bought a medium. Could barely get them up my thighs.The overall polyester material of the shorts feels cheap and smelled funny out of the package.

The pictures looked great, the reviews excellent, everything I was looking for. I just got these Friday and they are not what was pictured or advertised. They came in a plain bag with a very generic labeling. I took the shorts out and they did not look at all like the photos. The waist band is a basic piece of thick elastic band about a half inch wide sewn into very thin cheap silky-ish fabric. The elastic is actually warping the waist because it seems a bit too long for the fabric itself. Next, THERE IS NO BRAND NAME ON THESE SHORTS. None. None at all. ItÂ’s like these originated from a dollar store. There is a white tag that says M and Â“made in ChinaÂ”. The fabric is not thick at all. The seams are off resulting in huge wedgies and camel toes. Yes, I did get the proper size! I figured I would give these a chance even with the weird generic packaging and no brand name on them, so here comes the big reveal...the try on.YIKES!!!! Upon just pulling them on, I heard several stitches popping. Okay. Not great. I got them on, the legs around where the leg elastic is are too tight around but the leg part itself is comfortable. Also, these are not high waisted at all. They come about halfway between my navel and my crotch area. Ok, maybe I just have to break them in? Wore them so go easy walking this morning at the park and upon my first quick walk, run, the legs started riding up until they looked like exercise panties.These are not good. I donÂ’t know what I got, but these WERE NOT the item that was advertised and pictured. Poor quality, broken stitches, not a brand label in sight. Paper thin flimsy material. They definitely did not send the item pictured! Huge disappointment.",73987,4431,4432,0,I'm so upset disappointed and was totally embarrassed.....I got them I was so excited....did a test run 2 miles ok cool......so this morning I get them to run a half marathon.....telling the girls all about them .. they really liked them .....ok now this is the sad part <U+0001F620><U+0001F620><U+0001F620>I'm at mile 4 something didn't feel right ...jumped into a Porta Jon.....they had ripped in the crotch....that good someone Dutch a long sleeve shirt ...I had to wrap it around me so I could keep running ....by the time I was done it was a 3 inch rip down there ..sorry but no star from me.,73988,4432,4433,0,"I bought 2 pairs of these. Black pair was in original plastic with tag. Blue pair was a repackage with no tag. I opened the plastic & the strong odor of FISH hit me in the face! Crotch stank to high heaven. Someone clearly wore them and either had bad hygiene or sweat a lot and then returned them. I contacted the seller and they apologized but couldn't do anything as it was fulfilled by Amazon. So, I returned both pair because that is just unacceptable. I am afraid to re-order as I might get the same rancid shorts back. So disappointed. I use Amazon for pretty much everything but groceries and this is the 3rd time I've gotten something that was obviously a return. The other two had things like a chewed up tag or animal hair on it. I can deal with that, but someone else's stink is just unsanitary.I did try on the new ones (WITH UNDERWEAR) and they do not cover the bellybutton.

They are very comfortable. Never left with a red mark around my waist. They are stretchy yet form fitting.I will be purchasing more since I love the longer length (no chub rub with this length), non shiny fabric and the high waist (above be belly button).

I was very excited because my Galaxy phone easily fit into the side pocket. I would like something a little less stiff in the fabric, but I figured it was worth the price. About 3 miles in I realized I was chafing at the very top, back to inner part of my thigh. I thought it was skin-on-skin so I tried adjusting the pants several times during my run. Once I got back I realized it was on both sides and appears to line up with the seam of the pants.I will probably give them another try after the spots have recovered and on a shorter run, but my initial verdict is that I can't wear them to run in, which was why I bought them.",73992,4437,4438,0,"I bought both a medium and a large. When I looked at the first pair, I knew they wouldn't fit. I tried on the medium and they were awful. So I kept the large. I am 5'6"" and 155 pounds give or take a few pounds either way. I wore the large on a walk on a hot day and they made me feel like I was wrapped in cellophane. I was so hot. I couldn't imagine why. I have been walking and running for ten years and this hasn't happened in any other brand. I thought maybe it was the extreme heat, so tonight it is much cooler and I went for a walk. The shorts were still hot and they cut into me at the waist, the dropped waist seam and at the hem. When I took them off, the seams at the gusseted crotch had pulled out. I don't mind if a brand puts me in an XL, but the reviews say these are true to size. Another review says she is 5'6"" and 180 and the large fits her well. I can't begin to imagine how that can be unless she carries her weight in her wrists or both pair I received were mismarked.",73993,4438,4439,0,"This product comes complete with a letter asking for a 5star review. Once this has been confirmed by the seller, you get a free undefined gift. Which means most of the glowing reviews here are coerced.As for the product, it's a thick foam rollup pad. I bought it for a child wanting to try yoga with a friend, and it was cheap, so it was fine for that I guess. While I'm not a Yoga expert, and can only reach my toes with a bended knee, this is a Pilates mat - NOT a Yoga mat.

While I thought it was great at first, the more I used it the more trouble I had with sinking into the mat while am trying to hold long and challenging poses. If you're doing sit ups, it's probably great as it's very very cushiony and feels great. Unfortunately, if you're doing advanced yoga postures that involve concentrated holds and balance, you start to sink into the foam, which can throw you off balance and in my case led to pain in my wrists. It's a shame as I was really excited about how comfortable it was at first, but now find that I just can't balance properly in the most challenging postures.",73995,4440,4441,0,"2.5 stars. The OPM has great potential. It really does. But it's not quite capitalizing upon it, This was my first yoga mat that I purchased. $10, what a steal, right? I have laminate floors and I could not do any routines without slipping and stretching the mat all over the place. I didn't realize how much harder and undesirable a routine could be when you had the extra distraction of a stretchy, slippery mat. I also thought that thicker would be more comfortable, but I am actually going to try a standard 1/4 inch mat instead of this one because it almost seems too thick. The only redeeming quality was that I did not experience any tears like other customers, but with the amount of stretching, I could definitely see it happening. I used this maybe 4 or 5 times but I want to move on to something else at this point.",73996,4441,4442,0,"I should have listened to the other reviewers! I bought this mat because I wanted to have less pain while doing exercises like modified pushups or yoga poses that involve contact with my back/knees. The mat is certainly thick and helped to reduce the amount of pain I felt in my knees and back bones. HOWEVER, after only a few uses the mat started to tear on its surface. Moreover, this mat slips really badly! I have laminate wood floors; however, I also have two other yoga mats in the house and they do NOT slip.",73997,4442,4443,0,"I was blown away by the high rating this mat received and the non-tear guarantee. So I bought it. After only a 10 pilates classes, it began to tear between the ridges. I'm very disappointed. I returned it for a full refund. Granted, the cushioning is awesome and the material didn't have a toxic odor. But, what good is it if it tears even with the guarantee. Obviously, since I'm not the first and only one to have this experience, there's a design flaw. In pilates, there isn't as much stressing and stretching of the mat like in yoga. So I imagine it will just tear faster if using this for yoga practice.Side Note: This is a dangerous mat for yoga practice. It's very stretchy and slips easily making it unreliable for poses that require stability like warrior, vinyasa, and down dog. It's best suited for more static purposes like pilates, crunches or cool down stretching, where more cushion is needed under knees and spine.",73998,4443,4444,0,"This top is very slinky and soft, which makes it very comfortable. Unfortunately when I jump up and down in my aerobics classes it creeps up and bunches at my waist. I don't want to show my stomach while I am working out, so I have to keep pulling it down during the high intensity jumping routines. But when we aren't jumping up and down, it stays put and is fine.

Read so many reviews where customers sized up but i highly recommend that if anything we should size down.

When I saw them on line and was less expensive than what I paid for in the store, I thought it was a no brainer to get a few more leggings. WrongÂ….I bought 3 pairs. Two of them are the capris and the other is full length.These are the issues I have with the leggings:1. The fabric is subpar. On each pair of capris, the texture was different from each other. One pair had a smooth finish and the other was not. I donÂ’t think there should be such a difference since they are the same style.2. The fabric is see thru. When you look at it, without stretching, no problem. However, when you bend forward, you can see what god gave you. I even tried wearing nude panties. You can still see everything. So, there is no way I will wear them when I go to Pilates. I can only wear them under my long tops that cover my bottom.3. The elastic at the waistband is inconsistent. Each pair has different issues. One pair, the first time putting them on, I heard a bunch of threads breaking. Now when I wear them, the waistband is not secure. I keep pulling them up. Then the 2nd pair, threads were breaking too, but the waistband is still secure. The 3rd pair, the waistband keeps rolling down on me.4. The rise of the leggings is inconsistent. These leggings are suppose to be at the waist. 2 of mine are at the waist; however, one of them is just below my bellybutton.5. The crotch of 2 of them keep falling down. On of them the waistband is at my waist and the other is not.6. The color of the Â“new oliveÂ” isnÂ’t green. ItÂ’s a grey that has green overtones not blue-black, not what was pictured on line. The color reminds of my clay dirt in my yard. Not a pretty grey.I would say donÂ’t bother wasting your money buying these leggings.

However, after trying my normal size in this style (S - 140, 5'7"") and noticing that they fit a lot smaller than usual, I went up one size. I tried the medium pair on and thought they looked as good as they felt . . . having never had an issue with the pants being sheer, and because they looked completely solid when I stood in front of the mirror, I thought I was good to go. NOPE. I don't know if the style, manufacturer, fabric composition, or what has changed, but these bad boys are NOT the same quality as they have been in the past.

My favorite Mossimo leggings from Target were discontinued, and I was looking for a replacement. I purchased both a Large and a Medium and was pleasantly surprised with how sturdy the fabric felt and how well the Medium fit. I bent over to do a squat and was even more excited when my bright pink underwear wasnÂ’t even showing through! I recently decided to add to my collection with a size medium 2 pack (black and heather charcoal). Imagine my dismay when I pulled the black pair out of the bag and the material felt very thin compared to my original pair!! I held them up to the light and could see completely through them! I pulled them on over the same pair of bright pink underwear, and without even squatting, my underwear was clearly visible. The grey pair seems to be made of the same fabric as my original black pair, but whatÂ’s the point in paying for 2 leggings to only get one usable pair! The original fabric was AMAZING, they might be the best leggings I have ever worn (and I basically LIVE in leggings). But the fabric seems to have been modified recently (perhaps to cut down on manufacturing costs?) and the new material is HORRIBLE! IÂ’m a very disappointed customer. IÂ’ve included a video with a flashlight demonstration to show how see-through theyÂ’ve become!",74021,4466,4467,0,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to give a review for a product I purchased on Amazon. Several months ago I purchased a pair of these 90 Degree by Reflex - High Waist Tummy Control Capris in Dark Navy, and I absolutely loved them. The fit was true, they were very good quality and I loved the fabric, which was very wicking but not see thru. I decided to order another pair, this time in Charcoal Grey. The order was fulfilled by another vendor, CJ Technology, and this color showed that it would ship in 3-4 weeks, which I was ok with. When the pants arrived, they were NOTHING like the first pair that I had. The first pair was a size Medium, and this second pair was also a Medium, but it had to be a Child's medium. I've attached a photo of the two pairs, one on top of the other. I thought maybe they were meant to stretch out when you tried them on, but I couldn't even get an ankle through the leg hole, they were as tight as compression stockings and no way I could get them on. The fabric is completely different than the first pair, it's more of a lycra, shimmery dance pants fabric with less wicking. I requested a return, and was offered to keep the gray pair, with a 50% refund, if I didn't ship them back. Nice offer, but I have no use for a pair of yoga pants that would fit a child. They're going back.",74022,4467,4468,0,"Returning! In the reviews I read, most people said that these run small and to order a size up. Well...IÂ’m pretty well endowed and need a lot of support for my workouts and so I actually ordered a size down. And...it was not even remotely supportive! When I first put it on, I thought it might be...even though I could see pretty major jiggle from just a slight bounce. Then, the longer I had it in, the more I could feel my breasts pulling the bra down in front and pulling it up in the back. I want a sports bra thatÂ’s going to keep the girls where theyÂ’re supposed to be without having to pull and tug on it every 2 seconds. IÂ’m not sure I would even wear these for just lounging around the house!",74023,4468,4469,0,"I followed the guide and should have been a medium I'm a 36 but don't know what cup I am because I've lost 14 pounds due to weight loss. I tried one on right away as soon as they showed up. Way to tight, squished the ladies and very painful around the ribcage and back. So then I had my oldest daughter try one on, she's a 34B....to tight for her too.so then I had my youngest 12 year old try one on, she's very tall and slender and barely out of training bra's.....it fit her and the only good part of all of this is she likes them because it makes her look like she has boobs and the color. Disappointed and would have been nice to treat myself to new sports bras from weight loss.",74024,4469,4470,0,"This is the worst sports bra ever! The padding isnÂ’t connected to anything and moves freely inside the fabric. It looks like 1980Â’s shoulder pads stuffed in between 2 pieces of cheese cloth. I thought IÂ’d give it a try since I bought them, but after 10 minutes of jogging I can tell the girls arenÂ’t getting the support they need and the awesome free-floating padding has migrated to where they truly belong...my shoulders. So now I look ready for the power position of my dreams and IÂ’m moving on to a name brand athletic bra for the girls!",74025,4470,4471,2,"I ordered the 3XL based on my size 1) I bulged out of the sides 2) sagged like a sleeping bra. Additionally, I could immediately smell that same horrible ""gassing off"" smell from petroleum products - like a cheap shoe store/shoe section at Walmart or many of the bathroom shower curtains or non-slip tub mats. I tried on one carefully, but it had a noticeable black smudge on it and the pads in the cup liners shifted around easily. There is also NO WAY to adjust the traps. Otherwise, the bright colors were pretty and it was somewhat soft. I was hoping these would give relieve to my aching shoulders and my shoulder bra dents, but sending them back. Yuck.",74026,4471,4472,2,"These fit fine, but the pink bra was NOT colorfast. I'm extremely lucky in that, of the whole load of laundry I ran with these bras in it, only a pillowcase, a towel, and the white bra were ruined by the pink one. Even going back and putting the bra in a sink to soak out the rest of the dye, there's still a TON in there. This could have literally ruined half of my entire wardrobe. The others seem fine. I don't know why the pink is so insanely full of dye still.I have now spent DAYS trying to get all the excess dye out of the pink bra. It's impossible. I've soaked it in hot water, in cold. I've soaked it in a washer full of water, by itself. I've used vinegar and salt. I've done everything I can think of to get this bra colorfast, and it just doesn't work.

Save your money and absolutely look for something else. Stay with 1/2 inch though, as that's a great thickness.

It does have that new mat odd chemical smell, but I expect that will go away in time. The mat is comfortable, and perfect for sciatic stretching. I'm just upset that I didn't get the strap as promised. If I'd know the ad was incorrect and there was no strap, I never would have ordered it. If you're looking for a mat you can carry, do not order this one!",74030,4475,4476,0,"This mat has a chemical smell that attaches to you like in the Seinfeld episode The Smelly Car.

The smell has defeated all of these methods which is quite impressive. I did use it twice, and it was nice. However, I cannot take the smell.",74031,4477,4478,0,"These are just ok, and there are many comparably priced gym pants out there that are much better. The fabric is nice, but the waistline and ankles are problematic. The ankles are really loose and the waistline has a thin piece of elastic at the very top, rather than the single thick, fitted high waist of higher quality pairs. These also kind of flatten the butt, so ladies with a smaller waist and a bigger butt, youÂ’ve been warned haha. IÂ’m 5Â’4 and 117 and the small fits ok, so IÂ’d say they run true to size.

The material is super soft and not at all like those work out clothes spandex. My only problem is, given my height, there was an extra 3 or so inches of fabric left over!! Around the house, no biggie, but if I were to leave IÂ’d look messy!",74035,4482,4483,0,"The material on these pants is fine, relatively thin, but not awful. It is not compression-fit material in any way, however. The problem is that there is a thick, stiff, wide (~1-1.5inches) piece of elastic in the waistband of these pants. This results in the high waistband squeezing tightly around your abdomen and the thin, stretchy, non-compressive material below it creating a reverse muffin-top. Super ugly and incredibly uncomfortable. Why would you need an elastic band that stiff around the waistband?? Perhaps if you had an incredibly small waist compared to your hips. I am a classic apple shape with a small bum and an average sized waist. I usually wear a size small in yoga pants, but I went with the size chart on these and ordered a medium. The fit was ok, but that might have explained why I found them in no way compression-fit. Still, if I had gotten a small, the elastic at the waist might have crushed my abdominal organs.",74036,4483,4484,0,"UGH. So frustrated by these. First, I bought the purple, ankle-length striped leggings. I loved them. Now, they are no Lululemons (they are that slightly shinier type of spandex rather than the soft/cotton-feeling kind), but for 20 bucks, they fit well, weren't see-through, and looked cute. Great alternative to something like Fabletics.In fact, I liked them so much, I bought the navy, ankle-length with the folds. Worth three stars, but I'm knocking to one because the product is so different from the purple pair. They should really be a separate listing with their own set of reviews, not just a different color. Issues:- The stripe pair had a thick elastic band at the waist, the fold pair does not, and while exercising I am constantly pulling them up- The knee and calf are TIGHT! Like almost hard to pull over my legs. I'm thin but do have strong calves, though I've never had a problem with boots, pants, or leggings being snug. These are uncomfortable, leave marks, and make it hard to pull up as described above.- See through. At first I didn't realize it, but looking in the mirror at pilates... yes, there's my underwear.Very frustrated by the folded pair but I do endorse the striped pair. One star to the company for having such wildly different products under the listing.",74037,4484,4485,2,"I am 6' tall about 170lbs. I have very long legs, 37"" inseam that are not heavy at all. Athletic build. I gave up a long time ago trying to find legging that will fit the length of my legs. Even if they are advertised as ankle leggings I just expect them to be capris on me. These fit like capris as I expected which is not the problem. I ordered a size XL which should have fit me comfortably. I understand that these are more like compression leggings, however, I could barely get these over my thighs and butt. They dug into my calfs and stomach terribly. I couldn't imagine working out in these without being out of breath from how tight they are. According to the measurments they should have fit me. Very disappointed. I would recommend these legging based on the quality of the material and how high the waist is. My advise would be to order a size up.",74038,4485,4486,0,"I really wanted to like these, but the construction at the waist really has me scratching my head. There is a waistband, about an inch thick, right at the top, that is tighter than the rest of the waist/tummy section. So, compression is not really happening in an evenly distributed way. I wore them once to a yoga class, and it was the worst I've ever felt about my figure. I'll be sticking to the leggings I already have (that don't have the weird super-tight elastic band at the top) while I look for something that fits better.",74039,4486,4487,0,"I want to love this product. Months ago, I bought the ankle-black and ankle-white and they were absolutely perfect. Couldn't see my underwear. They were thick. They had a perfect compression. They were FIVE STARS. No, TEN STARS.So why the two stars now? Well, when the side of my ankle-black was ripped by walking by something sharp, I decided I needed a new one. And why not stop there? I selected a new ankle-black, ankle-darkgrey, ankle space dye white, and fold-blue. They arrived today (11/8/2018). The only one worth keeping is the ankle-black.Ankle-darkgrey, ankle space dye white, and fold-blue, with all of them the fabric felt significantly thinner. In fact, I could pretty much see my skin through ankle space dye white, as well as every inch of my underwear. Ankle darkgrey I could have loved, but as I ordered an XL, as I pulled them on they were obviously a size L. It does say XL on the tag/fabric. And lastly, fold-blue did have a nice fit... except for the folds around the calves. They are unforgiving and dig in. When I flex my my calves (i.e. walking), I feel bands of uncomfortable pressure. The fit everywhere but the salves was perfect. Somehow the ankle-black one is usable. Even then, it still feels thinner than my other ankle-black.I'll be returning all but the ankle-black. Suspicious thing is, despite ordering them all at the same time, they came in different packages. With the ankle-black coming by itself. It makes me suspicious that the other three are some kind of knock offs, despite all of them coming in the fancy 'dragonfit' bags.This disappointed me greatly. I thought these were going to be THE pants. Two stars for the fact that I got one pair out of four that I can use. So, while I can't speak for the capri, I can speak for the ankle length ones. The only ones worth getting are ankle-black and ankle-white, in my opinion. Everything else is a really big gamble.",74040,4487,4488,2,"I ordered these after a year of just wearing regular leggings or running shorts to spin. They are very soft and have great give; they are not impossibly tight on my stomach like so many other higher waisted work out pants I try on. The downside to these shorts are that they are thin and thus, fairly see through when bending or moving about. Additionally, they roll up a bit while I'm riding my bike and I'm constantly pulling them down. I don't mind as much of how thin or see through they are as my bike is in our home, I just wouldn't wear them out in public. I'm more bothered that they roll up, that drives me a little crazy, especially during an interval ride where I'm up and down out of the seat. They don't roll as much at all when I'm just working out afterward and not on my bike. Therefore, I would recommend them if you are just looking for something to wear around the house, to do a light workout in or if you're wearing them underneath of something else.",74041,4488,4489,0,"I liked the way they fit and looked on me but going out into public in those isnÂ’t something IÂ’d do because theyÂ’re see through.

IÂ’ve tried doubling up by wearing one over another one and itÂ’s almost a lil too tight and uncomfortable having on.

It looks like it goes sideways, so these's a weird seam in the center that is a little uncomfortable. Pads and liners don't stick well because the middle part doesn't lay flat like most underwear. There's usually a layer of fabric in women's underwear that's shaped so the pad or liner will lay flat. I feel like these shorts must have been designed by a male, because a woman would have definitely seen this problem and designed them differently! I Iove the material and they are very comfortable otherwise. I just wish the inside seam was different.",74043,4490,4491,1,I really wanted to love these shorts. I didn't want them for working out. Just for wearing under my summer dresses. Unfortunately the first pair I pulled out had a hole near the front of the leg. So I decided to take out the other two pairs and check them out. Didn't see any holes. But I'm sure after a couple of wears they would fall apart. They are as thin as a panty hose. They weren't tight. But the band was very thin and didn't add any support. They would be ok if you were laying around the house. But the fact that the first pair had a hole in it. I cannot recommend these shorts at all. I wouldn't want to spend more then 2$ each.

I bought them for underwear and they are a little long, but the seams turned out to be not bad at all.

The towel has a lining fabric(the black on the grey part) and it feels like flannel.

And yes I do mean a strip of cloth. If you put it around your neck, there is only a very small area that touches your skin and a whole lot hanging down.

What I love about it is that I can get the support I need and it is comfortable. This used to be a good bra, but the new bras I just ordered are just horrible. There are a lot of problems with how these bras are being made, from the straps to the stitching, to the inconsistent sizing, to the metal clasps on the band. The straps are way too short. I compared the new bras I just ordered to the bras I own and the straps are definitely much shorter. Because the straps are much shorter, even when fully extended, the bra sits much higher, uncomfortably too far up into my armpit. When I hooked the metal clasps on the band, I noticed the clasps are pulling right out of the fabric! It looks as though each individual metal clasp is not anchored properly and securely. I am VERY disappointed in the quality of how these Champions bras are being made. Sizing is inconsistent too. I have ordered these bras online from Amazon, from Champion directly, and bought from a factory outlet location. It does not matter where you purchase these bras from because I have experienced the same problems. I have also experienced the stitching on the seams being extremely scratchy, abrasive on the skin, as others have commented about (although not on these recently ordered ones). Ordering these bras is definitely a gamble because you never know what you will get. If you do decide to purchase, make sure you order with a free return shipping option because it is likely you will have to return. I will be returning these bras.

If these do not work out for you, you will have to pay the return shipping. It cost me almost as much to ship them back as it did to make the purchase in the first place. The seller's English is not always understandable when you are writing messages back and forth. The flesh color is closer to peach, and the straps did not lie flat for me, particularly in the shoulder area just behind the armpit. I would have had to cut out the arm holes and reline them in order to get the fit I needed. One good feature was the material that protects you from the zipper rubbing against your skin. I had to buy the XL ( I normally get a L )so there was no possibility of getting a better size.",74055,4503,4504,0,"Right after my breast augmentation, it felt comfortable to wear. But only after a few days it became less and less comfortable because as the swelling came down, the braÂ’s stretchy material offered no support or compression for my breasts and the straps were looser so my shoulders and neck didnÂ’t have support. At night when I would sleep with it on, I would be in sooo much pain in the morning because my breasts would move around slightly during the night. I decided to look for another alternative. I ended up buying 5 other ones and the one I ultimately kept and am currently wearing day and night is the Kimikal post-surgery bra. IÂ’ll be leaving a review on there so you can see why itÂ’s amazing. Last note, these zip front bras are fine if you are just looking for something to lounge around in.",74056,4505,4506,0,"The bras are nice but I was sent the wrong size. The black one has a tag that says 36B, when I ordered the size small (30A-32A). The gray one doesn't have a tag but it feels like it's about the same size as the black one, which is too big. Also, the two bras I ordered (came in a ""2-pack"") are vastly different from each other. They have opposite sided zippers from each other; the black one has a raw elastic band while the gray one's elastic is covered with fabric; and the black one is also more of regular style straps/back while the gray is racerback style (like the picture). I don't really care that much about these differences I just wanted the correct size. I will update my review if/when I hear from the seller and if they can/will help me out. Since I am having my surgery in a week and the items took a week to arrive (I pay for amazon prime and they did not arrive on time), I can't afford to send them back in case the replacement doesn't arrive on time because I have to have something to wear after my surgery, even if it doesn't fit.",74057,4506,4507,0,"I was told to buy front closure bras in advance of my mastectomy. These had decent reviews but when it finally came time to use them, I realized that they only have a zipper in the front and no hook to help hold the bra closed while you try to zipper it. I had a single mastectomy and had limited use of my left arm so trying to zipper close a bra (under tension) was almost impossible. The Jockey bras that I bought had the hook and were MUCH easier to use. Further, even though I up-sized and bough a Large (medium is more my size), these bras had very tight arm holes and I found that they would chaf/rub under my arm which created an abrasion.

Everything had its natural sag, so there wasn't even a hint of this bra ""trying"" to be supportive.. like one of those spandex camisoles with the built-in shelf bra.I would not recommend this bra for anybody who is a DD+ cup, and I'm really not sure if I would recommend it to anyone. Yes, it is cheap and it is cute, but it just did not work out for me.",74059,4508,4509,0,"The sizing is right on for me. The first problem is the amount of coverage-it's too much. The panel between the cups is so ridiculously high on my chest that when I wear my v neck shirts, it shows. I don't even know what purpose it's supposed to serve anyway. It doesn't help to control bounce whatsoever. It seems like a modesty panel at most. I'm all about modesty and no one needs any cleavage when working out; however, this panel serves no purpose and it shows! The second problem that I noticed is that the seams show underneath my shirts. Between the panel showing and the seams poking through, I would be so embarrassed if I had to be seen in public with this on under my clothes. Finally, this does not control or eliminate bounce. The fit was perfect, but all the other problems made this a no go and I'm returning for a refund. Very disappointed.",74060,4509,4510,0,"This bra has a fatal flaw. See that multi-colored trim that wraps the edges? I am convinced that little strip of material is a blend of steel wool, bee stings, and bad dating decisions. The bra is indeed Â“no-bounceÂ” but only because movement of any kind is quickly discouraged by the sadistic trim that again, wraps the edges of the bra, guaranteeing multi-point skin contact. If a bra that raises welts is your thing, then look no further, this is the bra for you! If, on the other hand, you think the mark of an excellent bra is one that supports without constantly, and painfully, calling attention to itself, your quest continues.The one upside to this bra? It will re-introduce you to the full-body experience of gratitude when you take it off. Hope this helps.",74061,4510,4511,0,I'm highly disappointed. I researched I thought fairly well to find a plus size sports bra. An with all the reviews from other sources and amazon. I was sure this be a great purchase. I wear a 44I an that's after going through many different plus size clothing companies and finding quality bras that do all the wonderful things needed to keep your breast off the ground. So hear I am happy to find a sports bra that has my size an may hold the twins in place so I can workout without injury. Well nope I was wrong. I can't even get the hooks closed let alone within 2inches of one another to attempt hooking them. Also no give from elastic just nothing. From what I can tell the cup size is spot on. It just felt like I had a 40 or 42 instead of a 44.,74062,4511,4512,0,"So disappointing after reading such good reviews! I started running and needed a good sports bra to keep to keep the twins from bouncing so much. I thought this bra would be a good fit but it's not. There is NO underwire for any sort of support which to me is insanity especially for us busty gals. So you'll get as much support as wearing a t-shirt with no bra. It was NOT tight fitting, form fitting or even fitting the correct way that it should. It seemed a little loose but the band that goes right under your bust was way too big. The band should be tighter and smaller than your bust line NOT the same size. I tried tightening the straps and was only able to tighten it up to an inch before I ran out of space. Guess I'll just have to find a different bra.-Not a bad looking sports bra-No Support-No Underwire-No Padding-Fits somewhat larger than regular sizing-Straps doesn't tighten up enough-A total waste of time!",74063,4512,4513,0,"I read reviews and saw ppl raving about these pants. Not sure which ones they ordered but this is why I am returning:1. The size tag is sewn into the Â“butt crackÂ” seam and leaves a less than desired, non smooth look.2. The leg length is super long. I have never had an issue in pant length-ever. I would have to fold these several times or have stacked leggings and that is just ridiculous.3. They do not pass the bend over test. I can see right through them. No thanks.Apparently IÂ’m not one of the lucky ones.",74064,4513,4514,1,No stars if it was up to me. I have no clue how anyone can say these are squat proof. I ordered two pies because of the amazing reviews and received the most horrendous leggings I could have bought material myself and made a better pair. The are NOT true to size. IÂ’m 5Â’8Â” 190 pounds with an athletic build. The leggings hardly made it over my heels let alone my hips. The material is CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. I would not compare these to any high end legging. Buyer beware.,74065,4514,4515,0,I used to love these leggings. They were my absolute favorite leggings ever. Then they completely changed them. TheyÂ’ve added these weird unnecessary seams all over the place so the leggings donÂ’t stretch or move with your body at all. The worst thing about the new design is the seam that is supposed to hold up the pants. ItÂ’s goes straight across your butt rather than at your waist. Every two steps I take I have to pull them up. I donÂ’t even wear these on a day when IÂ’m squatting. These will be going in the trash as soon as I find a replacement brand I like. Super disappointing because at one point these were my favorite and the only pair of leggings I would wear.,74066,4515,4516,1,"This is not the product described. I have ordered these before (the black pair on the left) and they are amazing!! but when I ordered again (the gray pair) I received a horrible imitation. It clearly came from China from the packaging, was super thin, the waistband made a ripping sound as I put them on, and it had no brand markings or tags like the real pair. The black pair (real Tesla brand) were supportive and comfortable. The gray pair pinched my waste but was loose and unsupportive through the butt/crotch. Be careful! I guess this seller is sending out fake ones.",74067,4516,4517,0,"These are somewhat sheer material, which I do not like. They are thinner than other brands which makes them shoe flaws easily.

I'm sure others in my yoga class can smell it, too! So annoying doing child's pose and you're breathing in this toxic smell. The mat is slippery when doing down ward dog or warrior poses. Also, it is so thick and squishy that it's hard to hold one legged poses...feels like you're standing on a sponge. The worse is that after 2-3 weeks of doing yoga, you can see indents as to where you've placed your hands & feet for certain poses. I have a pink colored mat and those ""spots"" now look like swirls of ""smooched bubble gum""---I'm not sure how else to describe it. The price is good, but it is seriously a piece of junk if you want to practice yoga on it. Would never recommend it.",74069,4518,4519,0,"In a quick scan of reviews I saw a comment or two about an odor, but others said theirs was fine so I took the leap. The mat arrived in great shape and fully enclosed in a tight clear wrap. I unrolled it and put some objects on the highly curled ends so I could use it later in the day. When I tried to lie on it the odor was overwhelming. I placed clothing under my head to not transfer that smell to my hair. Afterwards, I placed a fresh charcoal filter that's great for freshening closets right next to it. No improvement overnight. I then put it outside for a half day. When I brought it in, it had not improved and it was the first thing I smelled in the morning when I entered the large living space. So, this morning I put it back outside, until high winds forced it back inside. I recently dealt with a shower curtain that took a week to dissipate its pool toy smell and a table protector that spent time outside before Thanksgiving dinner. Neither of those products were as stubborn to release odor or as repungent. I find this odor more on the order of a dead animal smell than a manufacturing/chemical smell. If this eventually turns out to be the best mat on the planet, I'll write an update. For now I'll be busy trying to find the most out of the way place to stash it until it decides to ""lighten up.""",74070,4519,4520,0,"I wish I had not waited so long to use this. If I had used it even once in the window of time to send it back, I would have.First of all, it's too thick in a very supportive way. It is impossible to balance on it because it is spongy and gives under your feet.Any post that has a lunge or a standing split is impossible on this too, because it stretches. You start in one split and it puts you in a much deeper one as the mat gives way in both directions.I will probably give this to my dog as a dog bed, because that's very much all it's good for.",74071,4520,4521,1,"This is a very well cushioned mat, BUT I've used it for hot yoga and hiit training and it's terrible. I started using this for hot yoga two weeks ago, and there are already deep depressions where I put my hands and feet. It's only a matter of time before it rips in those spots. Then I tried using it for my hiit training, and the mat slipped around too much. I would not recommend this. I would rather have a harder, sturdier, and less cushioned mat than this one.",74072,4521,4522,1,"I just purchased this mat and used it last night for the first time during a 75 minute hot yoga class. I wish I would have taken the reviews more seriously and not wasted my money. It is such a thick, squishy mat that it is incredibly hard to balance; I have been practicing yoga for 4 1/2 years and normally don't have an issue with balance. While doing the 2nd tree pose during class, I finally decided it would be best to just do it on the cork floor instead of the mat. Don't waste your money if you're planning on using this to do yoga. I'm sure that it's good for other types of workouts, but not yoga and anything that requires balance.",74073,4522,4523,2,Had previously bought a similar pack of sports bras to these. Just wanted different colors. These ones are nothing like my others. The elastic band on the bottom is much slimmer and only washed 2 or 3 times and the padding got messed up (which happens in most sports bras). I pulled the pad the rest of the way out to straighten before putting it back in and apparently there's a silky fabric over the pad... Well both back and front silk came off so now i cannot even begin to get the pad back in. If i do there's no way to straighten it because it sticks too much.

I ordered the large first because of the other reviews, and the size chart saying that they run a little small. It ended up fitting okay, and gave good support, but good lord, the armpit boobs were awful. I figured maybe i just ordered it too small and ordered it again in Xlarge, but again, the armpit boobs were still very VERY visible. I think its the way these bras are designed. They come to a point at the shoulders, and the straps are at an awkward place in the front, and its because of this, that the dreaded armpit boobs persist. I really really wanted to love these, the back straps are so cute! but theres no way I can walk around with 2 extra boobs hanging out the sides.",74076,4525,4526,0,"These are ridiculously small. I couldn't be more disappointed. In the land of bra makers if you aren't fifteen pounds under the minimum healthy weight for your height, you're fat and can't possibly have no bosom. After nursing four kids, there is nothing left up top. Due to massive GI issues I can no longer wear underwire. That means I'm screwed if I want anything that actually contains more than lace to cover all the bits and pieces. This bra did that, but it also dug into my shoulders and caused a lot of pain. Yep, I have a neck and back injury too. While pretty and made with nice material, these are totally unwearable for a thin person who is taller than 4'9"" and can't afford to buy augmentation.",74077,4526,4527,0,"I bought these padded sports bras so I could go about my daily life looking like I actually possessed breasts and then workout when time allowed. They are padded, which is nice, but the material is too giving and reminds me more of a preteen training bra than a sports bra; the bras offer almost no support. They are not discreet, either--the neckline is almost up to my clavicle, so forget wearing any shirt other than, say, a turtleneck if I don't want my bra showing.",74078,4527,4528,1,"My first review: Very cute looking but dark to see through.Then I was happily surprised that SUNGAIT gave me a discount code to buy brand new sunglasses for 99% off I was going to change it to a 5 star review.Thennnn out of no where SUNGAIT sent me Â“freeÂ” sunglasses because my first pair was too dark, only catch was when ups dropped them off they told me I owed a $36 shipping fee because they came from China and went through customs.

I was like wow I need a pair of these bc I'm always on a computer at work and always reading on my kindle and phone. So when I got home I searched for glasses and decided to order these. When I put them on it was weird. There was a big glare all around the edges of the glasses if you were around the light. They did tone the blue light down on the screens but they strained my eyes so bad I had to take them off. Idk if I had a dud pair or if they are all like these. They are also rather big on your face. I tried them in different lighting settings and the glare just wouldn't go away even looking around the room. As soon as I took them off my eyes felt relief.

I have real blue blockers from my eye doctor (was just looking for a cheap throw around pair) that are a night and day difference from these. Anyone who reviews these high truly doesn't know what they should be getting.If you're going for ""cute"" and don't care about what they do to your eyes over time, then they might work for you.

I can feel the rim on my right cheek but itÂ’s completely off my left cheek. I am planning on returning them or reaching out the the company for them to replace them.

I contacted customer service to see if maybe I had received a pair of bad lenses and I was told that I had bought the blue mirror lenses and that the insides were not black. That very few people see reflections. They offered replacement all black lenses which were not Blue Reflective as I had ordered. I accepted the replacements which took close to 2 weeks to arrive. Upon receipt I attempted to put the replacements on and noticed that the replacements were significantly bigger and no matter how much I tried they would not fit. Note I have purchases Oakleys in the past and have replaced multiple lenses on glasses. I kept losing them or breaking them which is why I decided to try a cheaper alternative. Anyways, I contacted customer service to let them know of the issue. I even included a picture showing the difference in size which was pretty significant when stacked with the old lens. I was told that ""according to the principle of sunglasses production. To replace the lenses, the new ones need to be bigger than the old ones"". Well after much trying to no avail my wife decided to file the edges down of the new lenses which after after about 30min or so of filing they finally popped in.

It's noticeable in direct sun and out of direct sun. It's trippy and distracting. Secondly, the lenses actually make vision worse. Contrast, glare, and resolution were all worse than wearing no sunglasses in bright sun.The general reason first, and this only applies to clear plastic frames: they look cool, but they refract sunlight, so you end up with all sorts of little hotspots of reflected and refracted and focused light around your eyes, which is incredibly distracting and dangerous.

I searched the reviews for mention of ice tech before purchasing and there weren't any mentions so I hope this helps others. I would also say these lenses are on the larger side, noticeably larger than my prior women's sunglasses which were listed as Lens width: 54 millimeters; Lens height: 41 millimeters. But these were listed as Lens width: 52 mm; Lens height: 42 millimeters so not sure what's going on there... I have a larger head for a woman and I would prefer lenses a bit smaller and shorter.

I love the styling and actually got many compliments on these. People were surprised they were ""cheap"" sunglasses from Amazon. Most thought they were high-end.

Even though I thought odd that one of the sides broke. So, I purchased a second pair. This pair broke in the identical area using them as I've used every other pair of sunglasses I've owned. These were not treated any differently from other glasses I've owned. They broke in the same area, near the rivet that holds the ear piece to the frame. So obviously there is a defect here. I would purchase another item.",74104,4555,4556,1,"These glasses looked like in person how they seem in the picture. The lenses hd effect worked how I thought it would. Otherwise, they were smaller than I was hoping and there was significant reflection on the inside of the lenses while in use which is always a negative feature for glasses. I think this is due in part to the fact that they let too much light in from the side. On top of this, they broke after only like a week of use. The temple part of the frame is made of cheap plastic and while I was taking them off one day I notice it had warped and had begun to split in two. I had not sat on them or otherwise done anything to warp them so severly. Spend your money on something better.",74105,4556,4557,0,"I loved these sunglasses. I thought it was incredibly clever how they got around making them look like wayfayers with the removable parts that they give you the tools to remove. Very clever design. However, after a month of on and off use the temple snapped in the middle while placing on my head. It was clear the plastic on the temple was not a sturdy as I had thought. Really sad because I loved everything about these sunglasses from the polarization to the design and feel.",74106,4557,4558,1,"These look pretty good at first glance, but they feel like they would snap in half with very little pressure. They are polarized, but for some reason they actually make it harder for me to see things like my phone or my dashboard display while driving. If you are out in sunlight, they create all kinds of glare which is very distracting. I would suggest you spend a few dollars more and get a better made pair of sunglasses that actually sharpen your vision instead of making it worse.",74107,4558,4559,0,"Two glasses for the price of one? Sounded too good to be true, and sadly it was. The frames are nice and light and the temple length was perfect for me, but itÂ’s impossible for me to wear so theyÂ’re getting returned.There is a distortion in the lens, which if you only wear the glasses for up to half an hour at a time, probabl wouldnÂ’t be noticable. But I wear my glasses for hours at a time on almost a daily basis. Wore these on a 2.5 hour long road trip when I started getting a headache, the cause being eyestrain. If you have less than 20/20 vision you might never see the distortion, but I noticed objects more than 50 feet away were blurred with the glasses on. Not a good thing, especially when using for driving.",74108,4560,4561,0,"Lightweight and actually polarized (I ordered a pair from another seller that said it was but wasn't). There is a good amount of stretch in the glasses that make it really comfortable to wear, you can hardly feel them yet they are secure enough they don't slide off your face when you bend over. They feel a little flimsy, but haven't broken for me yet. I'm disappointed in the sun protection from the side. I still have to shield my eyes or adjust my head if the sun is at my side because these glasses are really flat with tiny frames that allow a lot of light from the sides.",74109,4561,4562,0,Definitely not polarized. False advertising there. The green and gold pair I got are super cute and fit well. The black pair is smaller and the frame is slightly bent in. They arenÂ’t comfy to wear they are too tight on my head so I doubt I will get any use of them.

Honestly, the only reason I even realized this is because I recently bought an exact pair again (my original pair got stolen....funny now knowing whoever stole them, stole fake ones!) through Amazon and noticed they were a bit different from the ones I initially got. Out of curiosity I decided to check online to see if there were different types of the gold frame/crystal blue gradient lens, but instead I stumbled upon some of the reviews on here (which I probably should have read before purchasing my original pair) stating some were fake. After doing some online research and reviewing the original case, info pamphlet, and lens wiper given to me, I realized the ones I originally purchased were in fact replicas!For those of you buying these aviators, MAKE SURE the pair you are buying are being sold from Amazon, as these are authentic.

And the print is also slightly larger if I am not wrong.Later I found the followings:1) It did not have the square shaped sticker bar-code on the paper box.2) In the nose shoe there is no 'R.B' rather there is 'R B' and the seller intentionally scratched the noes shoe so that it become unreadable.3) In the left leg part of the white print is already gone.4) Moreover, I am writing about a feature. May be this is not correct cause I could not find this feature over internet but discovered myself.I have 4 pairs of Ray Ban's in all of them in one nose shoe in printed in inverted alignment with the other.

I've tried to wiped these spots off, and as time passes, more spots appear!I am SO disappointed!!I was amazed at how nice these are!

It seems to divide the lens in half with the top part being amber and the bottom being somewhat blue. The back of the lens has a substantial amount of glare compared to the other brands I own, which further adds to the discomfort. I ordered mine in the tortoise frame. Aside from having rough edges, this frame ought to be discontinued because light from overhead light fixtures glares through the frame in rainbow colors, interfering with my vision.

Glare with or without the glasses was the same. True test, I couldn't see into the water beyond the surface. 2) Fit of temples was tight against my head even though the glasses measure wide. 3) Hinges were OK, but nothing that looked like they would hold up with years of wearing. I have RayBans that I've used for 20+ years, and these BNUS glasses don't compare. I concluded these are satisfactory glasses that come in a fancy cloth bag and fancy box with a cleaning cloth.

Almost on par with but not quite as distortion free as my Ray-Bans and Maui Jim's . Plan on using this pair as my ocean fishing suglasses. I have current pair of Costas which are over priced and over rated. These seem just as good and if not better because there are no rubber pieces to wear off on the nose bridge which all Costas do over time.Would have given it 4 stars but one important design flaw..... they use solid hinges no Springs after a while these are bound to break with constant on and off.

I also hated that they weren't UV ray protected. Isn't that the reason we buy sunglasses, to protect our eyes from the damaging rays from the sun??

See picture attached, you be the judge if they are mirrored like the picture that the Manufacture provided. 2. The first line under the product description said ""HD Polarized"". Well, that line of the description is not accurate. The manufacture claims that the lenses are HD. That is not true. They are polarized and that's it. Only 5 of the 11 different styles are labeled with a ""Not Mirrored"" in the color description. With the exception of the yellow color lenses, all of the other colored lens pictures show a MIRRORED lens. Even the ones that are labeled ""Not Mirrored"" I'm pretty sure this is not legal.

They look great, the packaging I received them in portrayed professionalism, and I got a lot of compliments on them. I have had them for 3 months and they are broken beyond repair. This was the final let down of a few that I will list from the time of purchase until now. When I first received these 3 months ago, I opened them up and was blown away by the packaging and all the little extras they give you. I quickly noticed that one of the screws connecting the plastic frames to the wood was not as far in as the other side. I attributed this to a lack of or slip in quality control and they still felt sturdy and seemed to work as intended so I looked past it and started using them and went on my way. Fast forward a month and I noticed there is (what I assume to be a polarization sticker) a layer of something on the lenses that is starting to lift at the edges of the lenses. It was noticeable and I wondered how many times I was looking people in the eyes with them on and they have noticed it. This continued to get slightly worse and more noticeable as time went on. Fast forward to the 2 month mark and this is when I noticed the wood on the right side where the screw was sticking out slighty is now much looser than the other side. No problem, this happens with any pair of glasses over time, I just need to tighten the screw. Well when I go to tighten the screw, it doesn't budge. It seems like its locked in place. So instead I plan on loosening the screw to then try tightening it back down. Well when I started to turn the screw to loosen it mind you, not tighten, the metal attached to the plastic frames that has a small hole for the screw to go into breaks off. Thus rendering the sunglasses now unusable. I give them 1 star because I love the way these look and another star because they kept my eyes comfortable in the sun and because of the affordable price which I guess probably ends up being their downfall.

Both the lenses and the front frame of the glasses are extremely poor quality and sizing is a bit small. The lenses throw off a lot of glare both front and back.

ItÂ’s been about 3 weeks and yesterday when trying to open them up to put them on the front part of the frame completely broke off and the right side of the frame broke into two.,74151,4607,4608,0,"Update: Changing my rating to 1, cuz these get scratched up very very very easily, and one scratched, the view is horrible, and distorted. Can't even keep them on for 5 mins, before I start feeling dizzish. Despite the seller description that these are scratch resistant, and distortion free, these are not!! Also, these glasses are smudge magnets, and hard to stay clean.I'll give it a 3.5. Will update later if it holds well overtime. Feels very light in hand, borderline flimsy. Not a great feel wearing it. Doesn't fall off. Medium will not fit most males, but would be a perfect fit for females with faces on the smaller side. I would recommend ordering a Larger size.It's good for what you pay for.",74152,4610,4611,0,"I have owned many many polarized sunglasses. From cheap wal-mart glasses to Maui Jim's and Ray-Bans.These lenses are the worst I have ever used. I didn't think twice about buying ""cheap"" polarized glasses because even wal-mart lenses were fine and provided no major issues. These lenses on the other hand are terrible. They are much darker than a normal lens, they cause different light to be let through with small changes in head position such that the sky almost looks like a hologram switching from nearly white to dark blue based on small head movements.Every other pair of polarized sunglass lenses I have worn provide a nice clean filter of polarized light where every color ""pops"". These are the polar opposite (no pun intended). Everything looks murky and inconsistent. Frames are also cheap feeling but that was expected based on price. The lens issues were not expected.",74153,4612,4613,1,"First of all, the glasses do block blue light and it comes with a little blue flashlight and blue-sensitive card to prove it. What's interesting is that my regular UV coated glasses do block a lot of the blue light already using the same test, but these glasses add another 15% to around 90%.Everything else about the glasses is horrendous. Everything about these glasses is cheap. The plastic frames look and feel like those 3D throw-away glasses you get at the theater. The lens is the cheapest quality so as you wear these glasses, the image is a little blurry as if you're looking through a piece of plastic from a soda bottle. It seems the ONLY coating on these lens is for blue-blocking without any other like oleophopic so they are extremely prone to smudges from the oil on your hands and face. Wearing the glasses too close to your face will cause your eyelashes to brush against the inner part of the lens and smudge it. You'll have to wipe the lens several times a day.The most horrendous aspect of these glasses is that they're totally flat. If your head is shaped like a brick, then these will fit nicely. If you're like most people with a contoured profile, these glasses will leave a huge gap on the sides of your face, so what effectively happens is that the ambient light will actually reflect off the inner, edge-side of the lens and cause GLARE. As I wear these glasses to look at the computer, I actually see additional glare from the reflection on the inner side of the lens. It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.",74154,4613,4614,0,"I spend a lot of time working on my laptop or looking at my phone, so I figured a pair of these blue light blocking glasses would be useful. Once I received the glasses, which were packaged nicely in a white cardboard box, which a little tough to pry open, I saw a magnetic glasses case with the glasses nicely wrapped in an opaque sleeve with a lens cleaning cloth in a clear sleeve. I took the glasses out of their packaging and picked them up, only to feel that they were incredibly light and thin to the extent that they feel fragile and flimsy. They feel as if they're easy to break, especially if dropped. When I put them on, the first thing I noticed was that the frame fits really well and doesn't compress or add much pressure to the face, but there was a part of the lenses, especially the right one, where I couldn't see much. When I was wearing the glasses, I couldn't see through the top left and the top right of the left and right lenses, respectively, because there were blue dots blocking my vision. I took them off to carefully observe why I couldn't see through those parts of those lenses, only to see that the top parts of both lenses, especially the right lens, had this layer that was peeling off, like when there is an anti-reflective coating put on your glasses, but over time, it starts to peel and leaves this trail where it peeled off. Basically, I can't see too well through the top half of the lenses unless I tilt my head because of the peeled off layer on the lenses.I did try to take pictures of the peeling coatings on the lenses as soon as I saw them, but they weren't showing up on a camera. It's too bad. I really hoped I could show the defects.",74155,4614,4615,0,So the blue light they send with the testing card is a gimmick I totally fell for from other reviews. Â“Wow if they send a blue light AND the card to prove their glasses work they must REALLY work rightÂ”? Nope. Well they do filter the light they send but they donÂ’t really filter blue light AND donÂ’t filter any better than wearing sunglasses and only marginally better than my regular glasses. Sending these ones right back.,74156,4615,4616,0,"I loved the look of the frames on these glasses, however, when I wore them for the first time, after a few minutes I developed a headache. I thought it was just me so I kept wearing them for a little while longer. The headache got worse, so I took them off. When I took them off, my headache went away. I tried this several more times throughout two days. I compared them to my other blue light blocking glasses and I didn't have a headache when I wore my other pair of a different brand. I did noticed that the glass had a weird film on them. Almost looked like an oil slick rainbow type effect when put in the light and the plastic glass just did not look high quality. I gave them a fair shot, I really wanted them to work, but I ended up returning them after a few days.",74157,4616,4617,0,"I spend a LOT of time on the computer, hence my purchase of a very high-resolution monitor that delivers sharp images with no shadowing or blurring. These ANRRI glasses looked promising upon opening the package ... attractive, seemingly well-made. I took off my current +1.75 computer readers (great glasses, excellent image, but getting worn and scratched) and put the ANRRI glasses on only to find out that at ANY distance from the monitor, I was looking at blurry, ghosted images. I could not achieve a clear image no matter what I tried. I have never encountered this issue with magnifying readers before, computer glasses or otherwise. These are going back.

About these for kids so they can use with prescription lenses but these frames are made for fashion not for actual glasses prescription unless it's a very mild prescription. They are not made like medical glasses that need a screw to hold in the lens. Just a heads up this did not have that screw. These are mainly for Cosmetic fashion purposes.,74161,4621,4622,1,"Broke after 3 weeks of using them.Be aware that not all the optical labs will work with them to change the plastic glass for prescription purposes. Why? The plastic is pretty cheap. Basically, they told me that if the lab work with them will probably broke due to the quality of the plastic (apparently they use some air-pressure process). Fortunately, I found a lab that took off the plastic part and worked with them, only with the metal frame. However, they were really concerned about the quality of the product aaaand guess what? They were right.For the price, the product is good and they look pretty good too (Received a lot of compliments of and for them), but I will not recommend this product for prescription purposes. My vision is blurry AF so now I'm screwed for a couple of days.",74162,4622,4623,0,"The glasses fit really well (I have a big head). I looked how they looked on my face, but I could see my eyelids in the reflection of the interior lenses. I tried them originally indoors under the kitchen lights and then waited for the morning to test them outside. The reflection is too much to bare. I returned them. Keep in mind, this was with the blue lenses.",74163,4623,4624,1,Don't waste your money I bought an equivalent pair at Wally World and they were better quality than these. The frame that goes around your ear is kind of flimsy rubbery and the lenses are warped as you can see in the pictures. This is definitely noticeable when you turn your head side to side or up and down. I tried putting the lens back to lay flat and I couldn't.,74164,4624,4625,1,"These sunglasses look great, though the lines are a bit severe. The problem is the poor quality of the earpieces. The screws that hold them on constantly loosen with only occasional opening and closing. Additionally, each earpiece is held on with two screws. The first time I tried to tighten them, one was already stripped and simply went around and around. I started avoiding opening and closing the earpieces by simply leaving them already opened in my car. That worked for several months. Then I took them with me on a trip to France in June 2019. Within days, one of the earpieces had come off and its screw lost. I went to a discount store and replaced them with a pair that cost 1 euro (about $1.20). They were if anything slightly more stylish and though obviously flimsy seemed of nearly equivalent quality, except on these the screws did not loosen. Bottom line: not worth the money. Go to the supermarket or drug store and buy a pair for half the price or less.",74165,4625,4626,2,This is the second pair of these sunglasses I have ordered. The first pair was fine but they cracked at the top after 6-8 months of daily wear. At $12.00 there is nothing really to complain about. So I bought another pair and wore them on a recent road trip. After 5 hours of driving I took the glasses off and the bridge of my nose was black. The plastic dye must have came off on my nose. It continues to do so after wearing them any length of time. This might be an isolated incident or a quality issue with this pair alone. Not sure if I would buy again.,74166,4626,4627,0,For the price these are nearly unbeatable. They look stylish and come with a case/tools. I appreciate that they are polarized and have decently lenses BUT my particular pair has a smudge that seems to be a manufacturing defect on the left lens right where you look through. While it is distracting its not a deal breaker. Yes i have cleaned them with proper solution and a microfiber cleaning cloth and the smudge/imperfection remains.

IÂ’ve tried soap and hand sanitizer but it wonÂ’t come off! IÂ’m so disappointed I had to walk around with stained blue nails.Another thing I didnÂ’t like was the sizing. I ordered an XS and the shirt still looked HUGE on me. You can see it more in person as I walk.Both the pants and shirt felt pretty stiff and cheap.If youÂ’re going to be using these scrubs often or for long periods of time I DO NOT recommend them!!

The only other thing that was wonderful about them was the price ( in this case you get what you pay for).The Cons:The fabric was coming apart at every seam after washing it once!! And IÂ’m talking about EVERY ONE before I ever even wore them! Aside from some less than great stitching they seemed fine until I wore a brand new outfit to work and somehow during the course of the one day got a hole in the pants (right were a seam was... no surprise)The shirts also seem to be too large for the pants size and you canÂ’t mix/match the sizes for a set.I wasted $140 on these trying to save a few bucks but it looks like now IÂ’ll be going with brands I know AND be stuck with sewing these together as long as possible.DonÂ’t make my mistake and just go buy the damn good ones...For picture reference IÂ’m 5Â’9 and 140lbs.",74171,4631,4632,0,"I just received this on Purple. I bought a burgundy set last week in Medium. Loved the fit and decided to get the purple one, too. Also purple. The burgundy arrived neatly pressed and folded in a plastic package.

I can't get this purple scrub top on. It's too tight. The difference may seem slight but it's significant when you need that extra space for a slightly larger chest and not look baggy or too tight.

Not worth your time and effort. Sitting with xxxx lg pant that do not fit and are way too long. Shame on the seller. IÂ’m tired of buying items online and having to return. ItÂ’s defeating the purpose of not shopping in stores. They need to keep the stores open so people can go and try and buy instead of online store who knowingly sell people items that are way too big. IÂ’m one angry online shopper. And to know that I bought more than three to make my life easier. No it made my life hell.

People mostly think IÂ’m just average sized, because IÂ’m really not that short. But I ended up buying the petite small pair anyway, since I know a lot of pants end up being too long for me. Even the petite sized scrub pants are too long. They definitely drag on the floor, which wouldnÂ’t be too much of an issue if the waist band was actually elastic and hugged my waist enough. I could have hitched these up a little higher and it would have been fine except the waist is too big too!

I ordered another pair recently in medium in black instead of the navy and it is huge. It may be mislabeled as it fits like a large would. I have not lost weight. I have washed it several times thinking maybe it would shrink a little, but it still fits like clown pants. The only way I can wear it and have them stay up is to safety pin the waist.

I wore these scrub pants for one 12 hour shift. I am an RN and need to be walking a lot for the job. Out of the bag, these pants felt scratchy. I am aware these are inexpensive pants and not the greatest material. I had no idea what was to come. I get to work and things are fine for the first few hours. I start to notice my thighs are irritated. I knew it was the pants, but chose to just suck it up. Well, 8 hours into my 12 hour shift, I'm miserable. My skin is on fire. I went to the supply room to grab gauze to wrap around my thighs. Once I'm in the bathroom to put the gauze on, I look at my skin. My inner thighs were bright red and covered in raised splotches.

It became a 3/4 sleeve shirt and too short in the torso. Just add it to the stack of shirts that I'll only wear if I'm desperate.

And I knew ordering these scrubs was straight up gambling. After reading so many mixed reviews, I decided to purchase two pairs and see for myself. If they fit, great. If they didn't, at least I could write an honest review for the XS size. The pants definitely run long, but they're not completely unreasonable. I found that if I rolled the waist up once, they weren't terrible. In fact, I will probably end up wearing the pants to work. The reason I have rated one star is for the top alone. These are in no way, shape, or form, extra small sized. Everything about the top felt like a large. I consider myself to have relatively average proportions for my height and weight. The length of the top could cause it to classify as a mini dress. The width was very potato sack-like. I'm pretty sure they held the measuring tape upside down.

They are complete high water pants and donÂ’t come down enough to your shoes!! I wear XS in all scrub pants, but this brand makes the extra small extra short! IÂ’m 5Â’5Â” so IÂ’m of average height... I had to buy a size small just to get the length right. However, the small are ridiculously baggy! And the weird slit at the bottom of the pant legs doesnÂ’t do anything but make them look super weird! I wear a size 5 in jeans, regular length. IÂ’m 120 lbs, if that helps. Also: the pockets are so dysfunctionally high up on the pants that theyÂ’re hard to use! The only positive is the soft material: it feels really nice. For the brand, price, and the hype, though: these are terrible! I would not recommend. Two stars are literally just for the cozy material only, not the fit or function.",74194,4656,4657,0,They are supposed to be straight leg but have a little flare to them and hang too long compared to my store bought GAs. I think the person who sewed them was drunk. The left cargo pocket was sewn shut. There was only one bead on one draw string and no bead for the other. The zippered pocket is ridiculous. It's too small to fit anything in. Its vertical so anything you put in falls out before you get it zipped. For me I felt like they were made for a left handed person because I had no place to put my cell phone because I had to cross my body to put it in my Left cargo pocket.,74195,4657,4658,2,"It purchased this pair of scrubs thinking ""these are Dickies, should be an awesome product"" when they came in they fit as expected and were super comfortable but two hours into the shift the rear end ripped and not at a seam about and inch in from the rear pocket all the up to the belt loop down to the top of the thigh., Thank goodness I keep a spare set of scrubs in my locker. Horrible, disappointing product , when I looked at the ripped area, it wasn't stressed. or on a seam. Returned them and wouldn't buy another.",74196,4660,4661,0,"These scrubs are the most low-rise pair I have ever owned. Scrubs are supposed to be functional clothing, meant for working and moving around in. These scrubs rested just above my butt crack and dared me to move in them. If I bent my upper body more the 20 degrees, my butt was making an appearance. Working in the hospital at a respectable job is just not the time or place to display a butt crack. I know they say they are ""junior fit"", but Dickies took it a little far. I returned them promptly for a more suitable style of Wonder Wink scrubs.Had these fit better, I think I would have liked them. There are a number of pockets and I felt like I was wearing pants that doubled as a utility belt. I swear there was a loop to hang my (non-existent) hammer. I don't know what else it could be for, but I liked it. I liked the excess of pockets and storage. Nurses are basically like Batman in regard to all of the tools and supplies they keep in their pockets during a work day.

I bought the small based on the charted waist size but I could have gone to XS. I bought the regular length because I prefer to take in the ends myself.What I don't like about these pants is how WIDE the legs are! I look like I'm ready to rap when I put them on. It's really odd.I have a sewing machine so I was able to take off about two inches of the fabric along the inseam and now it looks more like normal pants.I like the stitching details. The fabric is a bit thinner than I expected but comfortable.,74198,4662,4663,1,"I have two pairs of these in different colors I ordered from uniform sales. I love the way they fit and don't wrinkle. Against my better judgment, I ordered online. I went for the petite because the Large regular size was a little big and a little long (I'm 5'3""), assuming the petite would be a little smaller (although it shouldn't be, as the definition of petite is 5'3"" and shorter, not smaller all around). The Large Petite pants were approximately 1-2 cm shorter, but were a FULL size or even size and a half smaller! Why is it that companies assume that shorter also means smaller? I'm keeping them it's too much of a pain to return them, and they are wearable, just not comfortably. Just beware the sizing.",74199,4663,4664,0,"I've ordered these scrubs in the past and loved them. I've had my previous pairs for 4+ years and they've held up great. I recently ordered again and was very disappointment that they've changed the design. The waistband used to be a super comfortable stretchy band. The material in the waist appears to be the same but they have added a strip of material inside that is NOT STRETCHY AT ALL. As a result they are not quite as comfortable. They barely stretch enough for me to pull them over my hips, once on my waist they are OK. I really loved the product before and wish they would not have changed it. The strip of material is sewed in with a tight double stitch otherwise I would attempt to remove it. I didn't realize this until after washed, otherwise I probably would have sent them back. They fit true to size, I'm 5'4"" and 120 pounds and wear a small top and small bottom.",74200,4664,4665,1,"These are very comfy scrub pants, but I'm not overly impressed by the pockets and the length is a problem for me. I ordered a sz XS petite, as that is what I wear for pretty much every brand of scrub pants - but I have to be cautious because not all petites are ""truly"" petites, or at least not short enough for me. I'm 4'10"" 114 lbs and muscular, but I'm pretty leggy proportionally. I marked these under ""fit as expected"" since otherwise, the sizing is good. These pants are just slightly too long, and I think it's because of how flared they are at the bottom. I thought that because the inseam length is the same as other petite scrub pants that have fit me will, these would be fine, but the bell-bottom like thing these pants have going on at the bottom seems to be the issue. Even with these pants pulled up as high as they go (thank god my scrub tops are a bit long for me, because these pants make my crotch look super weird and camel-toe ish) the bottoms of these pants are trailing the ground with my sneakers on. Very annoying, I will have to get them hemmed now. I was hoping for a little more out of these pants, they aren't exactly the fancy expensive ones but they are more $$ than say Cherokee's iFlex line (which I will be sticking with from now on!) and now I have to spend more money finding someone to hem them. Also, the ONE mid-thigh pocket it has is kind of short. On one hand, I like that my pens wont get lost and i wont have to go digging for things, but there should really be more than one. the upper front pockets are not roomy enough to be useful...they are fine length and with wise, but unless you buy a size that would be rather loose on your thighs and butt, you're not going to fit anything useful in there. Same goes for the butt pockets...they're rather small and I'm not really sure what I would bother to put in there. Also would like to say that these are perhaps a little low rise for my taste. Like I said, I have a really short torso...so many pants that aren't mid-rise are going to be mid-rise on me. These are not.

When I received the pants they were extremely small in the waist and length. I thought it was weird that one size up is falling off my waist and one size down is skin tight.

IÂ’ve never had a regular length be too short. Even the black color and material are different than the original. I could never wear the original top and new pants together.

I bought the XL Petite. The fit is that funky dip in butt I hate, the back of the waistband is lower than the front so it constantly gives the feeling that your pants are sliding down. If you have a flat bottom, this may not bother you. The length though is perfect wish they sat at the waist more equally, the pull string at waist is not needed as they have elastic. The legs are very narrow, which would be great if you are shaped that way, I am not and the seam around the leg just accentuates the awkward tightness. These have nice fabric and color, the pockets are nice, I may look at other cuts by this company. The 2 stars is only for the length and fabric.",74205,4670,4671,2,"In the past I have ordered these scrubs and absolutely loved them. I am supremely disappointed with my most recent order. Since I have several pairs of these scrubs, I am familiar with how size runs and fit of this product. The Pewter scrubs I ordered this time are sized as large, but fit more like a medium. They are way too snug compared to other orders. I also ordered an electric purple pair that also fit a little differently. I am unhappy with the pewter scrub pants, due to complete change in fit. It;s almost when they were sewing in tags,they were mistagged. I will hesitate to order these scrub pants in the future.",74206,4671,4672,0,"I was ordering for my office staffs, probably I need to order more than 50 sets.

IÂ’m 5Â’2 and theyÂ’re perfect so if youÂ’re 5Â’2 or maybe even 5Â’1 these will hit your ankles no doubt. Only issue I have with these (these would be so freaking amazing if not for this) is the drawstring is like half FAKE. like what?? It only pulls together the front half of the waistband and the back isnÂ’t even attached to the drawstring. ItÂ’s so bizarre like so these are too loose on top and i donÂ’t think a regular large will fit my thighs. IÂ’m regularly a 16 and I have a smaller waist and larger hips like an hourglass and it just doesnÂ’t fit me very well. I love them but if you have a smaller waist these might be hard to fit since the drawstring is completely worthless.,74210,4675,4676,2,"I am 5'7, an athletic 140 pounds, and purchased these pants in an x-small tall. I wear a size 26 in Joe's jeans, generally a 2-4 in Gap, Banana Republic, j.crew, etc.I have a small waist and quite large legs and have purchased at least 5 pairs of HeartSoul scrub pants in the past, that I have loved, always an x-small tall. I do not generally order on line but I thought since I had repurchased many times from this company I knew what I was getting myself into.Somehow the waist on these pants is still too large, significantly so; I believe that is mainly due to the bizarre waist band. In addition, there is not enough tautness/hold to properly tuck in a top, which I find irritating and the strings do not tighten the waist band at all. They just seem to be there to come untied and bother me. The thighs are a liiiiiitle tight but not uncomfortably so, I have felt like this brand usually stretches out by the end of the shift which is why in spite of my weight, my standard size is an x-small. I think it is definitely noticeable around my bum but again I think that is a me problem, not an everyone problem. Overall I would say that somehow these pants fit both too small and too large. Which is annoying.I thought potentially the pants were a little too long, but looking at the provided pictures, I think mine actually fit pretty similarly. I think the model is a bit slimmer than me (obviously) and so they lay a little nicer on her.The fabric of these pants is standard for the Heart Soul line, they are sort-of ""swishy"" which I enjoy because I feel like it wicks better and doesn't show sweat or spills of any sort easily. I work in the ER so we have our fair share of spills. Also the fabric doesn't attract lint/hair/dust like the usual cotton scrubs do and because I wear black scrubs most of the time I appreciate that.Overall I have a lot of mixed emotions about these pants. The style is cute, the fit is strange, fabric is great, waistband is...kindof awful?I would return or exchange them for potentially a small regular length, but my neighbor stole this package and wouldn't give me my pants until I showed her I had proof she nabbed it off my doorstep. Unfortunately she didn't open the package in a manner that made the envelope reusable.I'm going to wear for a shift and update review accordingly, with photos.",74211,4676,4677,1,So I brought these pants looking for a jogger style scrub for work. I ordered a pair of sm petite first since I am in between sm and med. For the small it fit me snug and little short for the leg I am 5'1 and the waist was ok. But I went ahead and ordered a med since I felt they would shrink. The med petite was fine the material is comfortable but the waist was big. The drawstring is just for show they do not tighten which sucks. Also the pant is a little short and for me and I use petite on almost everything. These pants wouldn't have been bad if the waist actually tightened and for the price they are kind of expensive so save your money.,74212,4677,4678,0,"I dinged off two more stars after I received my smaller size.

The blue ones fit, and the black ones were too small. I returned the black ones and ordered a small (instead of the usual extra small) to make up for them being so small. When they came, they were too big! I had already removed the tags too. I'm guessing the first ones were a factory defect, and the second ones were true to size (just not MY size).

The knee stitching is also different and sits a little bit higher on the knee than the legit pants. Long story short, I'm going to keep the ones that I bought at a discount because the fabric is still nice and I think they are worth that price with the irregularities. However, I would not pay full price for these so I'm returning the first pair I bought.

I ordered one size larger than I normally wear and I feel like I am putting on spanks. They bind and I can't move but I bought them to be an under layer for winter wear. These will end up going to someone else who is a smaller size. Very disappointed even after checking the sizing chart I ordered a 2x and I normally wear a 1x in women's clothing and they still didn't fit. Not worth the time and effort to send back but I certainly don't recommend them. If it says it is a woman's 2x it should fit like it is that size.

I know there's a lot of discussion about the multiple manufacturing sites, mine was made in Haiti, if that helps anyone out.I bought a small when I'm usually a medium (after a few washes) in these type of cheaper shirts (Hanes, FTL, etc.) because everyone said they run large. This is only partly true. The shirt was VERY long. I'm 5' 10"" and the small came to my mid thigh. The sleeves were big and billowy around the bicep and super tight around the forearm and cuff. I'm not a huge guy, but a small should NEVER be too big on me. It honestly felt like three different shirts combined, somehow. The material was also pretty rough. I don't think fabric softener would have done anything to make this shirt more comfortable.I like Carhartt as a brand and know that they have some goods at higher price points that will last a lifetime. This shirt, or at least some of them, aren't getting the kind of attention their jackets and pants receive. Stay away or go find it at your local Army Surplus store to make sure you're not wasting your time.",74228,4693,4694,2,"I am very disappointed with this shirt and am returning it without even bothering to try it on.I own this exact shirt in this exact color that I have owned for several years. My older shirt is made of much heavier fabric than the new one I received today.I read a number of other negative reviews here that mention the Haiti manufacturing facility as being the source of the poorly made shirts and low quality fabric. From what I learned today about the Ash color, XL, Carhartt Men's Workwear Midweight Jersey Pocket Long-Sleeve T-Shirt, I have to agree.I purchased two of these shirts. One Ash and one Black. Both are inferior to the Ash colored XL that I currently own. I'll list the facts which confirm to me the poorer quality of the fabric in the new version.My original Ash colored shirt- Made in Honduras | 99% cotton/ 1% polyester | Weighs 424gm/15ozNew Black colored shirt- Made in Guatemala | 100% cotton | Weighs 402gm/14.2oz is slightly larger and was weighed with tags and stickers still attached.New Ash colored shirt- Made in Haiti | 99% cotton/ 1% polyester | Weighs 384gm/13.5oz is slightly larger and was weighed with tags and stickers still attached.The fabric on the Ash/Haiti version was very coarse to the touch and practically see through when held up toward a light across the room and is immediately noticeably, thin.The fabric on the Black/Guatemala version was ok, but not great and I hope it softens up in the wash. It blocked a fair amount of the light when held up but was still noticeably thinner than my older shirt.My Ash/Honduras version is, obviously softer after years of washing, but blocks most of the light when held up and feels thick and substantial.I am returning the Ash/Haiti version because it is such poor quality and had it been my first ever Carhartt shirt I would assume that the brand was over-hyped and made crappy workwear.I will keep the Black/Guatemala version and wear it around for a while before deciding whether or not to keep it or send it back. Regardless, both of these shirts were a big let down and the quality is not what they used to be.Both of the newer shirts ran larger than sized and even with all that additional fabric, as compared to my other shirt, still weighed in at 1-1.5 ounces lighter even including all the cardboard tags and stickers.FYI: After many, many years buying from Amazon, this is the first review I've ever written. That should tell you something about how negatively I view this product; Carhartt Men's Workwear Midweight Jersey Pocket Long-Sleeve T-Shirt.",74229,4694,4695,0,"I bought this shirt (made in Haiti) and one other in a different color. (Blue) made in Mexico. I can't believe how thin the material is in them. Not the carhartt quality I had come to know over the years. I always bought carhartt shirts and products because of how nice and thick the material was. I wanted the same in this long sleeve shirt for warmth. Not the case at all, and way too big. I put this shirt on over another long sleeve shirt with a short sleeve t shirt under that, and it still hung 6 - 8 inches below my waist. Im about 6 ft 190 & these T's are too big. I still may have lived with that , knowing they will likely shrink over time, but it is so cheaply made there is no way im keeping it. I bought a gildan at the same time for $6.40 and I can honestly say the quality of that shirt is at very least as good as these carhartt shirts. Carhartt is charging $20 to $40. I'm guessing its because they are now selling their logo now more then a quality product. I don't leave many comments here on Amazon but I've never felt so disappointed about something. Carhartt seems to be following others like Nike etc, who made a great name for themselves because they made great products, then got greedy and no longer care about the quality only the logo. Sending both shirts back, and going to a department store where i can see and feel the quality of what I'm buying. This is one problem I see with the future of Amazon. Quality will go down because companies (like Carhartt) will bank on the fact that many will not take time to return items or write reviews. Get with it Carhartt or I'm taking my business elsewhere. I added some pictures here. I hung these shirts against a sliding glass window with the sun behind to show how thin they are. As a comparison, I hung a 5 year old carhartt short sleeve shirt (blue) that has been washed and dried dozens and dozens of times. It is still thicker then the brand new shirt that I just received. I also took pics of the white $20 carhartt and the 6.40 competitor shirt. Yes, the carhartt has a pocket. But the material is terrible. Not paying $15 xtra dollars for a pocket. There is also one picture showing how huge it fits.",74230,4695,4696,0,"I usually wear an XL...this runs large and a size Large fits great. I like the look of this shirt...however the material is a ""softer"" tee and I'm not certain it will hold up like my old Carhartt's. The neck started to ""pill"" after a half dozen times of wearing.Bottom line: The quality seems to have dropped off significantly.Updated on 4-2-18: I'm changing my rating to a one star after wearing it and washing it a half-dozen times. The entire shirt has ""pilled"" with the heaviest pilling around the neck. I own a number of Carhartt long sleeve tees and this one is a very big disappointment. A total waste of money...I guess I could change the oil in my car with it...",74231,4696,4697,0,"I purchased 2 of these in L knowing they fit a little big. 1 in black and 1 in navy. The black one (made in Haiti) fit perfect. It is made from the heavy material and feels awesome. The blue one (made in Honduras) was still too big. The material is thinner. I'll rate the black one a 5 star but why is Carhartt doing this to its customers? I've been a life long Carhartt fan but I'm starting to veer away. When Dickies is starting to compete in quality with a lower cost it's probably time to reassess your product. Put the effort back in to your quality Carhartt and quit riding on the fact you made a good name for yourself. Frustrating. To help other consumers I'm 6' 210 with a normal/athletic build. I'm not all cut up but I'm not flabby either. I like clothes to fit. Not draped over me and not stuck to my body. Hope this helps!

The majority of my time is spent in the office but I do have to go out in the shop regularly which requires me to wear steel toe shoes. I decided to give these a try. The fit well and were very comfortable throughout the workday. My biggest issue is the exterior soles wore out in about four months. And that's with walking less than 6000 steps per day. I have to say I'm rather disappointed. I was hoping they would last at least 6-8 months. I can't recommend these.,74236,4701,4702,0,"I ordered this and it took about 6 weeks to get here.

I'm in Europe for the semester and wear these everywhere: climbing rock formations, wandering cobblestone streets, through mud and puddles and they've been great. EXCEPT I only bought them less than six months ago and they've only been consistently worn for the last two and a half and they're falling apart. The zipper on one broke off and the material is coming apart from the sole on the other.

I received them and they looked and felt great when I tried them on! The small zippers did not open smoothly so I never really messed with them because I didn't have a use for the little pockets the couple times I did wear them. Long story short: the motorcycle my husband brought home needed work and sat for almost a year in our garage while my boots sat for just as long in my closet without being worn! This Spring he got the bike working and after not even 5 rides, I went to put the boots on and the main zipper COMPLETELY BROKE. I sent in pictures to the company and explained the situation and even contacted amazon with no resolve, which is such a bummer. These boots are CHEAPLY made if the zipper busts off after just a few uses. I would not recommend this product.",74239,4705,4706,1,"These were great the first 2 months of LIGHT use, but they have no durability. I recently took a 3 week trip abroad and they could not stand up to the test.

And they are MOST DEFINITELY NOT water tight. You step into one puddle and your socks are soaked. The sole of the shoe right under the ball of my foot split open, so now ALL water gets into the sole. Do NOT buy these shoes, they are a waste of money. So after 4 months these are completely useless.

When I put them on (I ordered up a size because they are boots, if I hadn't they still would not have fit) they were just a bit too big, I needed a half size. There was no cushion, at all. No arch support, it almost seemed like it actually sloped down in that area. The calf was snug, I am not sure it would have worked had I tucked my pants into them (I am plus size). The worst part of the boot was the ankle. It was huge and puffed out when I stood up. I am so disappointed in the boot and the reviews.

The eyelet completely broke which is supposed to be made of shoe fabric as well. I have only worn these for work and nothing else. I also always untie them instead of sliding them off.

I have found glue seeping into one of the slots for credit cards. As a result, it became almost impossible to remove a credit card because the glue had secured it to the slot.

The wallet I wanted to purchase is on the right. I would have to say I have been ripped off. I would also have to say this is false advertising.

It looked good, fit all my cards, and the money clip was nice and tight whether it was a single bill or 20. After 4 weeks of use I can't say I'm happy with the non-magnetic clip for 3 reasons.1. I attempted to remove a credit card I don't use very often located closest to the clip and it wouldn't come out even with the use of needle nose pliers. I removed the clip from the wallet and only then was i able to remove the card still using pliers.2. The clip was so tight that it tore my bills when i was attempting to remove them.3. The clip has slowly been putting a hole in the back pocket of my jeans over the past few weeks.My recommendation would be to get the magnetic clip. The wallet itself holds a lot, compact, and stylish. If it wasn't for the non-magnetic clip I would have definitely given this product 5 stars.",74282,4756,4757,0,"So I just got my wallet and so far I am not impressed. First of all, it advertises that it can hold 20 folded bills with the magnet, but mine canÂ’t hold any more than 10 if I vigorously shake it. Maybe that is just the magnet I got, I donÂ’t know. Also it advertises that it blocks RFID, but in the description it says it does not block RFID signals. Also I got the black leather one and I have opened the money clip maybe 10 times and it is already starting to get a fold mark below where the magnet is, so with that and based off of some other reviews I read, IÂ’m not too confident the wallet will last very long, especially if I have to keep prying open the pockets to get to my cards because it is so tight. I also feel like by using this wallet I am risking destroying my credit cards because of the magnet. Other than all those negatives, I like the look and light weight of the wallet, it could be a little less wide to make sliding it in and out of my pocket easier, but I canÂ’t complain because I believe itÂ’s width is actually as advertised.",74283,4757,4758,0,"ItÂ’s a nice wallet but it doesnÂ’t block RFID.

The biggest issue I found to be the 3 card slots did a poor job of keeping cards in their respective pockets, without the cards wiggling out and about. Leather quality was good and seam stitching as well, but not a wallet I'd recommend. Also a bit too thick to truly be what I would consider a front pocket wallet, especially when wearing jeans.",74285,4759,4760,2,"I bought 2 wallets and got really dissapointed.First of all it is not real Leather... this description is incorrect... maybe is PU Leather but it is not real leather.Second: I've tried both of them trying to see if the RFID blocker works... and guess what?

It has six credit card slots but only one is big enough to hold a credit card and the rest are too tight and too narrow to hold a regular credit card.

The problem with this garbage wallet is apparent as soon as you put your credit cards and I.D. inside--everything is too small. The 6 credit card slots are grouped so close together the cards are right on top of each other making them impossible to easily remove and put back or even tell which card you are pulling out. The design also maintains too much steady pressure on the credit cards in the slots warping them. The driver's license slot is also too small making it very difficult to remove your identification if you need to hand it to a clerk. Avoid this awful product.",74290,4765,4766,1,"I was very disappointed in this product. The wallet itself is extremely thick, even when empty. It is uncomfortable to put in your pocket.

In the product pictures, you see staggered card slots. However, the actual wallet itself does not stagger the cards at all!!! Look at the pictures I posted. You can see that the cards are stuffed in the same height! This means the outermost card(green) is the easiest to remove. The other 2 cards are almost un-removable unless you remove the top card(s). This is the most inconvenient design I have ever seen in a wallet. Seriously, to get to card 2 or 3, I have to remove the top cards? What kind of design is this?I'll try out the wallet, but I doubt I'll use it for long. Unless of course, you are a user who only uses 1 or 2 cards, then it won't be inconvenient for you.The material itself is good though, soft smooth feel and it's light.

First, there was lint everywhere with cheap cardboard/paper inserts in the wallet that looked super cheap. Second, it just feels...the hand feel just does't feel right. Even though it's supposed to be genuine leather, the pebbling felt more like styrofoam? Something about it just didn't feel right to me.I gave it to my dad anyway because his money was at risk of falling out of his last wallet. Plus, with how cheap this was, i think i pretty much got what I paid for lol. I am going to let him live with this wallet for now, and when i get around to going shopping, i'm going to keep an eye out for a nicer wallet.

The slide mechanism works like it should, comes with 2 money bands but it's better to use it with out the leather casing (kind of damaged the leather getting the band on and taking it off) Also the cards will stay put in the wallet even if you flip it upside down, you would have to shake it like crazy to have the cards slide out. Even if you only had one card in the slot it wont come out. The cons I have with this wallet is the slide mechanism does not push your cards as far as the picture shows which kind of sucks. It serious pushes them like 1 centimeter a part. One of the pockets on the leather casing are WAAAAAY to deep, I end up getting some money stuck in there it took awhile to get it out. I also got some threading that's coming off already which is a bummer when I only had it a week. Over all it's ok if you carry small amounts of cash and about 6 cards it's good.

But this one was impossible. The slots for the cards were so narrow that I had to use an insane amount of force to get them shoved inside, and for one, I needed to grab a needlenose pliers to pull back out because it was so tight that I couldn't get enough of a grip with my fingers and thumb to pull it out again.It wasn't as thin as it seemed people made it out to be, as it was just barely thinner than my trifold wallet. It was much shorter than I would have preferred as well, so it's a very shallow spot to store bills and if they're just a little bit tilted, it sticks out the top on one side or another.I liked the looks, and could have gotten used to the rest of the issues, but those impossible to use credit card slots just ruined it.",74313,4791,4792,1,"This review is for the buyer, like me, who wants a wallet that doesn't send the message that you're homeless.It's not sturdy. I recommend that you avoid this brand and try a different one. I included pictures that show how the wallet came torn out of the box. The material on mine was so low-quality that it did not survive shipping! If your wallet comes out okay, it's likely it won't survive one season. If you look at the box, it appears you're spending more on the box for this wallet than the wallet itself. To me, that's a message from Tommy Hilfiger that says, ""We want you to think you're getting quality that you're not."" No thanks!I give this wallet two stars because it came from Amazon and saved me a trip to Walmart, which earns it forgiveness, alongside the fact that it's larger than my last Walmart brand.

According to this article, FAR less than 1% of credit cards use RFID signals so we are protecting ourselves from something that is an insignificant risk.This article also suggests that tin foil works as well as the product used in this wallet in safeguarding the less than 1% of credit cards that use the RFID signal.In addition to having purchased an inferior product poorly constructed, I feel that I've been scammed.

I kept my debit card and Freedom card in one slot and they fall out easily too.So 5 cards in addition to my license and all compartments are loose.

First off, I purchased this wallet 6-7 the months ago and today I have a different wallet (ridge wallet).

Second issue was the fact that the wallet was staining everything it held (both cards and cash). The staining was so bad that I began to become reluctant to pull a card out knowing it may stain more. Lastly, the wallet claims quick and easy card access to your main card but the card is rather difficult to pull out because it tends to slightly stick to the wallet.

I ordered this wallet last October, to replace my old one, which I had bought at a garage sale about 7 years ago for $6 and used until it was too small to hold my growing collection of credit and membership/frequent buyer cards. Decided I needed something with more slots for cards and overall more room. Picked this up for less than $15 to give it a try.Looked nice at first - smooth leather looked clean. plenty of room for credit/debit cards, though the window slot where i kept my drivers license was very tight and made it difficult to remove whenever I had to hand that to anyone (*cough cough* police officers). Wallet worked fine until last month, when I noticed a small tear beginning on the lining on the left side of the wallet. Soon after, the right side lining tore wide open from the leather, creating an opening wide enough to let anything stored in that pocket to fall out when you unfold the wallet.Unacceptable.Can't absolutely vouch for the effectiveness of the RID blocking, but I can say that - while I had this wallet - noone stole my identity or spoofed any of my cards... they just kept falling out due to the ripped lining.Replaced it last week and threw this on in the trash.Gave two stars because it is a nice looking wallet - just need to improve their quality control and enlarge the D/L slot and I think they'll have a good product.",74324,4805,4806,1,"This average quality wallet is made from genuine leather and other materials with RFID protection. The leather is thinner than I expected for this price range. I had been looking on Amazon for a reasonably priced wallet with RFID and most I saw were in the price range of $10 to $20 dollars for a bi-fold. The $10 wallets looked cheap -- patent leather cheap. What caught my eyes about the wallet I ordered from GintaXen (02 Coffee) was its beautiful and luxurious top grain texture. I could almost smell the tanning process! Most of the photos I saw of Gintaxen's line of leather wallets all showed beautifully textured and rich looking leathers. It can be rather impressive when you pull out such a great looking leather wallet to make a purchase or to show your ID. That's what I'd hope to get from GintaXen after seeing their marketing photos. But looks can be deceiving! In this case it was. The beautiful photos are the BAIT to get you hooked. After that it's the luck of the draw if you receive exactly what you ordered. Bait and switch, get it?When I received my wallet the order form said 02 Coffee but it looked nothing like what I ordered, more like a cheap patent leather rip-off! It was very smooth and the color was more pale brown than dark coffee. What happened to that beautiful top grain texture? And I could not find the exact same wallet that I received in the marketing photos on Amazon's store page. So, did somebody ship me just any brown wallet they found at random?I hope not. Indeed, natural leathers can vary, and those top grain textures are typically added during the manufacturing process on genuine leathers. I realize that. But that's what I wanted. what I actually got looked more like a little kid's first wallet made from poly-urethane aka nubuck or PU leather. Kind of stiff like it too rather than soft and supple which top grain and genuine leather feels like. Substantially more glove leather-like would've been nice. What I got wasn't impressive at all! My warning to everybody is to beware that what you order might not be what you get -- if you're unlucky like me. But I'm not sending mine back, my old wallet was falling apart at the seams and I needed a new one pronto. But I might give this one to charity after I re-order -- just NOT a GintaXen wallet. Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice -- well, you get it...For a few dollars more I could've gotten a genuine Buxton top grain leather wallet that I know would've looked and felt like genuine leather! Or I could've gotten a Levi's wallet with RFID for about $10 more where quality and beauty is assured! Sorry, I cannot recommend GintaXen wallets. Buyer beware!",74325,4806,4807,0,"This product is not what is shown to be. The quality of the leather is below, below average. I do not like the texture of the wallet and it is not flexible like a higher-quality wallet would be. this was a gift for my husband, and he is not one to return things; as he is very grateful for anything I do for him. Either way, if it wouldn't had been for him needing a wallet as my son's dog chewed his last one, I would have returned this. Again, not good quality leather.",74326,4807,4808,2,"I had a bi-fold wallet before and was happy with it until it wore out. After reading the reviews and description of of this wallet I thought it would be better than my bi-fold. I have never been more wrong. I could not get all my plastic cards from my bi-fold to fit in this wallet. After using it for a while I learned to hate it. The one card holder is sewed into the wallet making like a hinge that flops open every time you open the wallet, making it cumbersome. They could have made it removable. But even then the card pockets are too small making it hard to get your cards in and out. It is already in my trash can.",74327,4808,4809,0,"One star because I had to give one to rate the product. The card slots are too small, and if you force a credit card in good luck in getting it out. I carry a good number of credit, ID ,etc. and I thought the number of slots would be an advantage. Wrong. If you fill all the slots, not only are the wedged in so tightly that you need pliers to get them out, the wallet is as thick as a dictionary. It was cheap so I'm not bothering to return it, but it will soon be an addition to my grandson's toy box.",74328,4809,4810,1,"I bought this wallet because it had so many reviews that seemed ok, the price was ok, and I do not use my wallet a whole lot so I had low expectations. Today, after using it for about three weeks, I finally threw it away. The wallet has a VERY strong chemical smell that even my husband noticed, and it left a 'tingling/itchy"" feeling on my skin whenever I touched it. I suppose this comes from the chemicals. The wallet is NOT a Swiss product, as the name misleads one to think, it is made in India. Even after giving it weeks to air out, the smell was still just as strong. I do not recommend buying this wallet. Invest the extra money to get a safe product from a trusted brand.",74329,4812,4813,0,"The wallet fell apart after 2 months. The stitching is poor and the material is too thin, so it tore apart. Don't trust the high star rating. There's too many sponsored and low quality reviews on this product. I bought this on an impulse and I deserve what I got. I should have scanned the reviews for these sponsored and fake reviews.Edit Jan 30, 2017: In fairness to the seller, I accepted a replacement two months ago and the it has held up better than the original. It's still intact, no stitching has been torn. May be I received a defective wallet the first time.",74330,4813,4814,0,"The wallet ripped along a seam after exactly 3 weeks. Cheap crap. The pockets were very hard to get my cards out of. The 2 I used most, my main card and my DL, were very tough to get while using this wallet, almost like someone had glued the cards in. It was seriously a struggle EVERY time to get a card out. I had to grip the card as hard as I could, then pull. Learned to pull in a way so I didn't hit myself in the face or hit other people once it finally came loose. At first I thought, well maybe my body heat is causing the cards to stick to the wallet material. Nope. I experimented by trying to get cards early in the morning when my wallet had been sitting out all night, I even pre-loosened the cards when I went to bed! Figured that it's just the breaking in period, eventually cards will slide easy, but the wallet ripped open after 3 weeks. Glad it happened inside the return window and glad amazon is so good for returns. I wasn't able to test the RFID blocking capability, but I would guess its quality is on par with the rest.",74331,4814,4815,1,"In fairness, a closer look at the picture on Amazon would have saved me returning this, as I could have seen if I zoomed in that this is not, as advertised, vegan leather (aka cork leather/cork fabric). Real vegan leather made of cork is pretty cool. It looks beautiful and is both soft and durable. It is not some chunks of cork lightly glued to a mesh with huge spaces in between.The wallet layout is great: reasonably thin, ID window, room for just the right amount of cards and a spot for folded bills (if you must). I will be looking for a similar design elsewhere. But while I can't actually speak for the other fabrics, if they are as cheaply constructed and fake as this cork ""fabric"" I would not recommend them. Spring a couple more bucks for something that's not going to disintegrate in your pocket!",74332,4815,4816,1,"I've had this wallet less than 6 months - the glue that holds it together is leaking into the card slots, which causes the cards to stick and get coated in the tacky glue.Would have expected this to last at least a year. The wallet itself externally is in perfect condition, but spending almost 5 minutes to get a card out, and now having to gently wash all my cards with soap and water is very discouraging.Would not recommend buying one until the quality issue is checked out.",74333,4816,4817,0,"The look of the wallet is not bad, but its not really good. Based on other reviews it seems there is a real lack in quality control and consistency. The one i received is so tight that it can barely hold 1 card in each slot and when they are full i cant open the center pocket for paper bills. If i add a card or something to the couple other internal slots its even worse.Regarding RFID blocking, as with any open wallet you have to be careful how you put your cards in. almost all cards with an RFID chip will have that chip on one end of the card or the other. if you hold the card up to a bright light you can usually see it. When testing this wallet i found that as long as the end of the card with the chip was put in first my reader could not pick up the card, however if the card is put in the other way, with the RFID tag outwards, then i could.Aso the ID slot does not provide any RFID protection, i assumed this in the beginning based on the original pictures. So those that have newer ID's that have RFID tags in them should be aware of this.",74334,4817,4818,0,"Solid construction and at first, it was great--but I noticed 3 very important and irritating things that make me regret the purchase:1. Most foreign currencies do not fit. Outside of the US, many countries have larger bills for larger amounts. I have been to at least 5 countries in the past year with currencies that are too large for this wallet (one of the reasons I got this was to protect my cards and money from getting wet while traveling.2. It holds credit cards so well that after just a few months of use, it will peel off/damage the edges of your credit/debit cards and other cards. Yes, you can call the credit card company to send you a new one for free anytime, but who wants to deal with that on a regular basis? Also, if a corner of the card breaks off when I'm trying to use it, that will be terrible. Of equal importance, it makes even a nice business credit card look worn and damaged...not the kind of thing you want to pull out at a restaurant with a client...3. Although it protects most of what's inside, you can't easily hold even 1-2 business cards in here, it will get very damaged before you even give it to someone (this is the case for most wallets, though).Point #3 is not a huge deal, but #1 and #2 are. I regret purchasing this product as a result--though it took me a long time to notice these issues so it was too late to return it.",74335,4818,4819,0,The worst thing about this product is the price. To expensive for some plastic. The second worst thing is that Dust still gets in it. I bought this wallet to protect my I.D.s and credit cards from dust and dirt that wears them out. For the price this should be built better. There should be a rubber seal that keeps dust out!,74336,4819,4820,2,"I switched to front pocket wallets a couple years ago and really haven't looked back. They seem to have more thought put into their design than back pocket ""Costanza"" wallets.I got sick of leather wallets getting over stretched. I'm coming from a Serman Brands wallet that had a very convenient pull tab for the main pocket and then a front card slot for my most frequently used card. I loved it but did not want to go in on another due to longevity issues.I don't know how I never came across this one before. I really liked the story about how it has evolved over the years. I also liked that it was a local company (Media, Pa). At $40 it was more than I wanted to spend but figured it would look at this one as an investment. After watching reviews on YouTube and reading here, I pulled the trigger.The Good:Super functional - everything works exceptionally wellCards don't fall out (really)SturdyCustomizable (with attachments)Comes in multiple colorsNice cash holderThe Bad:UGLY - there is just no way around this for me. It looks like a toy. I was a bit embarrassed taking it out at first but eventually got used to it because it is so darn functional. There are gaps all over the wallet also. It adds to the cheapness of the look IMO but maybe that's part of the evolution.Expensive - I paid $40 for this wallet but I honestly don't feel like I got a $40 wallet. There is just nothing that looser feels ""premium"" about it.Attachment purchase - I got the front card attachment from their website. The piece itself was overpriced for what it is (single piece of molded plastic). They also force you to pay shipping which I hate. Even being within 20 or 30 miles of their facility, it took quite a while to get to me.Thicker than I had thought- I'll try to get a picture on here. It bulges quite a bit in my pocket but not too bad.If you are definitely a function over form person, this will be great. It does work extremely well, I just now need to purchase another nicer wallet to have for other occasions. I guess I thought I could pull this off if it had a small enough footprint but it does not. I do plan to keep using it but will also keep an eye out for something a little nicer. I realize most other reviewers seem to disagree with me but hopefully this helps someone else make a more informed decision.",74337,4820,4821,0,"This product has received many great reviews. However imho, it has very limited space. The inside can only hold two cards on either side of that. The money clip is limited to only about not even 10 bills unless you want to put your money on the outside. The clip on the inside only allows one to have two cards if that. If someone wants to slide a business card while out doing business on a quick whim there isnÂ’t any room. Other rfid cases allow so much more room than this. Returning.",74338,4821,4822,0,"I think the wallet is ok quality - very plastic feeling and the size is a little small. I wish it was a little bigger to fit my notes without crunching them. I wish they would make a higher quality version of this wallet and a little larger.Also the customer service is not great - they gave me a lot of issues trying to order from their website and would not ship overseas - they didn't even bother responding to my emails asking to clarify my order, they would just cancel it. I finally just ordered it from Amazon.",74339,4822,4823,0,"I really liked this wallet at first - the slim factor was a great trade-up for my older wallet, and while I've never been a fan of money clips - I actually like that in this wallet. I could fit all my cards in it and liked the ID Window - so all around a satisfied purchase.......and then about a month after I started using it - the stitching around the ID Window came loose. Since I use it to hold my Drivers License, which I have to take out all the time, the ID Window gets a lot of use and pulled apart along the seams. So I'm in search of a replacement wallet.",74340,4823,4824,0,"While the wallet seems to be well made and of quality material, there are a few glaring design flaws that led me to stop using it after a few weeks. The biggest concern is that since the money clip has a slight bend at its end, the clip ended up digging into the cards that were placed across from it, leaving indents in them. The other flaw is that since the clip is so tight, it makes it difficult to easily utilize the two card slots directly behind it, as it required a lot of force to put in and take out cards from these two places.",74341,4824,4825,1,"I bought this because it was described as a ""slim"" wallet. It is not slim. When I received it, it was larger (while empty) than my current wallet filled with cards and cash. The wallet is very nice and seems to be very well made, but I had to return it because it was much too big for me. The description is a little misleading. If you're looking for a nice, average-sized bifold wallet, this would be a good choice. If you're looking for a slim wallet, I would not recommend this one.",74342,4825,4826,0,"I liked the idea of having a slot on the front of the wallet for frequent cards. after having this wallet for a while the other slots are a little too tight for me and I really don't think they will improve over time. also the money clip makes it more difficult to place and remove cards on that side. I'm sure there are people that like this wallet, it's just not for me.",74343,4826,4827,0,"I have wondered if a minimalist wallet would be something I'd use ( I carry a lot of stuff in my wallet) BUT the picture of the TRAVANDO appealed to my sense of aesthetics. / Black with a orge/tan interior.

Oh the gift box IS very impressive As a gift .. NO ONE will say this was an under $30USD gift.My ONLY complaints:it smells of chemicals NOT real leather. (PLEATHER) Protein leatherThe money clip pressure interferes with 3 pockets. It is difficult to use and you do not want to put anything there if you want quick access.",7
